Privacy Policy
The Cleveland Clinic Center for Continuing Education (The Center) respects your privacy. We will not sell or rent your personal information. We will use this data solely to communicate to you information on various continuing medical education (CME) and educational activities that may be of interest and for no other purpose.
There are three ways in which we collect personally identifiable information through our online CME Community on our Website clevelandclinicmeded.com. The first is upon sign-up to the community whereby a user provides a name, address, email address, telephone number, credentials, and areas of interest. This information is stored in a database.              
The second way we collect information is when an online user completes an educational activity and applies for CME credit.  This information is stored in a database so that the Center may track the number of online CME participants who wish to obtain CME credit. This record-keeping is required by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education.              
The third way we collect personally identifiable information is during enrollment for our email update service. Users are asked to provide contact information in order to receive alerts relating to online CME activities, including surveys so that the Center can meet the greatest need and interest of the community. An opt-out form enables news alert subscribers to unsubscribe at any time.              
We do not distribute unsolicited emails, nor permit use of this subscriber data by other institutions or other third-party organizations.
