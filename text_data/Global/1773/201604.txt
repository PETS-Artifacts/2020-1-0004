How Do We Protect Your Information?
Any customer information received by TypingMaster directly, from its authorized resellers or from its online registration service providers (see below) is hosted on a secured server that does not allow access to the public.

Except for the circumstances set forth in the previous paragraph, we will not knowingly distribute customer information to be used in mailing lists, surveys, or any other purpose other than what is required to perform our services.
