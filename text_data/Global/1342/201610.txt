This Privacy Notice describes the personal information we collect from our customers through the Cartier client relations center, online, over the telephone and in our boutiques.

During this process, you will be required to provide valid and up-to-date personal information, including but not limited to your real name, date of birth, phone number and e-mail address, as well as other personal information as applicable, such as shipping address, billing address and payment details (collectively "Personal Information").

respond to your request or activate your option choices.
