A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file may contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you have visited and to allow easy access to restricted areas of the web site. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk, read cookie files created by other sites, or damage your files.If you have set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet service provider, such as AOL), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites).Use of the Information CollectedNewRepublic.com uses information you voluntarily submit to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to move seamlessly through our web site and to communicate with users with legal notices, notices of material changes to terms and conditions, privacy policy, rules, etc., and account status. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (weekly) and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. With respect to advertisements, an advertiser will inform us which type of audience it seeks to reach, and tnr.com, through Mailchimp, will place the advertisement in the body of the email newsletter of those individuals fitting the advertiser's criteria. Pop-up advertisements may be displayed to a targeted audience based on the same criteria. The advertisers are not able to access your account or any of your personally identifiable information.We also use tracking information to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas.NewRepublic.com creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their interests.
