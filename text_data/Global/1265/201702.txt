Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Sites or App(s), you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, We will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
Do KFC's Sites and App(s) link to other sites?
Yes. The Sites and App(s) may contain links to other websites that may not be owned or operated by KFC.

KFC encourages you to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to Personal Information collected on the Sites and App(s).
How will KFC notify me of changes to its Privacy Policy?
KFC will post any changes to the Policy on the Sites' Homepages so visitors are always aware of any changes to what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. The new terms may be displayed on-screen and you may be required to read and accept them to continue your use of the Sites or the App(s). If we decide to use your Personal Information in a manner different than first communicated, KFC will notify users by e-mail to the e-mail addresses on record.

If you are under 12, please do not use our Sites or App(s).
