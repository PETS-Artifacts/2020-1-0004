It is important for you to know how we collect, store and use the personal information that you give to us.
First of all, we should tell you who we mean by “we”. KFC stores in the UK and Republic of Ireland are owned and operated either by the company Kentucky Fried Chicken (Great Britain) Limited or by one of its franchisees. KFC and its franchisees are all committed to protecting your privacy but, just to be clear, each KFC franchisee is an independent business and is responsible for the operation of its own stores. This means that each franchisee is also responsible for ensuring its own compliance with data protection laws.
So in the policy, references to ‘KFC’, ‘we’, ‘us’ and ‘our’ do not include KFC franchisees – they refer to the KFC company Kentucky Fried Chicken (Great Britain) Limited. If you would like to talk to any of our franchisees about their privacy policies, please contact that store or franchisee directly.
In this policy you will find answers to a number of questions about how and why we collect, use and share your personal information. If you have any other questions about our Privacy Policy or the use of your personal information, please write to:

We know that this might seem like a lot, but we use all of this information to make your KFC experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. For more details of how we use the information we collect, read the answer to the question WHAT DOES KFC DO WITH MY INFORMATION? below.
WHAT DOES KFC DO WITH MY INFORMATION?
We have given a brief explanation of why we need to collect each particular piece of information about you in the  WHAT INFORMATION DOES KFC COLLECT ABOUT ME? section above. Here is a bit more detail on what we do with the information that you give us. We may need to use your information:

•	to process, administer and take payment for your delivery order through our websites or apps;
•	to contact you to fulfil prizes in any competitions you have entered;

•	to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations (e.g. in connection with a fraud prevention scheme, court order, government investigation, or when otherwise required by law).
These are just examples and this list may be updated from time to time as business needs and legal requirements dictate. We will let you know if we decide or need to use your personal information in a considerably different way to those that we have previously told you about. We will keep your information for as long as is necessary for us to fulfil the purposes set out above.
WHO DOES KFC SHARE MY INFORMATION WITH?
In order for us to achieve some of the things that we have set out in the WHAT INFORMATION DOES KFC COLLECT ABOUT ME? and WHAT DOES KFC DO WITH MY INFORMATION sections above, we may need to share your information with carefully chosen third parties. These may include:
•	agencies who help us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations or to carry out background checks for the purposes of processing payments or any applications made by you (e.g. credit reference agencies, credit card clearing agencies and fraud prevention and detection agencies);
•	payment processing providers and delivery companies that we use to take payment for and process delivery orders that you make with us through our website or apps;
•	data analysts and research companies who help to give us an insight into how we can better serve you and all of our other customers - we may ask these companies to contact you directly for your opinions on our products and services;
•       companies who help us to ensure that the content of our websites, apps and social media pages and our advertisements are presented in the most effective and relevant manner for you; and
•	other companies within our company’s group (and only to people within those companies who actually need to know these details to carry out their functions). This policy will apply if we share your personal information with any of our group companies.
In all cases, we enter into written agreements with any third party companies that we work with requiring them to put in place safeguards to protect your personal information. We will only provide these third party companies with the information that they need to carry out the services that we have asked them to – they are not allowed to use your information for their own purposes. We will never pass on your details to third parties for them to send you unwanted marketing, unless you have positively agreed to receive this marketing. If you are receiving unwanted marketing messages or have previously opted out and have now changed your mind and would like to receive marketing from some of the other companies that we work with, please email us at kfcuk@marketforce.com.
As KFC and its group companies operate globally, it may be necessary for us to transfer your personal information to third parties, such as the ones set out above, that are based outside of the European Economic Area. If we need to do this, we will ensure that they have adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information. If you object to this transfer, please contact us at this email address: kfcuk@marketforce.com.
