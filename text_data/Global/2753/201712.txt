Welcome! You have arrived at BigLots.com and/or are otherwise interacting with the Service (defined below), which is owned and operated by an affiliate of Big Lots Stores, Inc. This User Agreement constitutes an agreement between you and Big Lots Stores, Inc. and its parent, affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, "Big Lots," "we," "our" or "us") (the "Agreement"), and applies to all our websites, including microsites and mobile sites, all products and services offered to you when you visit our websites, and all other online service features, databases, plug-ins, applications, content, downloads, applications, platforms, and tools where this User Agreement appears or is linked (collectively the "Service"), regardless of how you access or use it, whether via computer, mobile device or otherwise. By using the Service, you accept this Agreement and our Privacy Policy, and certify that you are above the age of majority in your jurisdiction.
Each time you access and/or use the Service (other than to simply read this Agreement), you agree to be bound by and comply with this Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms (defined below) then posted. Therefore, do not use the Service if you do not agree. The business realities associated with operating the Service are such that, without the conditions that are set forth in this Agreement such as your grants and waivers of rights, the limitations on our liability, your indemnity of us, and our arbitration of certain disputes Big Lots would not make the Service available to you.
In some instances, both this Agreement and separate guidelines, rules, or terms of service or sale setting forth additional or different terms and/or conditions will apply to your use of the Service or to a service or product offered via the Service (in each such instance, and collectively "Additional Terms"). Additional Terms may apply to some products and services offered on the Service and may be found at the place where the relevant product or service is offered. To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Additional Terms, the Additional Terms will control unless the Additional Terms expressly state otherwise.

We may also host our content, apps and tools on Third Party Services. Big Lots is not responsible for the content of any Third Party Services. Your use of a Third Party Service linked from the Service is at your own risk and will be governed by such third party's terms and policies.
References on the Service to any names, marks, products, or services of third parties, or links to Third Party Services or information are not an endorsement, sponsorship, or recommendation of the third party, its information, products, or services. Big Lots is not responsible for the quality or delivery of the products or services offered, accessed, obtained by or advertised at such Third Party Services. Some Third Party Services may impose fees for access to their resources through our Service and/or your account and you are responsible for all such fees. Finally, we will under no circumstances be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental or special loss or other damage, whether arising from negligence, breach of contract, defamation, infringement of copyright or other intellectual property rights, caused by the exhibition, distribution or exploitation of any information or content contained within these Third Party Services.

IV. ORDERS

A. Acceptance and Billing. All billing information provided must be truthful and accurate. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ORDER. By submitting such information, you grant to Big Lots the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of orders initiated by you or on your behalf. Providing any false, untruthful or inaccurate information constitutes a breach of this Agreement for which we may cancel your order. Before accepting an order we may request additional information from you. We may refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on the quantities available, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance partners. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Big Lots may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.
By confirming your purchase during the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s). You will not be charged for most orders until the order ships. You will be charged at the time your order is placed for: (1) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card or PayPal account; and (2) any orders paid using the in-store "Cash" payment method.
Big Lots reserves the right to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order for any reason. These restrictions may apply to orders placed by the same account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. If such limits are applied, we will notify you. Big Lots also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers of any kind.


B. Pricing and Tax Information. Big Lots cannot confirm the final price of an item (including any estimated tax or other charges) until after your order is placed. You may access up-to-date order information by visiting www.biglots.com/orders. Any applicable taxes, tax reimbursements or other applicable government fees or impositions are charged or collected for orders shipped to the U.S. The amount of any such charges is based on current rates. The sales tax rate applied to your order will generally be at the combined state and local rate for the address where your order is shipped. Estimated tax displayed during your order and on your packing slip is only an estimate, as many factors can change between the time you place your order and when your order ships. The actual amount of tax, government fees or impositions Big Lots collects may be different than the amount shown when you placed your order or on your packing slip, as such actual amount is not calculated until the time of shipment. Gift-wrap and delivery or shipping charges may also be subject to collection of tax, government fees or impositions in applicable jurisdictions. The applicable tax, government fees or impositions will be refunded for returned items, in accordance with applicable state laws. Gift Cards purchased at BigLots.com or at a Big Lots store are not taxable (but purchases made with gift cards may be subject to taxes, tax reimbursements, or other government fees or impositions). Government laws and rates are subject to change at any time. Certain purchases may be made while a tax-free event is effective (e.g. sales tax holiday). Eligibility and participation may vary, so visit the applicable jurisdiction's website for complete details. If you are not charged sales tax on a purchase made via the Service, you may owe "use tax" to your state of residency.
SHIPMENTS TO A SOUTH DAKOTA ADDRESS: YOU MAY OWE USE TAX DIRECTLY TO THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA. In regards to merchandise purchased on Service and shipped to South Dakota, you should be aware that, unless your purchase is specifically excluded from South Dakota sales tax, South Dakota law requires each South Dakota purchaser to report any purchase that was not taxed and to pay applicable taxes on the purchase. The tax may be reported and paid on the South Dakota use tax form. The use tax form and related instructions are available on the South Dakota Department of Revenue website. This notice is required for South Dakota delivered purchases based on Senate Bill No. 146.
Pricing errors may occur on the Service from time to time. Big Lots reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Big Lots. Big Lots may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Service or from prices available in Big Lots stores or on Big Lots mobile applications (pricing and availability remain subject to confirmation at checkout for mobile users). It is also important to note that the Service may, in our sole discretion, offer a price match for identical merchandise sold in our stores or by other online retailers that also maintain brick-and-mortar store locations. See our complete Price Match Policy for details, the terms of which are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.


C. Colors and Sizes. We have made significant efforts to accurately display the products that appear on the Service, including features such as colors and product sizes. However, we cannot guarantee that your monitor's display will accurately reflect actual product color, finish, or size. The actual colors you see when you view the Service depend on your monitor and your settings. Product sizes may vary based on manufacturer, and different products from the same manufacturer may have different sizes.


D. Shipping, Delivery, and Risk of Loss. Delivery of items purchased from the Service to addresses outside the United States is limited. Some items also have restricted delivery within the United States. Some items may be available for pick up at physical store locations. Delivery times will be determined based on the method of shipping chosen when items are purchased and the destination of the items. Shipping and delivery charges could attract certain governmental charges, including taxes. Please see Pricing and Tax Information above and our Shipping Frequently Asked Questions for additional information.
Except as otherwise set forth herein, the risk of loss for and title to merchandise purchased on the Service passes to the purchaser upon tender of the merchandise to the carrier.


E. Returns. You may return your purchase in accordance with our Return Policy, the terms of which are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement. Big Lots does not take title to returned merchandise until the merchandise return is processed and approved at a Big Lots location (i.e., at a Big Lots store or distribution center).


G. Gift Cards. All gift cards are issued by Big Lots Stores, Inc. and are deemed purchased in and issued from the State of Ohio. The risk of loss and title to gift cards passes to the purchaser upon our electronic transmission to the recipient or delivery to the carrier, whichever is applicable. Gift cards may or may not, at Big Lots discretion, be an accepted form of payment on the Service. For full terms and conditions related to gift cards, please see the back of the gift card.




V. INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS

A. Procedure for Alleging Copyright Infringement. We respect the intellectual property of others. We will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged copyright infringement by third parties and will take necessary action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) ("DMCA"), where appropriate, in accordance with our DMCA policy.
Pursuant to the DMCA, a notification of alleged copyright infringement by a third party should be sent to our designated agent. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been infringed under U.S. copyright law and is accessible on the Service, please notify us by contacting our designated agent. Even if you believe that the alleged infringing work was not posted by a third party, please send all notifications of alleged copyright infringement to Big Lots' designated agent listed below.
To be effective under the DMCA, a notice of alleged copyright infringement by third parties must be a written communication to our designated agent that includes the following:

A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;
Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;
Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;
Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;
A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and
A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Our designated agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows:
By Mail:
Big Lots Stores, Inc.
Attn: Office of the General Counsel (Copyright Infringement Claim)
300 Phillipi Road
Columbus, Ohio 43228
Telephone: 1-866-BIG-LOTS (244-5687)
This contact information is only for reporting claims of copyright infringement. Contact information for other matters is provided elsewhere in this Agreement.
Upon receipt of a valid notification of alleged copyright infringement by a third party, Big Lots will remove or disable access to the material identified in the notice, forward the written notification to the alleged infringer, and take reasonable efforts to notify the alleged infringer that it has removed or disabled access to this material. Big Lots reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to remove or disable access to the Service to any user at any time, including repeat alleged-infringers.
Be aware that, under the DMCA, claimants who make misrepresentations concerning copyright infringement may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by the alleged infringer or by Big Lots, if injured by relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.
If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed against you, you may file a counter notification with the designated agent at the address listed above.
To be effective, a counter notification must be a written communication provided to the Big Lots' designated agent that includes the following:

A physical or electronic signature;
Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located and that you will accept service of process from the complainant who provided the original notification or an agent of such person or entity.

If we receive a valid counter notification, we will provide the complainant with a copy of the counter notification, inform the complainant that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 to 14 business days from receipt of the counter notification, and replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 to 14 business days, provided that we have not received notice from the complainant that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system.
You should be aware that the DMCA provides substantial penalties for a false counter notice filed in response to a notice of copyright infringement. Claimants who make misrepresentations in their the counter notification statement may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, incurred by any copyright owner or copyright owner's authorized licensee, or by Big Lots, if injured by relying upon such misrepresentation in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.

VI. DISPUTES; GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION

A. Disputes. Except as specifically stated herein, you agree that any disputes, actions, and claims relating to your use of the Service and all matters arising out of or related to the Agreement and any applicable Additional Terms (collectively "Disputes" or a "Dispute") shall be resolved exclusively by final binding arbitration, except that you may assert claims in small claims court in the county of your residence or in Columbus, Ohio, if your claims qualify. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. All of the AAA's rules are available at https://www.adr.org/, and the rules governing consumer disputes are available at https://www.adr.org/consumer. The AAA's rules, including the rules governing consumer disputes, are also available by calling 1-800-778-7879. You may initiate arbitration by utilizing the forms available on www.adr.org. If you have any difficulty initiating arbitration, you may call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. You and Big Lots are each giving up the right to have disputes resolved in court before a judge and/or jury (except as stated otherwise in this Section VI). The provisions of this Section VI constitute your and Big Lots' written agreement for resolving Disputes, including the agreement to arbitrate Disputes under the Federal Arbitration Act ("Dispute Agreement"). The most current version of this Dispute Agreement in effect when any Dispute arises shall govern resolution of any Dispute.
Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees ("Arbitration Fees") will be governed by the AAA's rules. You agree to commence arbitration only in your county of residence or in Columbus, Ohio. We will reimburse to you Arbitration Fees you paid for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary. The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Agreement.


Governing Law.  You agree that all Disputes will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), applicable Federal Law, and laws of the State of Ohio, without regard to conflicts of law principles.


C. No Class Action Matters. You and Big Lots each agree that resolution of any Disputes, whether in court or in arbitration, will be conducted and resolved only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action, and that any relief awarded, including equitable relief, shall only be awarded on an individual basis. 


D. Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you or Big Lots may bring suit in court to seek an injunction, a declaratory judgment or other equitable relief arising out of, or relating to, enforcement of Section I and Section II of the Agreement, or claims related to the validity or enforcement of your or our intellectual property rights.


E. No Jury Trial; Choice of Law and Forum for Court Proceedings.  If for any reason a Dispute proceeds in court, other than for Disputes brought in a small claims court for qualifying claims, you and Big Lots agree: (i) that any such Dispute may only be brought in a state or federal court in Columbus, Ohio, to be governed by the FAA, applicable Federal Law, and the laws of Ohio, without regard to conflict of law principles; (ii) to further irrevocably consent and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts in Columbus, Ohio; and, (iii) to waive any right to a trial by jury.


F. Severability. With the exception of Section VI(C), if any part of this Section VI is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then the remaining provisions of Section VI shall remain in force as if any portion ruled unenforceable were not included in this Section VI. If Section VI(C) is ruled to be unenforceable for any reason, then Section VI(A) shall no longer be enforceable, but the remainder of this Section VI shall remain in effect.
