Privacy
In short, we respect your privacy and ask that you do the same to others that use the site.
We strongly recommend that you never give other people access to your password or publish personal details such as your real name, email address, phone numbers, or link to personal sites that may have these details. We also recommend that you use a different password to access your user ID on TWTD as using the same password on all your favourite sites may compromise your security.
Cookies are used to remember who you are from one page to the next. This is standard practice and enables you to log in and participate in the forums and other interactive features.
For security reasons we log your IP address and each page request made to the server. This data is only available to us and will not be passed on to a third party unless legally required to do so. We reserve the right to ban users and take appropriate action in the event of site abuse.
Advertisements on the site are largely provided by a third party. They may serve ads which they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on your visit to this and other websites (this information is anonymous in that it does not include your name, street address, email address or telephone number). In order to do this, our advertising partners may wish to place a cookie on your computer. For more information about this type of online behavioural advertising, cookies and how to turn off this feature, visit www.youronlinechoices.co.uk.
