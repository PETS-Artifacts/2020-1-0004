COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
For services provided on or in connection with our Sites, we may ask you to provide personal information such as name, email address, phone number and zip code, and personally identifiable information, and may or may not include any other information provided by or for you, and/or provided by any other person for whom you may be seeking senior housing and/or care services ("Personal Information"). We may collect and store any Personal Information. 
In addition, we may use Web site analytics tools, or other technologies, like cookies and Web beacons, to collect information about your visit to the Sites, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with the Sites and our services. We also may collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every Web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. We also periodically may obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from other businesses, business partners, contractors and other third parties which supplements the Personal Information we collect, use and disclose.
Like many Web Sites, we use "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences.  We use cookies to track use of our Sites and online services.  We also may use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Sites and make the Sites easier and/or relevant for your use.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. In Internet Explorer 8, you can delete cookies by selecting "Tools", "Delete browsing history". Then select the control box "Cookies" and click the "Delete" button. If you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, including advertising preferences, will be deleted and may need to be recreated. 
We also use cookies to improve the performance of our advertising on other websites.

Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy apply to information gathered online at our Sites, and to information that you may submit to us offline; to Web sites maintained by other companies, or organizations to which we may link; and to Personal Information we may collect further from third parties. 
USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We use Personal Information to provide you with the services you have requested from us and to provide services to the senior housing and care providers who have contracted with us ("Participating Communities") to be part of our referral information service program in relation to the services that we provide you. In addition, we use Personal Information to send you periodic email and newsletter communications about products and services offered by us or third parties, to operate and improve our Sites and services, to respond to customer inquiries, and to send you survey or other communications.  
We use Personal Information also for our own internal business purposes including statistical, design or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns and understand demographic trends among our users.
DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
We may disclose, sell or share Personal Information about you with other people including: 

Participating Communities. We may disclose, sell or share Personal Information to one or more Participating Communities in order to provide you with the services you’ve requested.

We do not control how these Participating Communities use or disclose your Personal Information. 
Other Third Party Providers. We may disclose, sell or share Personal Information to one or more third parties with whom we have contracted to provide services to us.

We may disclose Personal Information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with the law; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy or our other policies or agreements; to protect our or our users' rights, property or safety; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive or unlawful use of, our Sites; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 
Business Transfers. We may disclose Personal Information as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of company assets or other business transaction.
Aggregated Information: We may share aggregated, anonymous information that includes or is based on information about you with third parties.

Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information. We also may not limit the third parties’ use of the aggregated information. 

USE OF NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION
Non-personal information collected at the Sites may be used and disclosed to improve the performance, functionality and content of the Sites.  For example, we may collect and analyze collected aggregate information to determine how many visitors arrived at certain pages of the Sites, how long they stayed on those pages, and where they went afterwards.  This information allows us to determine which pages might be the most interesting to our users and enables us to provide you with a richer experience on the Sites.  Additionally, we may use non-personal information to improve the performance of the Sites and to customize the content, features and layout of the Sites pages for you.
Occasionally we share aggregate information with third parties, such as our advertisers and business partners, for marketing and promotional purposes.
We may supplement aggregate information collected from the Sites with similar information obtained from companies with whom we have marketing or other business relationships and other third party sources.  If aggregate information is ever linked with your Personal Information, such information will be treated as Personal Information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy as long as it is linked.
