In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive\n                                personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.  \n                                We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business.

Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that\n                                information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others.
