       Jeppesen relies on a wide variety of information to run our business. In some instances, this information may include data that could be used to identify a particular individual, otherwise referred to as Personal Data (PD).  So that we may provide you with our products and services, Jeppesen processes your PD to meet the requirements of our legitimate business interests, and legal, statutory and contractual obligations.
    

       In this Privacy Policy, we provide multiple examples of how Personal Data we collect may be used and why it is important. For example, when a customer purchases one of our products or services we must collect, at a minimum, their name, address and payment information to complete the transaction.

Jeppesen’s Policy on Sensitive Personal Data


       Jeppesen does not knowingly or intentionally collect sensitive Personal Data (PD) from individuals, and you must not submit sensitive PD to us. “Sensitive Personal Data” is information about an individual that reveals their racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic information, biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying an individual, information concerning health or information concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.
    

       Pursuant to Article 9(2)(a) of the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, if you inadvertently or intentionally transmit sensitive PD to us, you will be considered to have explicitly consented to us processing that sensitive PD.  We will use and process your Sensitive Personal Data for the express purpose of deleting it.
    

        
    

How Do We Use Personal Data?


       Jeppesen takes your privacy very seriously and we will strive to avoid collecting any unnecessary personal data from you and not process your information in a way other than as specified in this Privacy Policy. We will not purposefully disclose, share or sell your Personal Data (PD) without your consent, unless required to do so by law.
    

Uses of Personal Data includes: 



        Uses within specific Jeppesen products and/or services.
      

        Undertaking normal and reasonable business activities. 
      

        Managing an individual's relationship with Jeppesen.
      

        Improving Jeppesen products, sites and services (by itself or in combination with data from other Jeppesen offerings or third parties.)
      

        Detection, prevention, investigation and prosecution of crime.
      

        Administration and management of PD related to Employees (i.e. benefits, use of company assets, salary planning, etc.)
      

        Allow you to download and purchase products and services.
      

        Investigating, responding to, and managing inquiries or events.
      

        Work with and respond to law enforcement and regulators.
      

        Research matters relating to our business such as security threats and vulnerabilities.
      


        
    

How Do We Retain Personal Data (PD)?


       Jeppesen retains personal data for as long as necessary to provide its products and services and to fulfill requested transactions, or for other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different products, actual retention periods can vary.
    

The criteria used to determine the retention periods include:



        How long is the PD needed to provide the products and operate our business? This includes such things as maintaining and improving the performance of those products, keeping our systems secure, and maintaining appropriate business and financial records. This is the general rule that establishes the baseline for most data retention periods.
      

        Has the user provided consent for a longer retention period? If so, we will retain data in accordance with your consent.
      

        Is Jeppesen subject to a legal, contractual, relevant agreed industry practices, or similar obligations to retain the data?
      

        The level of risk, cost and liability involved with Jeppesen continuing to hold the information.
      

        How hard it is to ensure that the information can be kept up to date and accurate.
      

        Any relevant surrounding circumstances (such as the nature and status of our relationship with you).
      


        
    

What Security Measures Do We Have?


       Although we work hard to protect Personal Data (PD) that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and Jeppesen cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose PD.  We use administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to secure your PD and to protect it against unauthorized or unlawful use and accidental loss or destruction, including:
    


        Where appropriate, only sharing and providing access to your information to the minimum extent necessary, subject to confidentiality restrictions, and on an anonymized basis whenever possible.
      

        Using secure servers to store your information.
      

        Verifying the identity of any individual who requests access to information prior to granting them access to information.
      

        Using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software or other similar encryption technologies to encrypt any payment transactions you make on or via our website.
      

        Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.
      

        Under our practices and policies, access to sensitive PD is authorized only for those who have a business need for such access.
      

        PD and other sensitive records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business, accounting, tax or legal purposes.
      

        Jeppesen maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store.
      

        If you become aware of a security issue, please contact Jeppesen at Privacy@Jeppesen.com . We will work with you to address any problems.
      


        
    

Cookies


       We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. If you continue without changing your web browser settings, we’ll assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Jeppesen website. However, if you would like to, you can change your cookie settings on your web browser at any time.
    

What is a Cookie?


       Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).
    

       Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site – for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognize you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.
    

       Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits. Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).
    

What is in a Cookie?


       A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each cookie is unique to your web browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.
    

What to do if you don’t want cookies to be set.


       Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their computer or mobile device a bit intrusive, particularly when this information is stored and used by a third party without their knowledge. Although this is generally quite harmless you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests. If you prefer, it is possible to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set; but you need to be aware that you might lose some website functionality. If you don’t want to receive cookies, you can modify your browser so that it notifies you when cookies are sent to it or you can refuse cookies altogether. You can also delete cookies that have already been set.
    

       If you wish to restrict or block web browser cookies which are set on your device then you can do this through your browser settings.  The Help function within your web browser should tell you how this is done. Alternatively, you may wish to visit www.aboutcookies.org, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.

Consent to Transfer, Processing and Storage of Personal Data (PD) – Privacy Shields


       As Jeppesen is a global organization, we may transfer your PD to Jeppesen in the United States of America (US), to any Jeppesen subsidiary worldwide, or to third parties and business partners as described above that are located in various countries around the world. By use of our websites and Solutions, or providing any PD to Jeppesen where applicable law permits, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.
    

       Jeppesen safeguards and enables the global transfer of Personal Data by participation in the:
    

EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shields


       Jeppesen participates in and has certified its compliance with the EU-U.S. and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks and Principles as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union (EU) and Switzerland, respectively. Jeppesen is committed to subjecting all personal data received from European Union (EU) member countries and Switzerland, in reliance on the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks, to the Frameworks’ applicable Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.  To learn more about these Privacy Shield Frameworks, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield site. 


       Jeppesen is responsible for the processing of Personal Data (PD) it receives, under these Privacy Shield Frameworks, and subsequently transfers to a third party acting as an agent on its behalf. Jeppesen complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of PD from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions. In certain situations, Jeppesen may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
    

       With respect to PD received or transferred pursuant to these Privacy Shield Frameworks, Jeppesen is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.
