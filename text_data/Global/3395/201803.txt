       Date of Last Revision: 27 April 2017
    

       Thank you for reviewing the Jeppesen Privacy Policy. Jeppesen Sanderson, Inc. and its family of companies (“Jeppesen”) are sensitive to the issue of confidentiality in online interactions and are committed to protecting individual privacy across our range of websites, products and services.
    

1. Purpose


       This privacy policy applies to Jeppesen with respect to compliance with applicable law and regulations regarding Personal Information. This policy establishes high-level responsibilities to ensure that the collection, use, disclosure and retention of Personal Information comply with applicable law and regulations in multiple jurisdictions. Due to variations in the regulations, many aspects of compliance can only be implemented at the local level.
    

1.1 What if data is transmitted internationally?


       Visitors may want to know whether their personal information will be transferred out of their country of origin. Please be aware that when registering or requesting a transaction on Jeppesen Sites, Jeppesen reserves the right to transfer the visitor’s personal data to computers in the United States or any other country where Jeppesen or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. The data protection laws in these countries may be different from, and less stringent than the visitor’s country of residence. By using the Sites or by providing any personal or other information to Jeppesen, express consent is given to Jeppesen to conduct such transfers and processing. Jeppesen takes steps to ensure that the data collected under this Policy is processed according to the provisions of this Policy and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.
    

2. Application of Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP)


       Jeppesen is committed to providing reasonable protection from loss, inappropriate use, or inappropriate disclosure of the Personal Information that is entrusted to the company. In an effort to provide protection that is as consistent as possible for all individuals who provide Personal Information to the company, Jeppesen has established a privacy program that is based on the Generally Accepted Privacy Principles (GAPP) identified by the Assurance Services Executive Committee (ASEC) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Assurance Services Development Board (ASDB) of the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA). These ten principles (covering Management, Notice, Choice and Consent, Collection, Use and Retention, Access, Disclosure to Third Parties, Security for Privacy, Quality, Monitoring and Enforcement) were developed to serve as a universal framework of privacy best practices that companies can use to evaluate their programs and develop sound policies and practices.
    

2.1 Management

2.2 Notice


       Jeppesen will notify individuals about the purposes for which they collect, use, disclose and retain information about them. Jeppesen will also provide information about how individuals can contact Jeppesen with any inquiries or complaints, the types of third parties to which it discloses the information and the choices and means Jeppesen offers for limiting its collection, use, disclosure and retention.
    

2.3 Choice and Consent


       Jeppesen will give individuals the opportunity to choose when their Personal Information will be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.
    

2.4 Collection


       Personal Information is collected for the reasons provided in the Uses Permitted. This defined scope is included in the Product or Service privacy notice. If the scope requires redefinition, the privacy notice will be reissued and Data Collection will be subject to 2.3 Choice and Consent once again.
    

2.4.1 Special Notice Regarding Children


       Jeppesen Sites are not designed for, nor is Personal Information knowingly collected from children under the age of 13. Children under 13 years of age should not provide Personal Information to Jeppesen or Affiliates. Users of the Services available on the Sites must be at least 18 years old and competent to enter into a contract. Children under the age of 18 may only use the Services with involvement of a parent or guardian.
    

2.4.2 Third Party Sites


       Jeppesen websites may contain links to other sites, or other interactive forums hosted by a third party. Jeppesen may also use certain third party sites such as Facebook, YouTube, iTunes and Google Play, for purposes such as providing information about products and services, communicating with Customers and the general public, or distributing Jeppesen products or services. These websites may also include buttons, tools, or content that link to third parties (for example, a Facebook "Like" button). Information may also be collected concerning Customer use of these features. In addition, when interacting with these buttons, tools, or content, or viewing a Jeppesen web page containing them, some Customer browser information may automatically be sent to that third party. Jeppesen is not responsible for the non-Jeppesen content or the privacy practices of such other sites. Customers are encouraged to read the privacy policies of any third party web site that collects information. Similarly, if entering Jeppesen websites via another web site, Jeppesen is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices of that site, and the privacy policy of the third-party site should be reviewed before providing any information to that site. This Policy applies solely to Personal Information collected by Jeppesen.
    

2.4.3 Collection from Social Media sites


       Personal Information may also be collected in connection with "liking", posting, commenting or otherwise contacting Jeppesen or its Affiliates via web pages or content that Jeppesen administers on third-party sites such as Facebook or YouTube.
    

2.4.4 Use of cookies, IP addresses and web beacons


       Jeppesen advertises online in a variety of ways, including displaying ads across the Internet and on the Sites. Information is collected about which ads are displayed, which ads are clicked on, and on which web page the ad was displayed.
    

       The Sites and some services and advertisements may contain "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that is stored on an individual’s hard drive and records preferences and other data about a visit to the Sites. Like many websites, Jeppesen.com does not currently respond to “do not track” browser headers. Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) may also be used on the Sites. E-mails sent may include a clear gif that tells whether an e-mail was received or opened, or if a link within the e-mail was clicked. Individuals may opt out of receiving marketing communications. Jeppesen or its Affiliates may also use a third party advertising company to display ads on the Sites.
    

       NOTE: If cookies are blocked, some portions of the Sites may not function properly.
    

2.4.5 Collection and use of location data


       When using Jeppesen sites, actual location information may be collected and processed. Various technologies are used to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. Location data is used in accordance with the section ‘Uses Permitted', and disclosed in accordance with the section ‘Use, retention and disposal'.
    

2.5 Use, retention and disposal


       Jeppesen will use an individual’s Personal Information only for Uses Permitted stated herein or in the Product or Service privacy notice and will only be provided to parties with a need to know. Reasonable attempts to use anonymized data will be made prior to disclosure.
    

       When an account is terminated, Jeppesen will only be entitled to retain Personal Information pursuant to applicable information retention policies. Personal Information will be deleted at the conclusion of the applicable retention policy retention period.
    

2.6 Access


       Individuals may request access to Personal Information about them that Jeppesen holds and be able to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual's privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. If an individual would like to have access to Personal Information Jeppesen holds about them, please e-mail privacy@jeppesen.com, or write to Jeppesen, Data Privacy Office, 55 Inverness Drive East, Englewood, CO 80112, USA.
