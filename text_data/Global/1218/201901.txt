IDEO Network Account Registration and Sign on 

*Please note if you registered for our products before April 2018 this process may not apply to you. On March 27th, 2018, IDEO began a process of consolidating access to some of its Sites under one global secure login account process, which will give Users access to a network of IDEO services, and for those Users who participate individually or under a Client contract to more than one IDEO Site, one convenient login for the IDEO Network (an “IDEO Network Account”). If the service you want to access has been consolidated under this process you will see a general IDEO registration page when you register or login. If the Site you are accessing has not yet been integrated into the IDEO Network Account process, you will be directed straight to that individual Site.
 
Account Creation & Profile: To register for an IDEO Network Account, you must provide your email address, first name, last name, and you will be asked to choose a secure password. As part of this process, you will be given an “IDEO Network Profile”.
 
If you register for an IDEO Network Account using Facebook or Google the following information, if it has been made publicly available by you, will be stored on our servers as your login information: Facebook or Google ID, first and last name, email address, country, profile photo, geo-location, gender and date of birth. Additionally, your Facebook, or Google Profile Picture becomes part of your login Information but is not stored by us. Your use of information by Facebook or Google in this context will be set out more fully in their privacy policies and in accordance with the settings you choose using their sites. 
Deletion of Your IDEO Network Account: If you wish to delete your Personal Information from the IDEO Network, please contact privacynotice@ideo.com. 
OI Engine & Shape

The OI Platform is the underlying software which powers OpenIDEO and The Teacher’s Guild. The OI Platform and Shape are also used by our Clients’ organizations to leverage their internal or limited access communities (“Private Platforms”). While the use of your Personal Information for OpenIDEO, the Teacher’s Guild and OIEngine.com (such as to send you newsletters) is as stated in this Privacy Policy, if you are a User of the Private Platforms, the use of your Personal Information will depend on the individual consent obtained from individual Users in relation to the Private Platforms, including the terms of use, applicable challenge rules, our agreements with our Clients (who in many cases will be the employer of our Users) and the authority given from them to IDEO, and our Clients’ (and their subcontractors’) use of User information.
