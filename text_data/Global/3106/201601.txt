                    industry-standard firewalls. When you send personal information to Venus over the
                    Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure
                    safe transmission.
                    

                    To verify the security of our site, look at our URL in your browser window. The
                    letter "s" added to the "http" indicates that SSL is in effect. If you are using
                    Netscape Navigator 3.0 or earlier, the broken key symbol in the lower-left corner
                    of the browser window becomes solid when you are in secure mode. In Netscape Communicator
                    4.0 and 4.5, the open padlock symbol in the corner changes to closed in secure mode.
                    In Internet Explorer 4.0, a closed padlock appears in the corner when you are in
                    secure mode. Also, in many cases, your browser will warn you if you are about to
                    send information via a site that is not secure.
