                    Children’s Privacy 
                

                    Venus does not knowingly collect information provided by children under the age of 13.  If 
                    that policy changes, Venus will obtain consent from a parent or guardian before Venus 
                    knowingly collects data from anyone under the age of 13. 
                    



                    Information collected about you
