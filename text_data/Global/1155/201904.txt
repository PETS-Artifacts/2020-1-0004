We work closely with other companies within our group of companies to provide our website Fnatic.com (the “Site”) and any reference to “Us”, “We” or “Our” within this Privacy Policy includes Fnatic Limited and any parent companies, direct or indirect subsidiary companies or other related undertakings within the Fnatic group of companies wherever located in the world as may exist from time to time. We respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting your personal information as that term is defined in the Act (“Information”). We comply with the principles of the Act and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of your Information.
Our Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) is designed to help you understand how we collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Service. For purposes of this Agreement, “Service” refers to the Site’s service. “You” refers to you, as a user of the Service. By using the Site, you consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your name, address, phone number and email address, which you submit to us through the registration process at the Site.
INFORMATION COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY
To activate the Service you may need to submit Personal Information including your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you do not need to submit further Personal Information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”), which may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web pages you visited that had certain Site features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used the Site, and cookie data. 
Depending on how you access the Service, we may track information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Site settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit the Site. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Site account (including personal information about you, such as the email address you gave us), and other cookies are not. 
The Site may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser. Cookies may also be used for the purpose of advertising the Service on third party websites through a technique known as ‘Retargeting’ or ‘Remarketing’ - cookies used for the purpose of advertising contain only Non-Personal Information. 
When you visit the Site, our third party advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser, which may be used to target relevant advertisements to you when you visit third party websites. You can opt out of receiving targeted advertising and review your options by visiting the following link(s):
