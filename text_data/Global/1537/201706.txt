Travel Companion Information.
When you make a reservation for someone else through Expedia.co.uk, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual.

How we use your information

We use credit card information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with travel confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you by email or post about special offers and travel-related products and services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customise your experience with Expedia.co.uk; to reward you as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to join; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection.


Email Communications.
We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a flight to New York on our website and have saved your itinerary or otherwise not yet booked your travel, we may send you an email message reminding you about your saved travel itinerary or about a special airfare to New York. Similarly, if you receive an email from us about New York travel and demonstrate an interest in New York hotels by affirmatively clicking on a link about New York hotels in the email, you may receive an email about New York hotel offers or other destination information. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers available through our sites. Please note that you will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.

Cookies and other Web technologies

For information about our use of cookies or similar technologies, please see our Cookie Policy




Display of tailored advertising/Your choices

Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising.
The advertisements you see on this website are served by us or by our service providers. But we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through
cookies and other technologies.
These third parties include (1) other Expedia Group companies; (2) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (3) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests. We do not permit these third parties to collect personal information about you (such as email address) on our site, nor do we share with them any personal information about you.


Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click
here and here.


Data collected by companies that operate cookie-based exchanges to serve you with relevant advertising. Like other companies operating online, this site participates in cookie-based exchanges where anonymous information is collected about your browsing behavior through
cookies and other technologies
and segmented into different topics of interest (such as travel). These topics of interest are then shared with third parties, including advertisers and ad networks, so they can tailor advertisements to your apparent interests. We do not share personal information (such as your email address) with these companies and we do not permit these companies to collect any such information about you on our site. Please click
here
to learn more about cookie-based exchanges, including how to access information about the topics of interest associated with cookies on your computer and how to decline participation in these programs.




How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using Expedia.co.uk to make hotel and travel bookings, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. While no website can guarantee security, we have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting personal information that is sensitive to you (e.g., credit card details) between your system and ours, and we employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information.




External links and social plug-ins

If any part of the Expedia.co.uk website links you to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.


This may also be the case when any part of the Expedia.co.uk website uses social plug-ins from other sites such as Facebook. Plug-ins such as Facebook's "Like" button, "Comments" and "Facebook Connect", can be identified by one of Facebook's logos, such as the "f" or "thumbs-up" icon, and in practice are like a little piece of Facebook embedded on the Expedia.co.uk website. (The list of Facebook social plug-ins and their icons can be found
here.)
We also offer the option to register with our website via the "Facebook Connect" Plug-in, which allows registered users of Facebook to register with our website by using their Facebook account data without entering the required data manually on our webpage. Instead, your email address and Facebook ID will be transferred from Facebook to us and stored by us.
When you land on any web page that uses these plug-ins, your browser sends certain information to Facebook. As with other sites that use these plug-ins, Expedia does not control this data exchange. To learn more about the information that Facebook receives when you visit a web page with one of their plug-ins, we recommend that you visit Facebook's
help center page.

The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries that your data may be transferred to might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that we take steps to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Policy.




Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy in the future. We will notify you about material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending a notice to the email address you provided to us or by placing a prominent notice on our website.
