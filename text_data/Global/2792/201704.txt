Digi-Key may use both session and persistent cookies on our own or through our third-party service providers as described below. Cookies may save your preferences while you are at the Web Site, such as allowing for persistent login on pages that require logging in, and Digi-Key may use them to provide you with tailored information and tracking as you use the Web Site services. Cookies help Digi-Key, among other things, to determine which areas of the Web Site are popular by tracking hits to those areas, which may in turn allow Digi-Key or our third-party providers to provide you with targeted information or advertising regarding Digi-Key’s products and services.
