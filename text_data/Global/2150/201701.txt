Privacy Policy 
Visa Bureau is not affiliated with the Australian Government but is an independent UK company. Australian visas are available from the Australian Government at a lower cost or for free when you apply directly. Our comprehensive visa and immigration services include immigration advice from registered migration agents, an exceptional success rate, document checking and visa processing.
This Policy is devised to help you feel more confident about the privacy and security of your personal details. We collect and process personal data only in strict compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and associated legislation. 

1. Information Gathered

Visa Bureau collect personal information from Online Visa Assessments, email and SMS alerts and data capture forms on our website. Cookies are used when entering our site to record the location from where each visitor arrived. These records are used for tracking visitors who come from our affiliate sites and other pre-defined web sources. Each web page access is recorded in a log file. The contents of the log file are analysed each month to determine how many visitors Visa Bureau serve, what pages they look at most, and from where they connect. This information is not shared with anyone outside our organisation. 



2. Use of Personal information 


Visa Bureau uses your personal information to assess your suitability for different visa classes and your data to tailor our service to match your needs. Visa Bureau may also use personal information collected to conduct market research, to determine site usage, to run competitions and for direct marketing purposes relating to our business. Visa Bureau may pass your data to limited selected third parties but we will advise you when we do and will provide a mechanism for you to remove or delete your data from our systems.


By completing the Online Assessment you consent to being contacted by Visa Bureau in the future for marketing purposes only. This may include e-mail, contact by means of a telephone call, by post, text messaging or any other format. 


Visa Bureau has legal obligations, under the Data Protection Act 1998, to collect any personal information that you provide to us fairly. Visa Bureau will hold your personal information securely. Manual destruction of files, records and computer print-outs containing sensitive data are carried out in a secure way by either internally shredding or using a supplier who uses secure disposal methods. 


Due to privacy laws, Visa Bureau are unable to discuss your personal details with any third party enquiring on your behalf (including family) unless you provide your consent authorising us to do so.
