As with most modern organizations, The Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, uses computers 
to run our business. Under some circumstances, some of our computer systems may 
hold information about individuals. This document describes the ways in which this 
information is collected, what we do with it, and what you can do about it. This 
privacy policy covers the information that we hold on our website, and on the 
systems that support our web site.

Information We Collect
You can access our Web site home page and browse our site without disclosing your personal data.
We collect the personal data that you may volunteer while using our services. We do not collect information about our visitors from other sources, such as public records or bodies, or private organizations.
You may choose to register yourself, giving us your e-mail address to enable us to identify you. You may optionally elect to have us send you email using that address. This email falls into two categories. One is information on orders (for example, telling you that a download is available, or sending you a receipt. The second category is informational, low volume marketing information—in particular we send out a weekly newsletter, and very occasionally send out information  about sales. You may opt in to one or both of these email options.
In order to purchase things at our online store, you will need to give us certain personal information (name, e-mail address, telephone number, address(s), credit card type, number, expiration, and CVV2 value). We store your contact information in our order entry system. We do not store your credit card details. In fact, your credit card information never passes through our site—it is captured directly by our payment gateway.
Automatic Collection of Information
We do not automatically log personal data nor do we link information automatically logged by other means with personal data about specific individuals. (That is: the only personal data we collect about you is the stuff that you give us). We do not use cookies to store personal data nor do we link non-personal information stored in cookies with personal data about specific individuals. Our online store does use cookies to record session information, which allows you to leave the store and come back later to find your existing shopping cart.
Our Site and Children
We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. We do not take specific steps to protect the privacy of children who disclose their personal data to us. We ask users to confirm that they are at least 18 years old before creating accounts with us.
Passing Data to Third Parties
Our shopping cart system passes the contact and order information to our payment processor at the time you make an order. It passes a small subset of this information a second time at the point where we ship your order (as your credit card only gets billed at the time shipment is made). It also passes your contact details to our shipping agent if you order a physical product.
We have a close relationship with The Pragmatic Studio, who prepare content and courses under our Pragmatic brand. We share information with them.
We will not disclose your information to any other third parties.
Analytics
We use Google Analytics to measure the use of our site. As part of this, we use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. This does not give us specific information about you—we see aggregated data. However, you can opt out using Google’s Ads Settings.
Our intent is to use this information to tune the way we organize our site and the information it contains.
Confidentiality and Security
The screens in our shopping cart which collect personal information use SSL encryption and the https protocol. Do not enter information at our site unless your browser indicates that the page you are using is secure. Our shopping cart software uses an SSL encrypted link, along with other security measures, when transmitting your personal information to our payment processor.
We have implemented security policies, rules and technical measures to protect the personal data that have under our control from:

unauthorised access
improper use or disclosure
unauthorised modification

All the people working for The Pragmatic Programmers, LLC, along with the data processors who have access to, and are associated with the processing of personal data, are obliged to respect the confidentiality of our visitors’ personal data.
We ensure that your personal data will not be disclosed to State institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation.
Access to the personal data we may hold about you
You can ask us whether we are keeping personal data about you. To do this, send a fax to +1 214 206 9982 containing information that we can use to identify you, along with a copy of an officially issued identity document (such as a driving license or passport). The latter requirement may seem like overkill, but we don’t want to give your information out to someone who isn’t you. Please be sure to include sufficient contact details to allow us to respond to you, including an e-mail address and telephone and/or fax number.
We will provide you with a readable copy of the personal data which we keep about you within a week.
We’ll happily update or completely remove any data we hold on you, although we might have to defer any update or deletion if there is a pending credit card transaction based on your data. If however you are disputing a credit card transaction based on your data, them we’ll take steps to deal with it immediately. (Basically, if you want us to remove your from our order-processing system, we’re happy to do it, but we may need your details for a day or two while the order itself is processed. If instead you’re telling us that an order apparently placed by you was not placed by you, we’ll take steps immediately, and not wait for any transaction to complete).
Privacy Compliance
We want to make our privacy policy compliant with national and international schemes where applicable. Please help us by informing us of any such policies that apply to us.
