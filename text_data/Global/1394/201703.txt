Privacy policy for EveKnows.com
Last updated September 24, 2014.
We take your privacy seriously. This privacy statement explains the information about you that we collect and how we use it. In a nutshell: we use it to improve our search results, and we don't share it with anyone.
Personal information collection
We collect information about your use of the EveKnows.com website, including which pages you visit and which links you click on. We use randomly generated unique identifiers to track each visitor, so we do not have a record of all searches that have been made from your computer's IP address. However, our web server does log each visitor's IP address; these logs are regularly deleted after seven days.
EveKnows.com does not collect anything more identifying than your computer's IP address; we do not collect names or contact information.
We use third-party services for website analytics (Google) and advertising (ExoClick). These companies may separately collect information about you, but EveKnows.com does not share data with them.
Using personal information
We use the record of pages you have visited at EveKnows.com to improve our search results and identify problems with the website. We do not sell or otherwise share this information in any way, unless required to do so by law.
