YOUR PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT 
Your privacy is important to us and Crown Melbourne Limited (Crown) is dedicated to protecting your personal information across all areas of its business. Personal information is information or an opinion about you.  

This Privacy Policy explains Crown’s personal information handling practices across the organisation including information about how we collect, use, disclose and store your personal information. 

It also contains information about how you can access the personal information Crown holds about you, how you can ask Crown to correct your personal information and how you can make a complaint if you have concerns about how Crown managed your personal information. 

You can find more information by contacting Crown (please refer to the “How to Contact Crown” section of this policy).  

COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
Crown collects your personal information so that we can perform our functions or activities and offer our services to you. Crown’s functions, activities and services are many and varied and include the casino, the Crown Rewards loyalty program, hotels, restaurants and bars, entertainment, retail, marketing, competitions, financial transactions, complaint handling, recruitment and security and surveillance. 

Personal information includes things such as your name, image, date of birth, phone number(s), postal address and email address. The type of personal information we collect from you depends on your interaction with us.   

Depending on the transaction, if Crown does not collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you an offer or service. 

Collection from you
It is Crown’s usual practice to collect your personal information directly from you. For example, you provide us your personal information when you stay at a Crown hotel, join Crown Rewards, enter a competition, write to us, join a mailing list or make a restaurant reservation. 
 
Collection from public sources or third parties
Where relevant, Crown will collect personal information about you from a publicly available source (such as other websites) or from third parties, for example: 
•    credit reporting bodies (if we request information about your credit history);
•    other casinos; and
•    Crown’s related entities.

Collecting sensitive personal information
Sensitive personal information is information or an opinion about an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions or memberships, religious beliefs or affiliations, philosophical beliefs, sexual preferences, criminal record, health information, genetic information or membership of a trade union. 
Crown’s general approach is not to collect, use or disclose sensitive information. However in limited circumstances, Crown will collect sensitive information where it is necessary for one of Crown’s functions or activities and you have consented to the collection of that information. For example, Crown will collect health information from you before performing a massage at Crown Spa.   

Collecting information required by law 
Crown also collects your personal information where we are required or authorised to do so by an Australian law or court or tribunal order, for example, pursuant to the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (Cth).

USING AND DISCLOSING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Your personal information is held on Crown premises and systems or offsite using trusted third party providers.  Our employees and service providers are required to maintain the confidentiality of any personal information held by Crown.
Our security safeguards include:
•    staff training on their obligations with regard to your information;
•    ensuring appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place when we disclose information overseas or use third parties to handle or store data;
•    system security such as encryption, firewalls and intrusion detection systems and surveillance;
•    complex security such as CCTV and audio surveillance and our security and surveillance staff; and
•    destroying personal information when no longer required.
