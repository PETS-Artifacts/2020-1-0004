Last Updated March 1, 2011http://www.MomsTeam.com/("MomsTeam") has created this privacy policy (the "Policy ") so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to your use of our Web site ("Site") located at http://www.MomsTeam.com. By using the Site or the services available through the Site (the "Service"), you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy. This Site is owned and operated by MomsTeam.com, Inc. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the "last updated" date set forth above. Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the Service to see if it has been updated since your last visit. For information on our privacy policy regarding children under the age of 13, please refer to our Kids Privacy Policy.INFORMATION ABOUT YOU We collect two basic types of information with our Service, namely personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term "personal information" means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a first and last name, address, telephone number, mobile number, e-mail address, or other account number), and demographic and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. Our definition of personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our Service may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Service, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Service. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our Service, and for advertising and marketing purposes. Those are the types of personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:Information You Give Us. We collect information you give us at various times when you register with us and use our Service. Examples include the following:Registration and Transaction Information. When you register to use the Service, we may collect various kinds of contact information about you including, for example, your name, e-mail address, birth date, country of residence, and zip code. We may also collect demographic information that you provide to us. You will also be asked to create a user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing the Service. Finally, you will be asked to choose a secret question and answer for purposes of password retrieval.Use of Services and Interactive Areas of Site. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with participating in interactive areas on the Site or using the Service. For example, you may submit for posting on the Site images that could reasonably be used to identify you, and written statements and descriptions that could be used to identify you. Several categories of this information are optional, and you will have the ability to edit or remove much of this information at any given time.Submissions and Customer Service. From time-to-time we may post surveys, contests or sweepstakes on our Service, which may request personal or demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information. We may also collect personal information if you provide it via e-mail, message boards, or other interactive services. Please do not post any information that you expect to keep private. In addition, we may collect and retain information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions.Automatically Collected Information. We automatically receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the Service, our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of operating system or browser you use. We may also collect information pertaining to your account activity, information pertaining to the files accessed or used by you, transactional information, and standard access information, such as the time and date of accessing the Service, and usage of the Service. We use such information to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about Service usage. We may also correlate this information with personal information through the use of back-end analytical tools.Cookies. We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other things, the use of cookies enables us to improve our Site by seeing which areas and features are most popular; to count the number of computers accessing the Site; to personalize the Site and improve the Site experience; to record your preferences and track the ads you view; to track your transactional information; and to allow you to visit the Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a Web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and the Service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or services.Web beacons. "Web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, 1-by-1 GIFs, and Web bugs) are tiny graphic files placed on a Web page which send a signal when a user has visited that page, allowing the site to collect standard access information, such as time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. We use Web beacons to help manage the effectiveness of our online advertising and to gather access information, such as counting the users who have visited those pages and compiling aggregated statistics about site usage.Information about Children Under 13.

MomsTeam generates automatic backups of all system data. These backups are transferred using commercially reasonable efforts such as secure technology, and are stored on systems that are only accessible by authorized employees of MomsTeam and our third-party vendors and partners.

We have implemented softwae and hardware security, including firewalls, data encryption, and private networks intended to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access. We use firewalls and intrusion-detection devices that are designed to defend against hackers and notify us if any attempts are made to compromise our network. We regularly review additional software upgrades to enhance our security measures. However, despite our efforts, no system can completely guaranty that there will never be unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information, and your use of the Site indicates that you are willing to assume this risk.If MomsTeam learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps.
