The Data We Collect:
When you create a Zygor Account we collect and store the following information.
On our local server we collect and store:
Your username, first and last name, and email address. Passwords are not stored and are encrypted in a way that can only be used for login purposes and thus cannot be retrieved in the event of a security breach.
If you choose to link your social media and/or discord accounts (completely optional) we are able to access select profile information through those third party services. You will be shown what info we will gain access to and be asked for approval before any accounts are linked.
Almost all user interactivity on the site is handled via cookies stored locally on each users device. Additionally, we track user behavior and interaction using Google and Facebook tracking pixels.
If you purchase a Zygor Elite subscription our payment processor Recurly collects and stores:
Your Payment info and your billing address. If you use Paypal only a "token" is stored rather than your full info. This information is not stored locally on our servers but externally on Recurly's servers. Recurly is GDPR complaint as of May 25th.
Additionally, when you sign up for an account your email is automatically added to our Aweber (third party mailing list service) newsletter.
