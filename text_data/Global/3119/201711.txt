Visitors to our digital channels and how we use cookies
When you visit www.nhm.ac.uk we collect standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the site, to compile statistical reports on website activity and to personalise our visitors’ experiences of using the site.
Cookies are text files placed on your computer to collect this information. You can set your browser not to accept cookies and remove cookies from your browser. However in a few cases some of our website features may not function as a result. You can read more about how we use cookies and how to disable cookies on our Information about cookies page.
If we do want to collect personally identifiable information via the website or other digital channels, we will be up front about this. We will make it clear when we collect personal information and will explain what we intend to do with it.
This privacy notice does not cover links to external websites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on the other websites you visit.
Devices detected by our free Wi-Fi service
Free Wi-Fi access is available throughout the Museum via the NHM-free-wifi network. If you access the Museum’s free Wi-Fi network, you will be asked to agree to the Museum’s Wi-Fi terms and conditions of use, which provide information about how your data will be used.
If you do not use the free Wi-Fi network but you have Wi-Fi enabled on your smartphone, tablet or another internet-enabled device, your device can still be detected by the Wi-Fi service. We record data about the location and type of devices in the Museum that have Wi-Fi enabled so that we can monitor the flow of visitors around the Museum, and to improve our services.
We will not link the anonymous device data with any other personal data that identifies you individually without your express permission. If in future we want to process your data in this way to offer you new services, before doing so we will always ask you if you agree to take part.
People who use and support our services
The main purposes for which we collect and process the details of customers, visitors, members, service users, enquirers, donors and potential donors are:

to provide the service, goods or information that they have requested
for administration purposes e.g. to administer donations
to further our charitable aims, including fundraising activities
to gather feedback 

We may also hold and analyse your data in order to continue to improve our understanding of our target audiences and of our supporters. This is with a view to providing world class, transformative, visitor-focused experiences, customer service and educational engagement, and to look at ways in which we might in the future use the latest technologies to improve and personalise the services that we offer. As part of this, we may analyse personal information collected from you, and occasionally from third parties, to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information.
We may use your data to contact you from time to time by post, email, phone and/or SMS with news and information about the Museum that we feel may be of interest to you, such as research, education and fundraising, and about our other events, activities, products and services. We will not use your personal information for such marketing purposes if you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted.
When you subscribe to our services or give consent to receiving news and information from us, you can cancel your subscription, withdraw your consent to being contacted or change your preferred method of contact at any time by emailing unsubscribe@nhm.ac.uk. Subscribing for email newsletters and other marketing communications is optional. You do not need to subscribe to marketing from us when you buy products, book tickets, donate or use any other of our services.
We will not share personal data with third party organisations for marketing purposes, but may occasionally outsource functions when we do not have the in-house capacity required, such as the use of a mailing house for mailings, and analytical services that enable us to target our communications with customers and supporters more effectively. In such cases we will only use reputable and well vetted firms and have contracts and processes in place that ensure the safe and confidential processing of personal data at all times. We may also disclose personal information where required or otherwise permitted by law. We will always ensure an adequate level of protection is provided for personal information transferred outside the European Economic Area.
We occasionally share data with the Natural History Development Trust, a dedicated independent fundraising trust, and The International Friends of the Natural History Museum, a foundation run by a board of trustees and a registered 501(c)3 organisation encouraging tax-deductible gifts under US law. These organisations are subject to strict agreements with the Museum that ensure that they meet the highest standards when collecting and using personal data.
Job and volunteering applicants
If you apply to work or volunteer at the Museum, we will use the information you supply to us to process your application and to monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose information to a third party, for example where we want to take up a reference or obtain a ‘disclosure’ from Disclosure Scotland or the Disclosure and Barring Service, we will not do so without informing you beforehand.
Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, after which it will be destroyed, unless you have asked us to destroy it earlier or allowed us to retain it for longer by written request. 
Access to personal information and correction
We strive at all times to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. You may ask us to correct or remove information that you think is inaccurate by contacting us as detailed below in the How to contact us section. If your personal details change, please help us to keep your information up to date by notifying us at the address below.
