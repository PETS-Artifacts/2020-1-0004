The American Geophysical Union (AGU) is committed to safeguarding our members’ privacy and safety. In early 2015, the AGU Privacy Policy Task Force – which drew upon the talents and expertise of a diverse cross section of AGU’s membership – began working in concert with internal AGU staff and expert advisors to update the Master Privacy Policy, and to create Privacy Guidelines-Principles and Practices. The goal was to provide clear direction for AGU’s data collection efforts “including (the acquisition of) personally identifiable information, and how AGU may use, process, and share such information.” These two documents are the result of this rigorous and collaborative effort. As such, they are “living documents” that will be periodically updated as needs and concerns demand. If you have any questions or comments about the information herein, please contact service@agu.org.
