		What information is collected?

		Nintendo will only collect Personal Information from our online visitors to the website for (1) contest registration; (2) newsletter registration; (3) surveys; (4) registration for games or special game-specific promotion participation; (5) and to enable you to join specific groups such as Club Nintendo. Personal Information collected may include your name, nickname, e-mail address, mobile phone number and birth date. We do not generally require this information to allow access to this website; however, there may be some areas of the site that you will not be able to access unless you register. For example, "Members Only" areas will require you to register before you can access them.

		Nintendo also may collect demographic information from visitors, such as age, gender, geographic location, game genre interests, what platforms you own and stores you usually purchase Nintendo products from. This information helps us improve our online offerings and allows us to tailor information to your preferences.

We see this as a value-added service helping you to find useful products or services. We strive to limit use of the information you provide to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving.  You may opt out if you do not wish to receive such material.

		We may use your Personal Information for internal demographic studies, so we can improve our websites and products to better meet our visitors' needs. In some cases, we may merge your Personal Information with data collected from other sources.
