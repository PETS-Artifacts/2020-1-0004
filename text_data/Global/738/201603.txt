‘We’ are Virgin Holidays, a member of the Virgin Holidays Family, which includes Virgin Holidays, Virgin Holidays Cruises, Virgin Holidays & Worldwide Journeys, Virgin Holidays Platinum Hotels, Travel City Direct and Bales Worldwide.
In order to process your booking  and to ensure that your travel arrangements run smoothly and meet your  requirements we need to use the information you provide such as name, address,  any special needs/dietary requirements etc. We take full responsibility for  ensuring that proper security measures are in place to protect your  information. We must pass the information on to the relevant suppliers of your  travel arrangements such as airlines, hotels, transport companies etc. The  information may also be provided to security or credit checking companies, public  authorities such as customs/immigration if required by them, or as required by  law. Additionally, where your holiday is outside the European Economic Area  (EEA), controls on data protection in your destination may not be as strong as  the legal requirements in this country.
We may use your information for  the purposes set out in our data protection notification with the Office of the  Information Commissioner. We may disclose the same to companies in the Virgin  group for business purposes and to companies who act as data processors on our  behalf. Some of your information may be 'sensitive personal data' such as  details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements. (If we cannot  pass this information to the relevant suppliers, whether in the EEA or not, we  cannot provide your booking). In making this booking, you consent to this  information being passed on to the relevant persons. You are responsible for  ensuring that other members of your party are aware of our privacy policy.
Telephone calls made to and from our Contact Centres may be recorded and monitored for the purpose of quality assurance, training, security and for business purposes.

We would like to hold your  information (including any email address), where collected by us, for our own  future marketing purposes (for example to inform you of promotional/competition  offers, to help recognise and service a potential booking on our website or to send you our brochure). 
 If you have given us, the Virgin Holidays Group, your consent, from time to time we may contact you by post, phone, e-mail or electronic messaging services with information about products and services (including discounts and special offers) we think will be of interest to you.

We may also send you such information about other companies' products and services (such as other members of the Virgin Holidays Family or other Virgin companies), that may be of interest to you.
