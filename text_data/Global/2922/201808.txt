                        EatStreet does not direct or target any piece of our Sites or services to children under
                        the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information other
                        than an email address, please contact us at customer.service@EatStreet.com. We will make
                        reasonable efforts to remove such information from our databases.
                    

Consent; Changes; Applicability:


                        By browsing and/or using our Sites, you agree to all of the terms and conditions of this
                        Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. If you do not agree with this privacy policy, please
                        do not use our Sites or disclose any personal information to EatStreet.
                    

                        Notice of special offers is from time to time provided to our users. If users do not want to
                        receive notices of special offers, you must send an email to customer.service@eatstreet.com,
                        and write "cancellation of special offers" in the subject.
                    

                        Because the methods used to protect your private information and the services we provide are
                        continually evolving, our privacy policy may change at any time. Unless otherwise noted,
                        those changes will be effective as soon as they are posted. If changes are made to our
                        privacy policy, we will make it known on EatStreet or by email. By continuing to use our Sites
                        after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
                        We recommend that users look at the privacy policy from time to time to review such changes.
                    

                        Except as indicated above, this privacy policy applies only to EatStreet, not to any
                        advertisers, vendors, or third parties that are shown or linked with EatStreet. If you
                        provide personal information to these third parties, you are doing so at your own risk.
