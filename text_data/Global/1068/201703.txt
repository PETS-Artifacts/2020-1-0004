GOVERNMENT OF SINGAPORE PRIVACY STATEMENT

This is a Government of Singapore website.
We may use "cookies", where a small data file is sent to your
        browser to store and track information about you when you enter our
        websites. The cookie is used to track information such as the number of
        users and their frequency of use, profiles of users and their preferred
        sites. While this cookie can tell us when you enter our sites and which
        pages you visit, it cannot read data off your hard disk.
You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers
        automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
        setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from
        taking full advantage of the website.
If you provide us with personally identifiable data:

            
We may share necessary data with other Government agencies,

                unless such sharing is prohibited by law.
We will NOT share your personal data with non-Government
                entities, except where such entities have been authorised to
                carry out specific Government services.
For your convenience, we may also display to you data you
                had previously supplied us or other Government Agencies. This
                will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of
                repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date,
                please supply us the latest data.


To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and
        transmission of personal data is secured with appropriate security
        technologies.
This site may contain links to non-Government sites whose data
        protection and privacy practices may differ from ours. We are not
        responsible for the content and privacy practices of these other
        websites and encourage you to consult the privacy notices of those
        sites.
Please contact gov.sg Webmaster if
        you:

                policies and procedures,
need more information on or access to data which you have
                provided to us in the past.
