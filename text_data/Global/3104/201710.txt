We may collect information about your interaction with the Websites. For example, we may use website analytic tools on the Websites to retrieve information such as the site you came from or the keywords you used to find the Websites. We will also use technologies, such as cookies and pixel-based tracking, to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click on and other actions you take on the Websites.

This information will sometimes be used to display content to you on our Websites or Social Media Sites.

How Does Best Friends Secure My Information?
Best Friends provides Website visitors with a secure experience when making a donation or purchasing merchandise through our Websites. We work with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliant vendors.  When personal information is transmitted, it is protected through the use of industry-standard security technology, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Even with these measures in place, users should use special caution when using publicly accessible computer terminals or transmitting personal information over unsecured wireless networks.
In addition, on certain Website pages like blogs and news stories, we offer visitors the opportunity to provide comments or other user-generated content.  Any information that you disclose when posting a message to these areas, along with the screen name or ID used, becomes public. We are not responsible for any personally identifiable information that you choose to disclose in the public areas of our Websites or Social Media Sites.
Donor Privacy:  Best Friends does not sell, rent, or exchange its donor list for direct mailing purposes. Its Board of Directors adopted a policy prohibiting the sale, rental, or exchange of its donor list. This Privacy Policy outlines how donor information is used.
How Does Best Friends Use My Personal Information?
Best Friends collects and uses your personal information to circulate news about Best Friends and its programs, to promote events, to acquire new members and subscribers, to operate the Best Friends Websites, and for other internal marketing, promotional, and fundraising purposes.
Network Partners: Best Friends operates the Best Friends Network, a network of 501(c)(3) public charity animal welfare groups and government shelters (“Network Partners”) committed to saving the lives of homeless pets. Best Friends may share personally identifiable information with Network Partners for whom you elect to raise money at events like the yearly Strut Your Mutt fundraiser. While any data you provide when registering or participating in an event like Strut Your Mutt will be used by Best Friends and housed in the Best Friends database, we will not share your information with any other Network Partners that you have not elected to raise funds for. If you have concerns and do not wish to receive communications from your selected Network Partners, please contact us before registering for the event by sending an email to privacy@bestfriends.org.
Corporate Partners:  Best Friends may, from time to time, share personally identifiable information, including email and home addresses, with carefully selected corporate partners to provide the programs, products or services for which we contracted. These corporate partners are required to protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any other purpose. If you do not wish to receive communications from those partners by email, you may change your email preferences here.  To opt-out of mail and emailed offers, you may opt-out by sending an email to privacy@bestfriends.org. Keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies only to our communications channels; if you independently provide information to a third party, you will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy.
Outside Contractors:  Best Friends may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers (collectively, "Outside Contractors") to provide specific services and products such as to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, process donations or send email or other messages on your behalf (such as issue advocacy emails to legislators).
Access to your personally identifiable information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and not use or disclose your personally identifiable information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.
Other:  We may share aggregated demographic information with our funders, such as grant-making organizations and foundations, for the purpose of demonstrating that we are meeting our organization goals.
Best Friends may release personal information if we believe that the law or legal process served on Best Friends requires it, to protect and defend the rights or property of Best Friends, or in an emergency, to protect the personal safety of an identifiable visitor or the public.
