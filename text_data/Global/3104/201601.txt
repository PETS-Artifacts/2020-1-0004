Is my personal information secure?
We provide Website visitors with a secure experience when making a donation or purchasing merchandise through our Websites. When personal information is transmitted by Best Friends to other websites, it is protected through the use of industry-standard security technology, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. To further enhance security, stored donation and order information is also encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to the data.
Although we use industry-standard safeguards to secure the privacy of your personal information, transmissions made via the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Users should use special caution when using publicly accessible computer terminals or transmitting personal information over unsecured wireless networks.

How does Best Friends use cookies?
The Best Friends website uses "cookies" to ensure the integrity of the registration process and to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
No personal information is ever stored in a Best Friends cookie even if you have entered your name or email address on other parts of the Websites.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The cookie tells the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Best Friends pages, or register with a Best Friends website or services, a cookie helps Best Friends recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Best Friends website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Best Friends features that you customized.
To protect our visitors, cookies do not save payment or credit card information. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Best Friends services or Websites you visit.
How does Best Friends use Web beacons?
Best Friends Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel GIFs), which may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver services. We may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.
Best Friends may also employ Web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information.
How can I comment on the Best Friends Privacy Policy?
Best Friends welcomes your comments regarding this Website Privacy Policy. If you believe that Best Friends has not adhered to this policy, please contact Best Friends at privacy@bestfriends.org. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.
