Overview
The Board of Trustees of Northern Illinois University ("NIU," or "University") respects the privacy of every individual who visits the NIU website. This privacy notice outlines the information the NIU website may collect and how that information may be processed.
The NIU website is supported by many University web servers. Some servers or sites hosted by Northern Illinois University may adopt different privacy notices that go beyond the parameters set forth in this document, as their specific needs require. However, those servers or sites cannot adopt privacy policies or practices that in any way supersede federal or state laws or regulations, NIU Board of Trustees Bylaws and Regulations, and/or this policy. Any discrepancy between the information presented here and the official Bylaws and Regulations of the Board of Trustees of Northern Illinois University and the policies and procedures of Northern Illinois University is not intended to and does not alter or amend the official Bylaws, Regulations, policies or procedures. NIU reserves the right to alter this policy at any time and will post future amended documents at this location.
Definitions
The NIU website is defined as publicly accessible pages hosted under the domain "www.niu.edu," any web address ending ".niu.edu," or any website within the NIU IP address range that is maintained by NIU employees or departments or units, acting within their respective scopes of employment.
Questions or Concerns
Anyone with questions or concerns about NIU's policies and procedures regarding the protection of personal data may email the University Privacy Officer at NIUPrivacyOfficer@niuits.onmicrosoft.com. For additional information on privacy rights for NIU community members, please view the NIU Privacy Policy.
Collection and Processing of Supplied Personal Data
Northern Illinois University uses the University Web for business purposes and is committed to fostering and protecting the privacy of personal data.
Voluntary Consent
The NIU website will not collect personally identifiable information (personal data) about persons, such as name, address, telephone number, or email address unless the information was provided with voluntary consent. Persons should not voluntarily provide personal data if they do not want it to be collected.
Without Voluntary Consent
In some cases, information that is not personally identifiable may be automatically collected and/or logged. For example, information about the visitor's browser, operating system, IP address, and the domain name of sites that are linked to the NIU website serves the legitimate interest of NIU and the needs of the majority of users by:

personalizing the user experience; or
assisting with troubleshooting and diagnoses if there are problems with servers; or
producing important statistics on how often pages are visited; or
detecting security breaches and safeguarding NIU's computing resources.

Permitted Uses
When collected, personal data may be used:

to fulfill an order or request; or
to assist with better understanding the needs of visitors, thereby allowing NIU to improve services; or
to reply to or contact users.

NIU will not sell, rent, or market personal data to third parties.
Use of the University Web is subject to all applicable state and federal law, as well as all relevant University and campus policies. It is the University's usual practice not to share any personal information with those outside of the University. However, when circumstances arise for the need to share information gathered from its computing resources within the NIU IP Address space, the University may share as:

Authorized and/or mandated by law; or
Permitted under University policies; or
Authorized by an approved Northern Illinois University contract; or
Clearly stated at a University Web site that such information will be shared and the user actively indicated informed consent by providing the information; or
When consent is otherwise given.

Safeguarding Personal Data
The Division of Information Technology (DoIT) has taken several steps to safeguard the integrity of its communications and computing infrastructure, including but not limited to authentication, monitoring, auditing, and encryption. Security measures have been integrated into the design, implementation and day-to-day practices of the entire University operating environment as part of its continuing commitment to risk management. However, such activities should not be construed as any warranty against the unauthorized breach/failure of these security measures.
Information Placed Automatically on Visitor Computers (Cookies)
When visitors view the NIU website, some information may be stored on their computer in the form of a "cookie" or similar file. Cookie help web authors tailor websites to better match user interests and preferences. With most Internet browsers, users can alter user preferences to erase cookies from their hard drive, block cookies, or have it prompt the user to either accept or refuse to store the cookie. Most browser help files have detailed instructions on how to set user preferences for cookies.
In compliance with the Illinois State Agency Web Site Act, NIU websites will not use permanent cookies or any other invasive tracking programs that monitor and track website viewing habits, unless they meet the following criteria:

The use of permanent cookies adds value to the user otherwise not available;
The permanent cookies are not used to monitor and track website viewing habits unless all types of information collected and the University's use of that information add user value and are disclosed through a comprehensive online privacy statement.

NIU websites may, however, use transactional cookies that facilitate business transactions.
Public Forums, Online Surveys and Other Information Provided by the User
Many units of the University provide chat rooms, forums, message boards, and other online groups for their users. Any information that is disclosed in these areas may become public information and a user should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose one's personal information in such places. Chat sessions and discussion forums may be logged.
In addition, at any time there are numerous online surveys being conducted on NIU websites. Persons responsible for conducting online surveys that collect personally identifiable information (PII) must clearly state at the survey site the extent to which any information provided will be shared or protected. Aggregated and anonymized data from surveys may be shared with external third parties in ways that do not compromise privacy.
Compliance with Relevant Federal and State Information Privacy Laws
Northern Illinois University is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. Accordingly, if a user of the NIU website is under the age of thirteen, such user is not authorized to provide NIU with personally identifying information and the University will not use any such information in its database or other data collection activities. Users under the age of thirteen and their parents or guardians are otherwise cautioned that the collection of personal information volunteered by unauthorized children online or by email will be treated in the same way as information given by an adult until the University becomes aware that the user is under the age of thirteen and such information may be subject to public access.
In addition, Northern Illinois University is committed to complying fully with, among all other applicable federal and state laws:

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which generally prohibits the release of student education records without student permission;
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), which generally safeguards the integrity and confidentiality of health information that is transmitted electronically;

Illinois Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). As a state institution, NIU may be legally required under the Illinois Freedom of Information Act or other laws to provide specific information, such as some electronic correspondence sent via the NIU web site.
