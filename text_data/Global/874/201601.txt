We take data security and the privacy of your personal information very seriously.




Maryland law mandates that State agencies shall not create personal records unless
                           the need for the information is clearly established and that personal records shall
                           be relevant to the purposes for which they are collected, be accurate and current,
                           and not be obtained by fraudulent means.
                        
State officials who request personal data from citizens must notify the citizens regarding
                           the purposes for which the information is collected; consequences to the citizen for
                           refusing to provide the personal information; the citizen's right to inspect and correct
                           personal records; whether the information is generally available for public inspection;
                           and whether the information is made available to other entities. Towson University
