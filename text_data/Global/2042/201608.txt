Welcome to Shopify!
This Privacy Policy was written to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your information.
Since technology and privacy laws are always changing, we may occasionally update this policy.
If a significant change is made, we will be sure to post a notice on our home page and in the merchant admin.
If you continue to use Shopify after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.
By signing up for any of the products or services offered by Shopify (together, the “Services”), or dealing with a merchant
using Shopify Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Shopify Terms of Service.
This policy is a legally binding agreement between you (and your client, employer or another entity if you are
acting on their behalf) as the user of the Services (referred to as “you” or “your”) and Shopify Inc. and its affiliates, including but not limited to Shopify Data Processing Inc. (referred to as “we”, “our”, “us” or “Shopify”).
If we add any new features or tools to our Services, they will also be subject to this policy.
We will keep your Personal Information accurate, complete and up-to-date with the information that you provide to us.
If you request access to your Personal Information, we will inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of your
Personal Information as allowed by law, and provide you access to that information.
When we use the term “Personal Information” in this policy, it means any information related to an identifiable individual,
but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.
This Privacy Policy may be available in languages other than English. To the extent of any inconsistencies or conflicts between this English Privacy Policy and our Privacy Policy available in another language, the most current English version of the Privacy Policy at https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy will prevail.
