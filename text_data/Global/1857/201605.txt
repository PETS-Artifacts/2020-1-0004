                Backblaze Privacy Policy
            Updated 4/5/16 
            Please read this privacy policy carefully. It applies to all interactions you have with Backblaze's web
            services
            and apps.

            Note that Backblaze has two different products:

Computer Backup provides unlimited cloud
                    backup for individuals and organizations using Macs or PCs.
                
B2 Cloud Storage provides low-cost
                    cloud
                    storage for individuals and organizations.
                


            When we collect, store, use, or share information differently among these products, we'll note that
            below.
The Information We Collect
Account Information. When you create a Backblaze account, we ask for your email address and
            a
            password. We may also ask for your phone number for purposes such as two-factor verification and sending you
            service alerts. If you choose to sign up for one of our services, we'll ask you for billing information. If
            you
            order a physical item from us, such as a Restore by Mail, we'll ask for shipping information. At times we
            may
            ask for other information such as your name or your company name.
Your Files. Our Computer Backup service automatically backs up your files to Backblaze; B2
            Cloud Storage allows you to upload your files to our service. Please keep in mind that your files may
            include
            personally identifiable information, both in the contents of a file and in metadata.
Information About Your Use of Backblaze. We receive some information automatically when you
            use
            any Backblaze product. This includes data about your device, software, and the operating system you use when
            accessing our service, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of each request you make to
            Backblaze. When you use our backup services, we'll also receive information such as the names of external
            drives, file types transferred, and number and size of files transferred.
Information We Learn Through Your Interactions with Us. You may choose to provide us with
            personal information when you call us, email us, chat with us, answer a survey, comment on our blog, or
            interact
            with us through other services like Twitter or Facebook. 
Referrals. If you refer a friend to Backblaze, we'll ask you for their email address. You
            can
            also choose to upload your contacts stored with others services such as Google and Yahoo in order to refer
            friends.
Information from Other Sources. We may collect additional information about you from third
            parties to help us figure out how to better serve you.
How We Use Your Information

            We use your personal information to keep Backblaze running, understand how you use our service, customize
            your
            experience, prevent abuse, provide customer support, sell and market our products, and improve Backblaze. We
            use
            your information internally only as needed to accomplish these goals.
How We Disclose Your Information

            We will share your personally identifiable information only in the limited circumstances below. Backblaze
            does
            not sell your information or share it with third-party advertisers.
With your permission. We may share your information with your consent, after letting you
            know
            what information will be shared and with whom.
In response to the law. We may disclose your information if we believe it is reasonably
            necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or valid legal process. If we are going to release your
            information,
            our policy is to provide you with notice unless we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order (e.g.,
            an
            order under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2705(b)). We may disclose your information without providing you with prior notice
            if we
            believe it's necessary to prevent imminent and serious bodily harm to a person. Nothing in this policy is
            intended to limit any legal objections or defenses you might have to demands to compel disclosure of your
            information, including demands from the government.
With third parties helping us provide Backblaze. We may share your information with
            third-party
            services helping us provide and improve our products. Those third parties access and use your information
            only
            on our behalf. They include companies such as Stripe, Salesforce, Google, Freshbooks, Facebook, Twitter,
            MailChimp, Slack, SurveyMonkey, SendGrid, and ZenDesk. Please note that this Privacy Policy explains
            Backblaze's
            practices only, and doesn't extend to the practices of other services. 
With group administrators. If you use our services as part of a business, group, or
            organization where Backblaze was set up by an administrator, the administrator may be able to access and
            control
            your account. Refer to your organization's internal policies for more information. 
With other internet services. If you are a B2 Cloud Storage user, you may give third
            parties
            the ability to access information and content in your account (e.g., through APIs). When other services
            access
            and use your information, their conduct is governed by their own terms and policies.
With other people, in limited circumstances. When you use B2 Cloud Storage, your settings
            give
            you the option to make information and content available to other people. When you refer a friend to us,
            we'll
            share your name and email address with that person. And when you post comments on our blog, of course, other
            people can read them. 
Sale or merger. If all or part of Backblaze is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to
            another company in the future, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. If that
            happens,
            Backblaze will take reasonable steps to make sure your information continues to be treated consistent with
            this
            privacy policy.
Aggregate information. We may disclose aggregate, non-identifying information about how our
            users use Backblaze products.
Web Tracking Policy
Cookies. We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how
            and
            when you use Backblaze products. We use cookies to identify whether you have logged in and recognize that
            your
            web browser has accessed our servers before, and we may associate that information with your account.
            Most browsers have an option for disabling cookies, but if you disable them, some Backblaze services will
            not
            work.
            Some third-party services that we use, such as Google Analytics, may place their own cookies in your
            browser.
            This Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and not the use of cookies by third parties.
Do Not Track. Some browsers make it possible for you to signal that you don't want your
            internet browsing activity to be tracked. There is not yet a consensus in the internet community about how
            to
            best honor these signals, so we don't respond to Do Not Track requests at this time.
Data Security

            Backblaze products are designed to have several layers of security.

 We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/Transport Layer Security (TLS) to create a secure tunnel to
                    protect
                    data in transit between Backblaze apps and servers.
                
 We don't retain your actual account password, but hash and salt it to help protect it against
                    possible
                    compromise.
                
 You have the option to enable two-factor verification, a login feature that adds an extra layer of
                    security to your account.
                
 We narrowly limit the number of Backblaze employees who have access to user data through policy and
                    technical access controls.
                
 For Computer Backup, your files are automatically encrypted by default on your computer before
                    being
                    sent to Backblaze. The encrypted files are sent and stored in encrypted form. By default, Backblaze
                    retains a copy of the encryption key to make data recovery possible if you forget your password.
                    However, you can choose to keep the only copy of the key if you prefer. For B2 Cloud Storage, it is
                    up
                    to you whether you choose to encrypt your files before uploading them.
                



            You use Backblaze at your own risk, and are responsible for taking reasonable measures to secure your
            account
            (such as choosing a strong, unique password and keeping it secret).

            We are always on the lookout for vulnerabilities in Backblaze. If you discover a vulnerability in our
            service,
            we would be grateful for your report and encourage you to let us know immediately. If you give us reasonable
            time to respond to your report before making any information public, and make a good faith effort to avoid
            privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service during your
            research, we
            will not pursue any legal action against you or ask law enforcement to investigate your actions.

            To report a vulnerability, please email security@backblaze.com.
Account Cancelation

            You are free to stop using Backblaze at any time. If you choose to deactivate your account, we'll delete
            your
            backups and files stored in B2 Cloud Storage within a reasonable amount of time. We will continue to keep
            some
            information about your use of our service.
Changes to This Policy

            We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our
            use
            of your information and will always be at
