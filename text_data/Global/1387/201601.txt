Lexington Privacy Policy
Â© Lexington Law Firm

			Your privacy is important to Lexington Law Firm ("Lexington"). Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to understand how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information. By visiting Lexington's website or agreeing to content that includes a link to this document ("Online Ads"), you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
		
Our Collection and Use of Personal Information

			Personal Information is information you provide us that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person, such as your name, email address, phone numbers and tax identification number. 
		

			You may be asked to provide Personal Information when you interact with Lexington, Online Ads, or one of Lexington's related companies, such as in connection with a completed or abandoned transaction or a request for information from Lexington. Lexington and its related companies may share your Personal Information with each other and use it consistent with this Privacy Policy.
		

			Lexington may supplement the Personal Information you provide with Personal Information available from other sources, such as public databases, data aggregators, and other commercially available sources.
		
Examples of Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It

			You may provide Lexington a variety of Personal Information, including your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, payment information, and tax identification number.
		

			The Personal Information we collect allows us to deliver requested products, services and information to you, to stay in contact with you, and to manage Lexington's relationship with you. By providing Lexington with Personal Information, you consent to Lexington's transfer and storage of that information.
		

			Lexington also may use your Personal Information for research, development, and analysis, and for advertising, marketing, product and service offerings, security, fraud prevention, and other business activities. 
		
Our Collection and Use of Non-Personal Information

			Non-Personal Information is information in a form that does not allow for direct association with a specific person. This information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. We may collect, use, monitor, analyze, transfer, and disclose Non-Personal Information for any purpose.
		
Examples of Non-Personal Information We Collect and How We Use It

			We may collect and aggregate information regarding user access, activity and behavior on our website, such as when you visit the website and what content is of interest or seems to be most useful to you. If we combine Non-Personal Information with Personal Information, the combined information is treated as Personal Information for purposes of this Privacy Policy.

			Click-Through URLs - In some email messages, we use a Click-Through URL to link to content on our website. When you click one of these URLs, you pass through a separate web server before reaching our site.
		

			We use Click-Through URLs to help us determine interest in a particular topic and to measure the effectiveness of our email communications.

investigate potential violations of and enforce applicable terms of service


			In the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third-party.

Social Media Plug-ins

			Plug-ins for social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Yahoo, Windows and Google plus (among others), are integrated on Lexington's website.
		

			By interacting with us through a social media plug-in, certain information will be transmitted to the related social network, and you permit us to have on-going access to information from your social network profile.
		

			If you do not want the social network to collect information about you, or to share it with Lexington and other third parties, please review the privacy policy of the relevant social network and/or log out of the relevant social network before you visit Lexington's site.
		
Information Security and Retention

			Lexington takes precautions to safeguard your Personal Information from loss, theft, and misuse, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, alternation, and destruction. These precautions include technical, physical, and managerial procedures.
		

			Because email and instant messaging are not recognized as secure communications, we request that you not send private information to us by email or instant messaging services.
		

			We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy and enforce safeguards within the company.
		

			We are committed to working with appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of Personal Information that we cannot resolve with our customers directly.
		

			Lexington uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all pages where Personal Information is collected. This protects the confidentiality of your Personal Information while it is transmitted over the Internet.
		

			For your own protection, you should exercise care with the information you share over the Internet. You should always use a secure browser and exercise good judgment in using passwords, such as using a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, special characters, and you should avoid using the same or similar passwords across multiple sites.
		

			Clients may access their Personal Information by logging into their account. We make good-faith efforts to give you ways to update or to delete your Personal Information quickly, unless we need to keep that information for a legitimate business or legal purpose. Some changes require personal contact with an assigned Lexington representative.
		

			Lexington retains Personal Information and Non-Personal Information for the time necessary and reasonable to fulfill the purposes outlined in the Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
		

			We may reject requests to change or delete information that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, requiring the development of new systems or fundamental changes to existing systems), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (such as information stored on backups).
		

			We work to protect data from accidental or malicious destruction. Accordingly, we may not immediately delete or change residual copies and we may not delete or change information from our backup systems. Unless a disproportionate effort is required, we will provide information access and correction without charge. 
		
Third Party Privacy Policies

			This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Lexington does not own or control or to people that Lexington does not employ or manage. Lexington does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others. For more information about each such third party, please refer to the third party's privacy policy.
		

			If you provided your information on the website of an entity not related to Lexington, and that entity shared your information with us, the privacy policy of that website governs the non-related entity's use of your information, which may be different from this policy.
		
Children

			We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected the personal information of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete the Personal Information as soon as possible.

			Lexington may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted on Lexington's website, with a corresponding revision date. Please check the website and Online Ads each time you use them for the most current information and to ensure that you are aware of any updates.
