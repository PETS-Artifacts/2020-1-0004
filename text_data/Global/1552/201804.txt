Personal information submitted to the Department of Internal AffairsThe Department of Internal Affairs collects personal information from our customers to assist with the provision of a variety of services, for example, to apply for a passport, a birth certificate, or as part of a policy submission.

Information matching is carried out in accordance with Part 10 of the Privacy Act and is monitored by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. See more about information matching.

Confirmation ServiceThe Confirmation Service allows approved organisations to electronically check certain identity information. This check determines whether an individual’s supplied identity information is consistent with the information held by the Department. 

This is allowed under the Identity Information Confirmation Act 2012 (Legislation website). The individual’s consent is required before organisations can perform any checks.

The Confirmation Service helps to prevent identity-related crimes and assists organisations to provide products and services more efficiently.
