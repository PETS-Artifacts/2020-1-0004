2. GENERAL APPLICABILITY OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY 
This Privacy Policy governs only the information we collect (a) from you and (b) from Third Party Services (e.g., Facebook, etc.) and Operators about you, in each instance, on or in connection with your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your information to third parties such as affiliated companies, marketing companies, platform operators and/or technology providers, including, without limitation, our advertisers, sponsors and/or other promotional partners, including, without limitation, Third Party Services, and have agreed to share that information with us, we may obtain such information and combine it with the information we collect, and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

If you log in to the Services using account information from a Third Party Service (e.g., Facebook, etc.), connect a Third Party Service to the Services or enable functionality from a Third Party Service as part of your use of the Services, we may receive information from the applicable provider of the Third Party Service that you have consented be shared pursuant to its terms and conditions, whether made available via an application programming interface (“API”) or otherwise.

We will, as reasonably practicable (e.g., by implementing a compatible disclosure feature offered by the Third Party Service, etc.), disclose what information we collect from the Third Party Service when you connect the Services to the Third Party Service. In addition, if you connect a Third Party Service to the Services or enable functionality from the Services as part of your use of a Third Party Service, we may receive information from the provider of that Third Party Service about you or your use of the Services within that Third Party Service; such functionality may also perform actions on your behalf on the Third Party Service that are known to the Third Party Service or others. Even if you delete your account on a Third Party Service, we will retain any Information provided by that Third Party Service. Similarly, if you delete or deactivate your account on the Services, any Information that we have shared with a Third Party Service (in accordance with this Privacy Policy) may be retained by such Third Party Service.

4. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING SERVICE PROVIDERS

These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to any tracking technologies set by the Services except to the extent necessary to provide services to us in connection with the Services; however, these Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use their own tracking technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information. ASCAP does not control these Third Party Advertising Service Providers and/or their use of tracking technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Advertising Service Provider.

7. OPTING-OUT OF USE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION THAT MAY BE COLLECTED BY TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES


Tracking Technologies Set by Third Party Advertising Service Providers and Similar Third Parties: For more information about Third Party Advertising Service Providers and similar entities that use tracking technologies, see www.aboutads.info/consumers, and to opt-out of such Third Party Advertising Service Providers’ advertising practices, go to www.aboutads.info/choices.


Tracking Technologies That We Use and Set on the Services: Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies (other than Flash cookies) and allow local storage, but you should be able to change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, local storage is being used and/or to block cookies and/or the use of local storage altogether. Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.


Flash Cookies: Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe's website, see http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security/privacy_policy/faq.html.


Do-Not-Track Signals: Certain browsers transmit "do-not-track signals” to the websites in which such browsers communicate with; however, this feature, and how it is used and activated, varies from browser to browser. Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a User or whether a User is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date. ASCAP takes privacy and security very seriously. With respect to “do not track signals,” we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.


Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content and/or other personalization available through the Services.
