			Notice:This is a U.S. Government Web Site
		

			This is a World Wide Web site for official information about the United States Navy.  It is provided as a public service by the U.S. Navy's Office of Information, Washington, D.C. The purpose of this Web site is to provide information about the United States Navy to the general public.   All information on this site is considered public information and may be distributed or copied unless otherwise specified. Use of appropriate byline/photo/image credits is requested.
		

			Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this web site are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
		

			For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
		

			Except for authorized law enforcement investigation and to maintain required correspondence files, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits.  Raw data logs are used to simply determine how many users are accessing the site, which pages are the most popular, and, from time to time, from which top level domain users are coming.  This data is scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
		

			Per Department of Defense directive, the Navy's official website does not use persistent cookies (tokens that pass information back and forth from your machine to the server and remain after you close your browser), with one exception.  A persistent cookie is created when a site visitor toggles on or off the Closed Captioning of a navy.mil video.  This cookie stores only the user's preferred captioning state of the video player (on or off) and it expires after 48 hours.
		

			The appearance of hyperlinks does not constitute endorsement by the U.S. Navy of non-U.S. Government sites or the information, products, or services contained therein. Although the U.S. Navy may or may not use these sites as additional distribution channels for Department of Defense information, it does not exercise editorial control over all of the information that you may find at these locations. Such links are provided consistent with the stated purpose of this website.
