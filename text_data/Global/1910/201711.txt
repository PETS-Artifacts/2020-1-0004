We are committed to properly securing the information we collect online. To help us accomplish this, we take the following steps:
We employ internal access controls to ensure that the only people who see your information are those with a need to do so to perform their official duties;
We train relevant personnel on our privacy and security measures so that our personnel know what is required for compliance;
We physically secure the areas where we hold hard copies of the information we collect online;
We regularly back up all service request information collected online to insure against loss. It is promptly deleted from our system once your service request is completed;
We use technical controls to secure the information we collect online as appropriate, including but not limited to: Secure Socket Layer (SSL), encryption, firewalls, password protections;
We periodically test our security procedures to ensure personnel and technical compliance; and
We employ external access safeguards to identify and prevent unauthorized attempts of outsiders to hack into, or cause harm to, the information in our systems.
Tampering with a government web site, such as the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is against the law. If anyone tries to tamper with it, they may be punished under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and theÂ National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
