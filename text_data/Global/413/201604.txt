                                If you are the owner of a yacht being displayed for charter  on our website this is because the agent you have chosen to use for the charter  marketing of your yacht has placed the information about your yacht fully in  the public domain.

Superyacht Network may use the  data which we hold about yachts advertised to provide professional valuation  services and other data services to third parties. If your yacht is listed for  Charter on Yacht Charter Fleet you  may ask us not to use some or all of the details of your yacht to provide such  data services.  In this event please email the Data Controller stating your full name and  address, confirmation that you are the owner of the yacht upon whose instructions  we are entitled to act, and the name, address, email and telephone number of  the Charter Marketing Agent you have instructed to market the yacht.Changes to the policy
