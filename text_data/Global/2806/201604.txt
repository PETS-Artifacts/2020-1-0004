High Country News is firmly committed to protecting your privacy. At the same time, we do collect some information about our users so that we can better serve you.
Website Privacy
We use your computer's IP address to help diagnose problems with our site and to gather general demographic information. To get a better idea of who is using the site and how they are using it, we also use "cookies" - numbers that remain on your machine that tell us how often you visit the site, and what parts of the site you visit. We do not track your purchasing habits or target you with advertising. We do not share this information with other organizations. In the case of the eNewsletter, we never trade your email address with other organizations. Likewise, any information you enter into order forms (such as your phone number and credit card number and email address) remains confidential. When posting comments to HCN articles, please remember that any information you disclose in these areas is about to be posted publicly, so be cautious when disclosing any personal information. This site contains links to other sites and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.
Subscriber Privacy
If you subscribe to the paper, you should know that we periodically exchange subscriber lists (physical mailing address only) with other like-minded non-profit groups. List exchanges are one of our most useful tools in spreading the word about HCN and boosting our circulation. However, you have the option at any time to ask that your name not be traded. Contact circulation with your full name and address to be removed from list exchanges.
Donor Privacy
We NEVER sell, rent or trade donor information with other organizations.
If you have any questions about this privacy statement or the website in general, contact Web/IT Manager, High Country News, P.O. Box 1090, Paonia, CO 81428, use the feedback form, or call 970-527-4898.
