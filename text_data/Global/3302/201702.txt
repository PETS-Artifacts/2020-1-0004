Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information
 Gen Con LLC has developed its web site to be an enjoyable experience for you and your children. Please take a moment to discuss privacy issues with your child if you believe that they may wish to use our site. If you have any questions or comments about our policy, please drop us a line at privacy(at)gencon.com. Some examples of where you and your child may want limited information to be collected about them follow:

Chat Rooms, Bulletin Boards, Post Cards and Mailing Lists. You can register to participate in the Gen Con LLC community through our chat rooms, bulletin boards post cards and mailing lists, unless your parent or guardian asks that your registration exclude this. Personal information of registered users is not accessible by the public unless the member adds it to his or her user information or they disclose it through a public post.
E-mail. If you send us email, we will only use personal information (such as name, mailing address and e-mail address) contained in your e-mail to respond to your specific inquiry or comments in the e-mail.
Promotions To participate in some of our promotions, you may be asked to provide an e-mail address or screen name, so that we can let you know if you won a prize. In some cases, we will need your name and home address in order to send you products or information by regular mail.
Surveys In order to improve the user experience at our web sites, we may use online surveys for visitors to volunteer demographic information about themselves and provide feedback about our goods and services. 

 In these and similar situations, Gen Con LLC may collect and store personal information about children under 13 if it is submitted by way of our registration form and with the parent's verifiable consent. To determine who is younger than 13 years old and whether parental consent is required, we ask all users who wish to register to submit their date of birth. Those users that indicate they are under 13 years of age are directed to our Consent Form. If given verifiable permission from a parent, Gen Con LLC may collect and store the following types of personal information about a child under 13: name, email address, mailing address, parent's or guardian's name, and parent's or guardian's email address. Gen Con LLC may also collect demographic information about a child such as the child's date of birth, gender, and other preferences; and, combine such information with the child's personal information. Gen Con LLC will only collect this information if it is voluntarily submitted to us by the child or parent and provided with the parent's signed permission. 
The information that a child provides may be used to: 
 (a) allow the child to participate in activities on our site (e.g., contests); and, 
 (b) allow us to send the child promotional materials, including information about new products, contests, features and enhancements, special offers, and other events of interest. We may also use the information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, so that we can constantly improve the products and services we provide our visitors and to better meet their needs.
Please note that we do not condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosure of more personal information than is necessary to participate in the activity. 
Parental Access
 A parent who has given Gen Con LLC permission to collect and use his or her child's personal information can, at any time review, correct, or have deleted the child's personal information or discontinue further collection and use of the child's personal information. To do so, please contact us at privacy@gencon.com and be sure to include your child's name and email address as well as your name and email address. We will be happy to help with your request.
