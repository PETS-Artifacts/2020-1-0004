Habitat for Humanity International, Inc. (“Habitat for Humanity”) respects your privacy and preferences. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) sets forth the terms under which you share your information with Habitat for Humanity and how Habitat for Humanity collects and uses your information.
This Privacy Policy applies when you make a donation, register for an event, purchase a product, or otherwise provide us with information via the Habitat for Humanity Website located at www.habitat.org, habitatforhumanity.org, habitat.ngo, habitatforhumanity.ngo and any other domain names owned or controlled by Habitat for Humanity (the “Website”) or in another manner, such as via telephone, email, regular mail, social media, texting, mobile applications, at a special event, in response to a solicitation or face-to-face.
Each local Habitat for Humanity affiliate (“Affiliate”) is a separate legal entity, governed by an independent board of directors, executive committee or other governing body, and each Affiliate is solely responsible for its own collection and use of your information, separate and apart from this Privacy Policy.
Personal contact information collected; What Habitat for Humanity does with it
Habitat for Humanity may request from you, or you may volunteer to provide, your contact information, including your name, mailing address, phone number(s), social media handles and email address(es). Habitat for Humanity may, by way of example, use your contact information to:
Send you additional information about Habitat for Humanity and its programs or events.

When you sign up for a program or make a donation allocated to a local Affiliate or program, your contact information may be passed on to representatives or designees of such Affiliate or program.
If you make a donation or a purchase, or otherwise provide your information, Habitat for Humanity may contact you from time to time about opportunities to make additional donations or purchases or to provide information about services from third parties.

Credit card and billing information
In addition to your contact information, when you make a donation or purchase, Habitat for Humanity asks for your billing address and credit card or other financial services information. Habitat for Humanity uses a third-party banking agent to process your payments via a secured socket layer connection (TLS 1.2 using SHA 256 encryption) to a secured server that verifies your credit card/bank information. They return a unique tracking number only, which cannot be decrypted to obtain the payment card information, and Habitat for Humanity never retains your complete credit card number. Only employees who need access to your personal information to perform a specific job are granted access to that information, and Habitat for Humanity and our banking agent will not share your credit card/bank information with any other third party.
Other contact information
Habitat for Humanity may ask for contact information for people other than yourself, including, for example, names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses of others to whom you send information or in whose honor or behalf you are making a donation or purchase. Habitat for Humanity uses this information to send notifications or information you requested and/or to inform the recipient of your donation or purchase, as well as to contact the recipient from time to time to inform them of other opportunities and information about Habitat for Humanity. Like you, the recipient will always have the opportunity to opt out of receiving future communication from Habitat for Humanity.
