Privacy Principles
Because your privacy is important to us, we will operate by the following principles of Notice, Choice, Security, and Reasonable Access. Users seeking additional information regarding the principles should write to feedback.

RAND collects information in the following categories depending upon purpose or need:

Billing information
Demographics

Credit card numbers are used for processing of orders only and are not given to third parties except for processing your order. Under their agreements with us, these third-party partners may not retain, share, store, or use personal information for any secondary purposes. If necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was submitted, or if you give your consent, RAND may use your personal information to operate its site and provide services, to communicate with you regarding your RAND account(s), to fulfill orders and requests, to allow participation in voluntary activities (such as discussion forums), or to compile general demographic statistics. RAND is the only party that collects personal information at this site. RAND does not allow any other party to use its site to collect personal information. CHOICE
As a general rule, RAND uses personal information only for the purpose for which it was submitted. At the time of collection, RAND may ask whether you will permit RAND to use your personal information in other ways. For example, RAND may ask you whether you would like to receive certain information and email from RAND or its service partners, or if you wish to participate in demographic surveys. Unless you specifically consent to such use, RAND will use your information only for the purpose for which it was submitted.
RAND will not send you unsolicited information, commercial offers, or advertisements, including email, without your consent. If at any time you would like to be removed from our physical mailing list (e.g., to receive printed catalogs), please send an email message to order@rand.org, or write to RAND Distribution Services at the address below. To unsubscribe from an email mailing list, login to your My RAND account using the email address at which you receive RAND newsletters. You will then be able to manage your current subscriptions.
If RAND decides to change its privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and the circumstances, if any, under which we disclose it. If at any point RAND decides to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not RAND uses their information in this different manner. RAND will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

RAND will disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served you, RAND, or the site.REASONABLE ACCESS
