Flaticon refers back to these sections to obtain more information about how to deactivate or delete cookies.
Flaticon recommends Users not to deactivate cookies because they help to make the most of some of the functionalities.
This Website has also access to the IP address from which Users visit it. The Users IP address may be different each time they visit the Website. In addition, several Users may share the same IP address. Although Flaticon does not and will never perform any inquiry to link a certain IP address with a certain person, the access to IP addresses may be considered as personal information as they can potentially be associated to a real person (a possibility more theoretical than real), so according to Spanish personal data protection laws, this law applies to IP addresses as well.
Third-parties who advertise in the Website or those to which the User gets connected through plugins might use cookies or 'web beacons' that Flaticon doesn't control, so Flaticon would not be responsible and they would not be covered by this Privacy and Cookies Policy, thus, it is the responsibility of the Users to configure their browser to make sure that cookies are only used according to their preferences.
