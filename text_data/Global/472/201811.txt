The Internet Solutions Abuse Department is responsible for the administration of abuse queries and complaints and ensures that clients are made aware of abuse complaints that have been lodged against them.   The IS Abuse Department defines ‘abuse’ as any behaviour by a user connected to the IS network that is considered unacceptable as per the IS AUP (Acceptable Use Policy).   Abuse complaints may include, but are not limited to, spam, copyright infringements, virus/worm attacks, security related issues (phishing, hack attempts, DOS attacks) and general abuse (harassment and vulgarities). IS Abuse concerns itself solely with abuse queries originating from the IS network.
What do we do
It is considered standard practice for an ISP (Internet Service Provider) to acknowledge action and inform complainants of action taken in the event of violations to the ISP's AUP. A standard AUP contains definitions of what is considered to be abusive behaviour (e.g. Spam, DoS Attacks, Phishing etc.), and some indication of action taken for each level of abuse.
Our Obligations

Inform all clients of abuse complaints lodged against them
Follow-up on all abuse complaints to its clients until a resolution is reached
Notify the client of any suspicious activity or viruses on the client's network
Uphold the ISPA (Internet Service Providers’ Association) Code of Conduct
Uphold client confidentiality

The purpose of this document is to provide an understanding of Internet Solutions’ Acceptable Use Policy. This policy serves to define the accepted behaviour of users on Internet Solutions’ (IS) network. This allows IS to: 

Maintain the integrity and quality of their services
Protect their customers and infrastructure from abuse
Adhere to the current laws and regulations governing organisations and service providers in the countries that they operate in
Co-exist within the global internet community as a responsible service provider.

The Network

The user acknowledges that IS is unable to exercise control over the data passing over the infrastructure and the Internet, including but not limited to any websites, electronic mail transmissions, news groups or other material created or accessible over its infrastructure. Therefore, IS is not responsible for data transmitted over its infrastructure.
IS' infrastructure may be used to link into other networks worldwide and the user agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these networks.
Users of the IS network include not only the IS customers, but in the case of resellers of the IS’ services, the customers of the resellers too.  Resellers of IS’ services are responsible for the activities of their customers.
The user may obtain and download any materials marked as available for download off the Internet, but is not permitted to use their Internet access to distribute any copyrighted materials unless permission for such distribution is granted to the user by the owner of the materials.
The user is prohibited from obtaining, disseminating or facilitating over IS’ network any unlawful materials, including but not limited to:

Copying or dealing in intellectual property without authorisation
Child pornography, and/or
Any unlawful hate-speech materials 


To help ensure that all customers have fair and equal use of the service and to protect the integrity of the network, Internet Solutions reserves the right, and will take necessary steps, to prevent improper or excessive usage thereof.
The action that Internet Solutions may take includes, but is not limited to:

Limiting throughput
Preventing or limiting service through specific ports or communication protocols; and/or
Complete termination of service to customers who grossly abuse the network through improper or excessive usage


This policy applies to and will be enforced for intended and unintended (e.g., viruses, worms, malicious code, or otherwise unknown causes) prohibited usage.
Online activity will be subject to the available bandwidth, data storage and other limitations of the service provided, which Internet Solutions may, from time to time, revise at its own discretion and without prior notice to the customer

System and Network security

All references to systems and networks under this section includes the Internet (and all those systems and/or networks to which user is granted access through IS) and includes but is not limited to the infrastructure of IS itself
The user may not circumvent user authentication or security of any host, device, network, or account (referred to as "cracking" or "hacking"), nor interfere with service to any user, host, device, or network (referred to as "denial of service attacks"). The host, device, network or account shall also not be used for any illegal purpose, including phishing
Violations of system or network security by the user are prohibited, and may result in civil or criminal liability. IS will investigate incidents involving such violations and will involve and co-operate with law enforcement officials if a criminal violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation, the following:

Unauthorised access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of any system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without the express authorisation of IS
Unauthorised monitoring of data or traffic on the network or systems without express authorisation of IS
Interference with service to any user, device, host or network including, without limitation, mail bombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks
Forging of any TCP-IP packet header (spoofing) or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting



e-Mail Use

It is explicitly prohibited to send unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam") of any kind (commercial advertising, political tracts, announcements, etc). This is strongly objected to by most Internet users and the repercussions against the offending party and IS can often result in disruption of service to other users connected to IS. In addition, spam is unlawful in terms of the Electronic Communications and Transaction Act 2002, and IS is entitled to take appropriate steps against the User in contravention of these provisions of the Act

This policy describes the expected requirements for settlement-free peering between the applicant and Internet Solutions (IS). Any type of settlement-based peering doesn’t fall within the scope of this policy.
General Peering Policy statement

IS will peer directly or through any public Internet Exchange (preferable a community driven Internet Exchange) with any Internet Protocol (IP) based service provider.
IS prefers that all of the criteria defined below are met and agree that the conditions of the peering agreement will be determined by current and periodic reviews of this peering policy.
Peering will be done on a negotiated basis, with location and cost as agreed to by both parties.
IS prefers that no written peering agreement be entered into but may consider it upon request by the applicant.
The contractual relationship between IS and its peering partner, including all the respective parties’ rights and obligations, will be constituted solely by this peering agreement.  No rights or obligations are intended to arise out of or be conferred through the Peering Policy.
Both parties do agree that peering is fully based on a best effort basis without any guarantees whatsoever.
In addition to the mentioned criteria, IS’ willingness to enter into peering arrangements will be subject to generally accepted commercial and technical considerations, including but not limited to the availability of peering ports and IS’ backbone capacity in particular locations.
It should be noted that the Peering Policy contains the general guidelines which will determine IS’ peering relationships. In all circumstances, irrespective of compliance with the Peering Policy, the decision on whether or not to peer with any particular party will be in IS’ sole and unfettered discretion.

Amendments to Internet Solutions' Peering Policy

IS conducts periodic internal reviews of the Peering Policy to ensure it is staying relevant to changing business requirements.
IS reserves the right to modify the Peering Policy at any time in its sole and unfettered discretion.
Based on such modifications, existing peering partners may be asked at times to re-qualify for continued peering.

Peering criteria
Section one contains the interconnection requirements which the network of a peering applicant must have in order for the applicant to be eligible for peering with IS. Section two contains the technical and operational requirements which the network of the peering applicant must comply with in order to peer with IS. Section three outlines any other general notices.
Section one: Interconnection requirement
In order to determine whether bilateral peering is mutually beneficial in a particular case, the extent of the geographic distribution of the Peering Applicant’s network will be the key indicator.
Geographic Scope

IS prefers that the Peering Applicant should be able to accommodate peering links in at least two geographically dispersed locations such as Cape Town and Johannesburg.

Backbone Capacity

IS prefers that the Peering Applicant must have a fully redundant backbone network with sufficient bandwidth to carry its own national traffic.

ISPA Membership

Peering applications from Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) members will be preferred, however non-members may also be considered suitable for peering on a case by case basis.

Customer Relationship

No peering applicant who is an IS transit client and maintains transit connections with IS at one or more locations shall be entitled to enter into a peering relationship.
IS prefers not peer with customers of any of its current peering partners.

Section two: Technical and operational requirements
Routing requirements

Both parties should attempt to endorse the principles described in Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS).
For onward advertisements, each Party must set the next hop to be itself. Hence, each Party will be seen as the next hop for its respective transit clients.
Each Party will implement “shortest exit routing” and advertise routes consistent with that policy, unless both Parties mutually agree otherwise based on special circumstances.
Each Party will restrict its advertisements to non-transit routes originating within the geographic region in which peering has been established and will not announce the received route outside of the region.
IS requires consistent route advertisements at all peering locations.
Under normal operating conditions, all traffic exchanged between IS and the Peering Applicant will occur over the peering connection.

General requirements
Section three: General policy notices

The requirements in section one must be met before peering can be established.
The requirements contained herein must continue to be met to continue a settlement-free interconnection relationship. The peering partner’s status under this Peering Policy will be evaluated periodically. In the case of a change in ownership or control of aPeering Partner, status of the peering relationship in terms of the Peering Policy will be evaluated within 30 days of such change.
IS reserves the right to terminate any peering relationship, for violations of the Peering Policy, or as a result of breach of the Peering Agreement. The Peering Agreement will provide that IS may terminate peering with a Peering Partner with immediate effect for non-compliance with the Peering Policy.
Peering with IS will be subject to IS' Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). IS reserves the right to terminate any peering relationship, for violations of its AUP by a Peering Partner or any of its customers.
IS reserve the right to set, and/or convert any, and all route filters, and filter types at its sole discretion, to preserve network stability and route sanity. Reasonable effect will be made to notify the peer of the change.

Contacts
Parties who do not meet the requirements above can become an IS client by emailing sales@is.co.za
All questions about peering with IS can be sent to the IS Network Operations team at peering@is.co.za

IS is obliged to protect its technical infrastructure against security threats and to protect the interests of its customers by ensuring that the conduct of no one customer prejudices the user experience of the other customers. Accordingly, IS imposes certain reasonable rules relating to the Customer’s conduct while using the Services which are contained in IS’ Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) (available at www.is.co.za/Legal by clicking on the “legal” link). Because security threats can be fluid and acceptable usage can change, IS may from time to time amend this AUP by publication on its website. These amendments will not materially affect the Agreement, but will merely update the limits of the Customer’s existing duty to use the Services in a safe and responsible manner.
Customer shall not commit nor attempt to commit any act or omission which directly or indirectly

Damages in any way IS’ technical infrastructure or any part thereof
Impedes, impairs or precludes IS from being able to provide the Service/s in a reasonable and business-like manner
Constitutes an abuse or malicious misuse of the Service/s; or is calculated to have any of the abovementioned effects. In such an event, should IS incur expenses to remedy the situation, IS reserves the right to charge the Customer the amount necessary to cover IS’ additional expenditure. Notwithstanding the above, IS reserves the right to take any other appropriate action it may deem necessary to remedy the situation.


Customer is prohibited from selling, reselling or otherwise dealing with the Service/s which are proprietary to IS in any manner whatsoever. Without limitation to the a foregoing, any consideration which Customer may receive whilst acting in breach of this prohibition shall be forfeited to IS.
Customer is prohibited from allowing any person other than its employees or other authorised parties, access to the Service/s through any of Customer’s Equipment, personnel and/or address.
Customer is prohibited from modifying any Equipment (including but not limited to router equipment) utilised by Customer to receive any of the Service/s, in any way whatsoever, including the changing of any of the settings of such Equipment.
Customer shall at all times adhere to and ensure compliance with the Schedule/s, if applicable
Under no circumstances may Customer resile from this Agreement or withhold or defer payment or be entitled to a reduction in any charge or have any other right or remedy against IS, its servants, its agents or any other persons for whom it may be liable in law if IS interrupts the Service to Customer as it would be entitled to do if Customer is in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement to IS.
Customer may not at any time use the Service in contravention of any South African Law. Customer acknowledges that IS has no obligation to assist Customer in obtaining knowledge and/or clarity in terms of the applicable South African Law.



Provision of the Services by IS

To the extent that the provisions of the CPA are applicable to this Agreement, in the event that the Customer alleges that there is a defect in the quality of the Services, the only remedy that the Customer will have against IS, is to require IS to remedy the defect in the quality of the Services performed.
If IS has supplied Equipment to enable the Customer to utilise the Services in the circumstances set out in clause 6.1, defects in the Equipment will be dealt with as described in clause 7.



Returns and Refunds

If the provisions of the CPA are applicable to this Agreement, to the extent that Equipment is supplied to a Customer, the Equipment is warranted in respect of quality, suitability and durability for a period of 6 (six) months of the Effective Date in respect of the Equipment concerned. Provided the Customer is not in breach of the Agreement, Customer may within this period return the Equipment to IS without penalty if the Equipment fails to satisfy the requirements and standards contemplated and IS shall repair or replace the failed, unsafe or defective Equipment.
If Customer elects to enforce the provisions of clause 7.1 and, within 3 (three) months of any repair undertaken by IS, the failure, defect or unsafe feature has not been remedied, or a further failure, defect or unsafe feature is discovered by Customer, IS shall, in its sole and absolute discretion:

Not to procure repair or maintenance of the Equipment by any third party without the prior written consent of IS (which shall not be unreasonably withheld) or in any other manner tamper with the Equipment





Limitation of Liability

IS shall not be liable for any loss (including but not limited to loss of data, profits and goodwill), liability, damages (whether direct, indirect or consequential) or expense of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising where IS’s failure, delay or inability to perform any of the Service/s is due to the occurrence of any of the following events:

The Customer's failure to perform, or delay in performing its obligations in terms of this Agreement; or
Circumstances that constitute an event of force majeure as contemplated in clause 17 hereof; or
All telecommunications infrastructure and communication line faults; or
Failure or unreasonable delay by the Customer to report faults/problems to IS; or
The failure of any hardware, software programme, applications/s or any other computer systems (or any component thereof) or product or service of any third party on whom the Customer relies (whether directly or indirectly) to use the Service/s and/or on which IS relies to provide the Service/s.


IS shall not be responsible for any loss (including but not limited to loss of data, profits and goodwill), liability, damages (whether direct, indirect or consequential) or expense of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising if such loss is caused by any defect or failure in the Equipment due to:

Subject to clause 10.1 - 10.3 above, the entire liability of IS and Customer's exclusive remedy for damages from any cause related to or arising out of this Agreement, regardless of the form of action, whether in contract or in delict, will not exceed the aggregate of the fees and charges paid by Customer under this Agreement for the period of 12 (twelve) months preceding Customer's written notice to IS in respect of such claim.
Customer hereby indemnifies IS against and holds IS harmless from any claim by any third party arising directly or indirectly out of access to or use of the Service/s or information obtained through the use thereof or in respect of any matter for which liability of IS is excluded in terms of clause 10.1 - 10.3 above.
Because of the need to conduct maintenance, repair and/or improvement work from time to time on the technical infrastructure by means of which the Services are provided, the provision of the Services may be suspended from time to time on reasonable notice to Customer, and all liability on the part of IS of any loss or damage (whether direct or consequential) thereby incurred or for any costs, claims, or demands of any nature arising therefrom, is excluded.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, IS reserves the right in its absolute discretion and after the receipt by IS of any take-down notice in terms of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25, 2002 or through any other legal and/or regulatory complaint, mechanism or process from any governmental department or agency, or any other third party (including but not limited to any Internet industry body or any other organisation) that Customer’s web site contains information that infringes against any third party’s rights in terms of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, any other legislative enactment or regulation in force from time to time, or is defamatory in nature, to immediately give written notice to Customer of IS’ intention to remove the offending information or any portion thereof from Customer’s web site. Should such offending information not be removed from the web site by Customer within 24 hours of written notice to that effect, IS shall be entitled to immediately remove the offending information or any portion thereof from Customer’s web site, or where it is not possible to remove such content, to terminate the Hosting Services of such Customer. Any removal or termination by IS shall in no way constitute a breach by IS of this Agreement.

General

No variation, amendment or consensual cancellation of this Agreement or any provision or term thereof or of any agreement, bill of exchange or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement shall be binding unless recorded in a written document signed by a duly authorized representative from both IS and Customer. With respect to new pricing and/or service specifications in respect of existing Service/s, an IS MAC Form signed by a duly authorised representative of IS and a duly authorised representative of Customer will constitute a written variation of the Agreement in accordance with this clause 21.1.
The parties acknowledge having read and understood this Agreement and are not entering into this Agreement on the basis of any representations not expressly set forth in it.
Neither Party shall be bound by any express or implied term, representation, warranty, promise or the like not recorded herein, whether it induced the Agreement between Customer and IS or not.
No extension of time or waiver or relaxation of any of the provisions or terms of this Agreement, bill of exchange or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement, shall operate as an estoppel against either Party hereto in respect of its right under this Agreement, nor shall it operate so as to preclude either of the parties thereafter from exercising its rights strictly in accordance with this Agreement.
In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with any statute, ruling or order of any governmental or regulatory body from time to time, then such provision of this Agreement shall be controlled by the statute, ruling or order.
Nothing in the Agreement shall constitute a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment between the Parties hereto, and neither Party shall have the authority or power to bind, or contract in the name of, or to create a liability against the other in any way for any purpose.
Should any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement be held to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, such terms and conditions will be severable from the remaining terms and conditions which will continue to be valid and enforceable.
In the event of any expiration, termination or cancellation of this Agreement, provisions hereof which are intended to continue and survive shall so continue and survive. In particular, termination or cancellation of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or duties arising under it with respect to Proprietary Information as set out in clause 14 above.
The terms and conditions appearing in the Schedule(s) hereto are hereby incorporated into the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Standard Terms and Conditions of this Agreement and those appearing in any Schedule/s hereto, these Standard Terms and Conditions shall prevail.

These terms and conditions, together with the Schedule(s), Annexures and attachments hereto, constitute the whole of the agreement between IS and Customer relating to the subject matter hereof, notwithstanding anything in Customer’s inquiry, specification, acceptance, order or other documentation or discussion to the contrary.



Application of the Consumer Protection Act

A transaction (as defined in the CPA) between the Customer and IS may or may not fall under the provisions of the CPA depending upon whether certain values set out in clause 22.2 in respect of the Customer (“Threshold Values”) are below a certain value at the time the transaction is entered into.
The Threshold Values are the Customer's asset value or annual turnover, and the value against which they are measured is as determined by the Minister of Trade and Industry by publication in the Government Gazette from time to time
IS' duties towards the Customer may vary depending upon whether the transaction in question is subject to the CPA, and IS will act upon the information given to it by the Customer in this regard. Consequently:

The Customer warrants that any statement made to IS in respect of its Threshold Values is accurate.
If the Customer claims that all the Threshold Values are below the relevant value, or otherwise that the CPA applies to the transaction in question, IS may at its instance require the Customer to provide it with financial statements as proof thereof.





If the Customer misstates the Threshold Values in such a way that IS considers for a period that the transaction is subject to the CPA when it is not, all provisions of this Agreement that do not apply to transactions subject to the CPA shall retroactively apply to the transaction in question, and the Customer shall be liable for any damage sustained by IS resulting from such misstatement.
