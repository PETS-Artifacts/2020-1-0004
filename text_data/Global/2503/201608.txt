Providing us with personal information.
There are instances where you may elect to provide us with personal information. 
If you place an order with us, participate in our Monthly Quiz, or fill out our customer feedback form, you are 
transmitting the information that appears to you in the form or the message. This will typically include information 
like your name, mailing address, email address, Make, Model and Year of your vehicle and any other information necessary to 
fulfill your request. You never transmit personally identifying information that you do not enter yourself. And this 
is always your option; this information cannot be collected unless you specifically elect to send it to us. This information is 
used internally only for the purpose of fulfilling the request or for contacting you directly and is not given or sold to any 
other organization. Quadratec.com is not compatible with the "Do not track" feature available in some web browsers.

What do we do with this information?
The information is primarily used to improve our site for the purpose of better serving our valued 
customers. Occasionally we will use the information to send our customers an e-mail announcement. 
This e-mail may contain new product introductions and/or exclusive offers specifically tailored for 
the vehicles they own. For example: We don't want to send you a special deal on a Jeep top, 
if you drive a Dodge Ram.
