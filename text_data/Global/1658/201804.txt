We respect your privacy and we are committed to protecting your personal information as that term is defined in the Act (“Information”). We comply with the principles of the Act and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of your Information.
 This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) explains how we collect, use and disclose your Information. This Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions about your Information when using our website or one of our apps.

 If we change our Policy and/or procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what Information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. Your continued use of our website or App(s) after this Policy has been amended shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Policy, as amended. We encourage you to review this Policy regularly.
 In addition to this Policy, each service offered by us or our group companies may have additional privacy provisions that are specific to the particular service. These supplemental disclosures are made adjacent to the particular service at the time your Information is collected.
    2. What information do we collect?  When you use our website or one of our Apps you may provide us with or we may collect your Information such as your postal address, email address and other personal information. You may provide or we may collect this Information in a number of ways:
 2.1 Information you voluntarily provide to us
 We collect and maintain Information that you voluntarily submit to us during any registration and/or use of our website or App(s). For example:
 • when you register for an account, you may provide us with certain Information including your name, email address, username, password, date of birth, region and demographic information;

You can choose not to provide us with certain Information, but this may prevent you from gaining access to a service or limit the features that you can use on our website or an App. For more information, please see the “How We Use Your Information” section of the Policy below.
 2.2 Information we collect through your use of our services
 As you use our website or one of our Apps, Information such as location Information may also be passively collected by us through our use of Location Services, GPS, Bluetooth and other technologies. This Information does not identify you individually but allows us to deliver more helpful information, services, tools and advertisements.
 We also collect cookie information. A cookie is a small file that is automatically issued to your computer when you enter our site and which is stored by the browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies identify your computer, not the individual user of your computer. Cookies store some basic information that helps us to identify if a user of your computer has visited the site before and if you have provided us with some personalised information. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password (if you have supplied us with one) so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes. You can disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent, but if you choose to do so you may not be able to access some areas of the site.
 2.3 Information we receive from third parties
 We may also combine information received from third parties (including other members of our group of companies) with your Information. The third party information is used for a variety of purposes including to enhance the content and advertising we provide to you.
