  Google AdWords and Other Behavioral Advertising. The Site may from time to time use Google AdWords and Google AdSense, online advertising services provided by Google Inc. ("Google"). Both Google AdWords and Google AdSense services will collect anonymous information about your visits to and interactions with the Site and other web sites and will use this information to target advertisements for goods and services. These targeted advertisements may appear on the Site or on other web sites that you visit. The anonymous information is collected through the use of a "tag," which is industry-standard technology. To opt out of remarketing advertising provided through Google or to customize your ad preferences, visit Google's Ad Settings page at https://www.google.com/settings/ads. Opting out will not affect your use of the Site. 
  We may also use other third party ad networks (called third-party ad servers or network advertisers), including various social media platforms (as discussed below) to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third party ad networks may place their cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other technology on the Site, on our ads that appear across the Internet or in your browser to collect non-personal information about you when you visit this Site (such as browser type, time and date, browsing or transaction activity, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, or a platform-provided identifier during your visits to this and other websites) to enable those third party ad networks to deliver to you advertisements on third party websites and mobile applications for our products or services or those of third parties that are likely to be of greater interest to you. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis. 
  Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity may also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

Opting out of online ads with one ad network and web browser does not necessarily carryover to any other ad network or web browser. As a result, depending on the opt-outs you request, you may still see our ads from time to time. 
  Google Analytics. The Site uses a variety of analytics tools to collect information about your use of the Site and your visits to this Site and other web sites. Our primary analytics provider is Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google, to collect information about your use of the Site, which information your web browser automatically sends to Google. This information includes the web address of the web sites that you visit and your IP address. Google may also set cookies or read preexisting cookies. This information is stored on Google's servers. Google uses this information to provide us with reports about Site traffic and your visits to the Site (for example, the domain from which you access the Internet, the web address of the web site from which you linked to the Site, and the date and time of your visit to the web sites that you view and click through).

These features may require us to implement cookies, plug-ins, and application protocol interfaces (APIs) provided by those social media platforms. We may share information that you provide us or that we may collect about your use of the Site with those platforms and that information will be subject to their privacy policies. For further information, we encourage you to review those platforms' privacy policies: Facebook's Data Policy at https://www.facebook.com/full_data_use_policy; Pinterest's Privacy Policy at https://about.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy. 
  The Site may also use the advertising services and networks offered by those social media platforms to deliver advertising content. Use of these services requires social media platforms to implement cookies or pixel tags to deliver ads to you while you are logged into the platform. If you do not wish a social media platform to collect information relating to you via the Site, we suggest that you: (i) hide social media platform plug-ins using an ad blocker; (ii) always log off completely from the social media platform before visiting other web sites and delete all related cookies; and, (iii) where the option is available, disable the advertising services and networks operated by a social media platform. However, we have no control over any social media company's ad policies or processes and cannot ensure you will not see our ads on those platforms even if you follow the above.
