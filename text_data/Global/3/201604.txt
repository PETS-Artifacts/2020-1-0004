Information Collection, Use, and Sharing

We are the sole owners of the information collected on this site. We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us via
email or other direct contact from you. We will not sell or rent this information to anyone.


We will use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party
outside of our organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request, e.g. to deliver an item.


Unless you ask us not to, we may contact you via email in the future to tell you about specials, new products or services, or changes to this
privacy policy.

Your Access to and Control Over Information

You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following at any time by contacting us immediately via email:


See what data we have about you, if any.
Change/correct any data we have about you.
Have us delete any data we have about you.

Security

We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and offline.


Wherever we collect sensitive information, that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking
for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.


While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need
the information to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable information.
The computers/servers in which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.


If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via email.
