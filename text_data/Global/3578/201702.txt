The American Counseling Association (ACA) respects the privacy of its members and other visitors to its Web site. ACA strongly believes that if electronic commerce and online activities are to flourish, consumers must be assured that information provided online is used responsibly and appropriately. To protect online privacy, ACA has implemented the following policy. ACA is located in the United States and this is a U.S.-based website. By using this site, you agree to the transfer and processing of your personal information to or within the United States. Policy Changes If there are material changes to our privacy policies, we will notify you by posting the updated policy on our site, and for registered users, by sending an email. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review this page frequently for any changes. Amendments to this privacy policy will be effective when posted. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted, the changes to any amended or revised privacy policy by your continued use of our services or the site. What Information Does ACA Collect? Most data ACA collects is used only to help us better serve our members. It is our general policy to collect and store only personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide.  From General Users. ACA does not automatically collect any personal information from users browsing its website. Only aggregate data -- such as the number of hits per page -- are collected. Aggregate data are only used for internal and marketing purposes and do not provide any personally identifying information. From ACA's Members, Conference Registrants, and Other Customers. To gain access to members-only resources and personalization features on counseling.org, members and other users are asked to register and provide some limited information. ACA and its partners may collect IP address and other specific non-personally identifying information for targeted or interest-based communications. This information is submitted voluntarily. ACA asks users to provide their name, organization name, business phone, and email. Similar information may be submitted to ACA through membership applications, conference or seminar registration, publication orders, subscriptions, and contest registrations. Additionally, for some e-mails sent in HTML format by ACA to its members through its communities (ACA Connect) and electronic newsletters, ACA, or our authorized service providers, will collect specific information regarding what the recipient does with that email. For those emails, ACA will monitor whether a recipient subsequently clicks through to links provided in the message. Other information collected through this tracking feature includes: email address of a user, the date and time of the user’s “click,” a message number, name of the list from which the message was sent, tracking URL number, and destination page. ACA only uses this information to enhance its products and distribution of those products to its members.  What About Information About Children? We do not direct the website to, nor do we knowingly collect personal information from, children under 16 years of age.  How Does ACA Use Data Collected? ACA uses information voluntarily submitted by members and other customers in the following ways: ACA Member Services and Products. Generally, ACA and its direct subsidiaries use data collected to improve its own web content; to respond to visitors’ interests, needs and preferences; and to develop new products and services. Disclosures to Third Parties. ACA also makes member contact information available through the ACA Connect Membership Directory to other members using its website and to those who register for its conferences. On occasion, ACA may also provide limited data to third parties that offer products and services. These limited data include names, job titles, companies, business addresses, and email addresses, but do not include business phone or fax numbers. Users may contact ACA at membership@counseling.org or 703-823-9800 to express their preferences if they determine later that they do not wish to have the information shared. Please include “Web Privacy Policy Question or Comment” in the subject line. Credit Card Account Information. When members and customers choose to pay using their credit cards, ACA submits the information needed to obtain payment to the appropriate third-party payment vendors for the limited purpose of processing your payment. ACA does not otherwise disclose your credit card information. Compliance with Law. We may provide access to your information, including personal information, when legally required to do so, to cooperate with legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors of this website or the public. How Does ACA Use Cookies and Pixel Tags? Cookies. Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on a user’s hard disk for use either during a particular session (“per-session” cookie) or for future use (“persistent” cookie). ACA and its partners may use cookies to facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, determine appropriate solicitations, and review navigation patterns. Cookies are not used to disseminate personally identifiable information about Users over the Internet or to analyze any information that Users have knowingly or unknowingly provided. Users may instruct their Internet browsers to opt out of accepting a “persistent” cookie and rather accept only a “per-session” cookie, but will need to login each time they visit the site to enjoy the full benefits. If the user declines the attachment of any cookie, the user may not have access to the full benefits of the website. Registration enables the site to better determine users’ interest areas and provide the most relevant information.  Pixel Tags. We also use “pixel tags” (sometimes called “Internet tags,” “web beacons,” or “clear GIFS”), which are tiny graphic images, on our website. Pixel tags help us analyze our visitors’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information. Pixel tags on our website may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the website. This information may include your IP address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer or device.  Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us. We also work with business partners that use tracking technologies to deliver advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our website, and your interaction with our advertising and other communications. What Privacy Issues Arise With Links To Other Sites? This website contains links to other websites. ACA has no control over and is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such sites. In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other sites. If you provide personal information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the ACA’s privacy policy. Please make sure you understand the other site's privacy policy before providing personal information.
