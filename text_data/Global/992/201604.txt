Our websites automatically log your IP address and domain name, and non-personal information such as the type of web browser you use, to help us administer the sites and to compile statistics such as the number of visitors.
Our websites use cookies to identify you over multiple visits to the site, for example to remember your country and provide country-specific content. Cookies are optional, and you can block or delete them. However, some parts of our websites (e.g. chat pages) will not work without cookies.
Submission of Personal Information
Certain portions of the site may require that you submit some personal information, such as your name and email address, before using those portions of the site. At minimum, you are typically required to register with the site and provide your name or email address before using any of the members only areas of the site. For some services, such as forums, the Avid Artist Community, customer support features, registering for events or contests, downloading software or uploading content, you may have to create an account, and submit additional personal information such as your mailing address.
Use of Personal Information
Avid uses information it collects to provide the services and information you select, to better understand its customers, to provide better products and services, and to assist with site administration, such as with troubleshooting any problems, detecting fraud, resolving disputes, and for any purposes deemed necessary or required by Avid to enforce the Terms of Use and other terms or conditions applicable to any portion of the site.
We also use this information to send you information about Avid, or other topics Avid thinks may be of interest to you, such as product information or updates. As part of its business, Avid works with authorized partners, such as authorized resellers, to provide you with the services and information. As part of those activities, Avid may share your information with those authorized entities so that they can directly provide the information or services to you.
Aggregation and Use of Anonymous Data
Avid aggregates information provided by you to create anonymous statistical and demographic data. This anonymous data helps Avid to understand and know its customer base better. That anonymous data may be provided to third parties but never in such a fashion as to identify you personally.  Some Avid products use Google Analytics for the collection of anonymous data. Learn more about how Google uses data collected using Google Analytics.  
Third Parties
Avid does not sell to third parties information you have submitted to this site that identifies you personally.
On occasion, Avid may offer in conjunction with third parties certain services that may require you to share your personal information with that third party as a condition for receiving that service. In addition, if you purchase third party products on the Avid online store, Avid may share your information with the manufacturer of that product. While Avid will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy Statement, Avid will not be responsible for the information submitted by you to that third party, and we remind you to review the applicable rules and any third party's applicable privacy policies separately before participating in such service.

You can opt out of receiving Avid marketing messages; see the Accept/Decline section below. Please note that it may take us a reasonable amount of time to process your request.
Even if you decline to receive information or cancel your account, Avid reserves the right to use the information you previously provided to provide you with the Avid products and services you are eligible to receive and to contact you about administrative matters relating to your use of any portion of the site, your account, or about any issues relating to the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy, or any other policy then in-effect (for example, the Copyright Complaint Policy).

Surveys
From time to time Avid may make online surveys available to users of the site. Participation in those surveys is voluntary. Some online surveys may ask participants for personal information, such as an email address, in addition to requesting answers to survey questions. Avid may use that personal information to contact the participant if necessary, or as otherwise described above. Avid may make the results of any survey publicly available, although Avid will not attribute any particular response to you without your permission.
Contests
On occasion Avid may make available to users of the site contests, sweepstakes, or similar events in which they may qualify for participation.

Avid may permit a third party to sponsor a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("third party event") with Avid, such as through posting it on the site. Such third party events are governed solely by any applicable rules, and may require you to provide information to that third party as a condition for participation. While Avid will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Avid is not responsible for the information gathered by that third party, and Avid reminds you to review the rules and privacy policies separately applicable to those third party events.
CHILDREN

For sites that are intended for use by children we have put in place additional privacy practices which are described on those sites.

NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS
Please note that the information you enter on the site or otherwise provide to Avid Technology, or its subsidiaries or divisions, may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for purposes of processing, by Avid Technology, Inc. a company located in Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.A., or its subsidiaries or Avid's subsidiaries or divisions, or authorized partners, located worldwide, in order to provide this site and its services to you. You are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. You are further advised that the Council of the European Union has found that this model does not provide "adequate" privacy protections as contemplated by Article 25 of the European Union's Data Directive. (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31)
Article 26 of the European Union's Data Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.
By agreeing to this Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and the processing of that information as described in this Policy
