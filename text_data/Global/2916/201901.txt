Wherever we rely on the Consent Legal Basis, you may withdraw such consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before such withdrawal.  Recipients.  We may disclose the personal data you provide as necessary to our affiliates, divisions and groups worldwide (see http://resource.thermofisher.com/page/DB_17_0119/?cid=fl-legalentities) and service providers, who act on our behalf and instructions to fulfill product orders, deliver services, provide IT support.  Personal Data Transfers outside of the EEA.  Some recipients located outside of the EEA are located in countries for which the European Commission has issued adequacy decisions (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en ). In each case, the transfer is thereby recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective (see Article 45 of the EU GDPR).  Some recipients are located in countries for which the European Commission has not issued an adequacy decision in respect of the level of data protection there, including The U.S. (where the recipient is not Privacy Shield certified). By entering into appropriate data transfer agreements based on Standard Contractual Clauses (2010/87/EU and/or 2004/915/EC) as referred to in Article 46(5) of the EU GDPR or other adequate means, we have established that all such recipients will provide an adequate level of data protection and that appropriate technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and against all other unlawful forms of processing. Any onward transfer (including to our affiliates outside the EEA) is subject to appropriate onward transfer requirements as required by applicable law.  You can ask for a copy of such appropriate data transfer agreements by contacting us as set out at the bottom of this notice.  Data Retention.  We generally retain personal data for as long as needed for the specific business purpose or purposes for which it was collected. In some cases, we may be required to retain personal data for a longer period of time based on laws or regulations that apply to our business or for other necessary business purposes. Where possible, we aim to anonymize the information or remove unnecessary identifiers from records that we may need to keep for periods beyond the original retention period.  Data Subject Rights.  Under the conditions set out under applicable law (i.e., the GDPR), you have the following rights:

Right of access: You have the right to obtain from us confirmation as to whether your personal data is being processed, and, where that is the case, to request access to the personal data. The access information includes, among other things, the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the personal data have been or will be disclosed. You have the right to obtain a copy of the personal data undergoing processing.
Right to rectification: You have the right to obtain from us the rectification of inaccurate personal data concerning you. Depending on the purposes of the processing, you have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.
Right to erasure: You have the right to ask us to erase your personal data to the extent it is not required for legally required purposes.
Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to request restriction of processing of your personal data, in which case, it would be marked and processed by us only for certain purposes.
Right to data portability: You have the right to receive your personal data which you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and you have the right to transmit the personal data to another entity without hindrance from us.







Right to object: You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to the processing of your personal data by us and we can be required to no longer process your personal data. In general, you have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  If you have a right to object and you exercise this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes by us. Exercising this right will not incur any cost. Such a right to object may not exist, in particular, if the processing of your personal data is necessary to take steps prior to entering into a contract or to perform a contract already concluded.
 





Right to Submit Complaints: You have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

Your Choices.  Having a business relationship with us and receiving our marketing communications are voluntary.  Please note that we cannot effectively do business with you or provide you with our marketing communications without processing some personal data about you such as your contact information.  Profiling. We do not engage in automated decision-making, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.  We may engage in profiling activities for marketing-related purposes.  In particular, we may use automated means to process personal data collected directly from you or obtained from public resources such as company, university and publications websites to help us identify products and services that we believe you may be interested in, and help us deliver relevant advertisements to you.
