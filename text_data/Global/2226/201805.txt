We use the information we collect from you to personalize your experience, to improve our web site and product offerings, to keep our websites safe and secure, to recommend products to you, to improve customer service, to process transactions you initiate, and to administer contests, promotions, surveys, and other marketing campaigns.
At times Faithlife may make certain personal information available to strategic partners. We only work with reputable partners who will respect your communication preferences.
All our email subscriptions include clear instructions for unsubscribing. You may choose to unsubscribe from emails sent for marketing purposes or to tell you about new products.
Even if you unsubscribe, we may send you occasional one-time emails about your account. Emails are sent after you make a purchase (as receipts, and with instructions on downloading, etc.), to provide important technical/support information about our products, etc.
Agency
In certain transactions (particularly purchases of electronic books from some publishers) we are acting as an agent for the publisher, who is the seller in the transaction. When we act as the agent of another party in a financial transaction, the transaction is between you and the seller, and we may provide your order details to the seller.

These companies may use information (not including your name, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, or billing information) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide you with a more customized user experience.
