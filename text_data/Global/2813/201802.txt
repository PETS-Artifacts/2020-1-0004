Cookies (Information Collected for Tracking and Customization)
A cookie is a small amount of information given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the information on your computer. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a Web page from the server. Cookies contain bits of information that facilitate the processing of Web pages and Web forms. A cookie can be used for authenticating, session tracking, and remembering specific information about users, such as site preferences or the contents of their electronic shopping carts. NSIDC collects this information to improve service to you.
NSIDC utilizes two types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies enable the processing of a Web page request and contact forms. Session cookies are temporary and they expire when you close your browser. NSIDC utilizes persistent cookies to enable our Web applications to preserve your information for future repeat visits. NSIDC sets persistent cookies to expire and be deleted after two weeks.
