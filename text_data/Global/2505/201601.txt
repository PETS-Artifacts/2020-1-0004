A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you\'ve visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. A cookie can\'t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times customers are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those customers are.

We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your member ID.
