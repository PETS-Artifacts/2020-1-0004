If you read the Gutenberg web site, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general. Server logs are automatically and irretrievably deleted, after a short time.
Specifically, all usage of www.gutenberg.org or any domain in PGLAF.org is intended to be anonymous.  Your name, or any other identifying information, is never requested. However, your IP address and requests from that address are retained, temporarily, by our servers, for analysis of Web site traffic, quality assurance, and aggregate reporting.  Note that Project Gutenberg does not control any mirrors except those at www.gutenberg.org and any domain in PGLAF.org, and those mirrors might have different procedures.

Uses of Cookies and Captchas
In order to assure the site is available for human users, not robots or third-party sites, this site uses cookies, captchas, and related techniques to apply our Terms of Use.  See the Terms of Use for alternate means to acquire Project Gutenberg content and metadata (i.e., mirrors, offline catalogs, and OPDS) if you cannot abide by these techniques.

Wiki Authors
If you contribute to the Project Gutenberg Wiki, you are publishing every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages and talk pages.

Links to Third Party Websites
This includes Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and maybe more.
Project Gutenberg does link to third party sites wherever users have come to expect this. Many of those sites are notorious wholesale collectors of private data, and it has been reported that such data are freely shared with national spy organizations and others.
However, we are very careful to link in a manner that does not allow those third party websites to see what you are doing on Project Gutenberg unless you explicitly click on one of those links. If you click on a third party link, you will leave the Project Gutenberg website, and we cannot tell you what the other site will do with your data.
