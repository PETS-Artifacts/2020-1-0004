Like most websites, we employ “cookies” or similar technologies on certain pages of our Websites. Cookies make the use of our Websites easier by, among other things, saving your preferences. We may also use cookies to deliver content tailored to your interests. Our cookies may enable us to relate your use of our Websites to personally identifying information that you previously submitted.

Session cookies: These temporary cookies expire and are automatically erased whenever you close your browser window. We use session cookies to grant our users access to content and to enable actions such as remembering items in your shopping cart when you shop on our Websites.
Persistent cookies: These usually have an expiration date in the distant future and remain in your browser until they expire or you manually delete them.

These third parties may collect information about a user’s online activities over time and across different websites when he or she uses our Websites. For example, we may use a third party tool to analyze usage patterns of the Websites.  Such a tool may generate a cookie to capture information about your use of the Websites which the third party provider uses to compile reports on website activity for us and to provide other related services.  The third party provider may use a portion of your IP address to identify its cookie, but this will not be associated with any other data held by the third party provider. 
We may also permit third party service providers to place cookies through our Websites, as indicated above, to perform analytic or marketing functions where you are notified of them and you have consented to the usage.   We do not control the use of such third party cookies or the resulting information and we are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.]
