Introduction
We at ENGINEERING.com, Inc. ("ENGINEERING.com") are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need to protect any personal identification information ("Personal Information") you share with us. Accordingly, ENGINEERING.com has established this Online Privacy Policy. 
Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify you, including, but not limited to, your first and last name, your home or work address and an email address or other contact information. We have designed ENGINEERING.com's Web pages in such a way that you can visit most public areas without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. 
ENGINEERING.com strives to comply with relevant privacy legislation around the world. Our goal is to provide protection for your Personal Information regardless of where that Personal Information is collected or stored. 
Tracking your site visits
Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A "cookie" is a small text file that may be used to collect information about Web site activity. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them.

Tracking your subscriber information
We collect Personal Information supplied by our users who register or who choose to provide their profile data to access certain areas or information on ENGINEERING.com.  This profile data allows us to better match our content to the needs of our audience.  For example, if your engineering specialty is “mechanical” you will be more likely to be presented with content that is specifically aimed at mechanical engineers.  ENGINEERING.com is a free service that is supported by advertising revenue so we also use this data to better match advertisements and promotions to our audience. 
If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Information within ENGINEERING.com, to ENGINEERING.com's third-party service providers as required, and to advertisers whose information you have viewed.  Transferring this information may mean that your data travels across borders.

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to ENGINEERING.com. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of ENGINEERING.com's Web pages, but you may be unable to access certain pages and the services that they contain.
Security

Where we collect Personal Information from you on the Web, our goal is to provide a means of contacting ENGINEERING.com should you need to update or correct that Information.
Third Party Services
It is against ENGINEERING.com's policy to sell Personal Information collected online without consent.
