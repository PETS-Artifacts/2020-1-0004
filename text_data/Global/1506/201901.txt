            that delivers the information, resources and services that are helpful to you. In order to achieve this
            goal, we may collect information from you. This policy describes how personally identifiable and anonymous
            information about our publication subscribers, online media product users and event registrants may be
            collected and shared.
Please be sure to read this Privacy Policy before using any Endeavor Business Media
            Web Site or submitting information through a Site. By using any of our Web Sites, you consent to our use of
            your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy and accept the terms and conditions herein.
This Privacy Policy is current as of the date written above. If we change our
            privacy practices, we will also update this Privacy Policy. Users should review this policy periodically to
            monitor any changes. Your continued use of our sites and services constitutes your acceptance of this
            entire Privacy Policy, as updated from time to time. Endeavor Business Media reserves the right to access
            and disclose personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with applicable laws, lawful
            government requests and any orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.
How does Endeavor Business Media collect your information?
Endeavor Business Media uses cookies and other internet technologies in the
            management of our Web Site and email programs in an effort to enrich your online experience. We may also
            use IP addresses to gather broad geographic information for aggregate use. Our cookies do not contain any
            information that is personally identifiable. Like many Web Sites, Endeavor Business Media may use pixel
            tags, also known as web beacons, clear gifs, or web bugs. Pixel tags help us improve our understanding of
            our web traffic and visitor behavior, as well as gauge the response to our promotional efforts. If you
            wish, you may disable pixel tags by setting your browser to omit images and disable JavaScript.
We use industry-standard, third party advertising service companies to serve
            advertisements when you visit our Sites or open our emails. These companies may use cookies, pixel tags,
            and other methods to collect information about your visit to our Web Site, and others, in order to provide
            you with relevant advertisements about products, services, and events. These collection methods do not
            typically include your name, address, or telephone number. These elements also provide us with aggregate
            pictures of traffic patterns, which help us to improve your site experience and monitor advertising effort
When is personally identifiable information collected? How is
            your information used?
Endeavor Business Media collects personally identifiable information that you choose
            to provide us when you subscribe to our magazines, sign up for e-newsletters, enter a contest, participate
            in surveys, login into our Web Sites using a third party login system (including, but not limited to,
            Facebook Connect, Twitter, etc.), register for a Web Site, webcast, or trade show, or otherwise communicate
            with us. When you provide this information to us, you are no longer anonymous. Endeavor Business Media does
            not take any steps to protect the privacy of information you volunteer about yourself in public forums or
            other publicly accessible sections of our Web Sites.

We may use your contact information to send notices for subscription renewal or
            provide you with information about products or services you have ordered with us. We may also use your
            contact information to send you e-newsletters or other promotional e-mails that contain targeted, relevant
            content that may be useful to your business. All promotional e-mails you receive from us will include an
            option to opt out of similar e-mail communications in the future.

We may include personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be
            uniquely identified with you) such as your name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and e-mail address, as
            well as “demographic” information such as the type of business you work for, your job responsibilities and
            certain information about your company. We will tell you at the time we collect information whether the
            information requested is necessary for you to participate in a particular feature. The information we
            collect is used to respond to your specific requests, to send you periodic information and special offers
            from Endeavor Business Media and our sponsors, to provide you with updates on Endeavor Business Media
            offerings and features, to provide you with product information from manufacturers in our database, and to
            provide our sponsors and business partners with data about our users. 

We may disclose aggregated information about users and information that does not
            identify any individual, without restriction. We also reserve the right to disclose your Personal
            Information if we are required to do so by law, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of the
            information is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process, to respond to claims, or to protect or
            advance the rights, property, safety, or well-being of our company, our employees, customers, or the
            public. In the unlikely event that all of Endeavor Business Media’s assets or substantially all of its
            assets are acquired, then customer information, which may include Personal Information, may be one of the
            transferred assets.

How does Endeavor Business Media secure and store your
            information?
We use reasonable precautions, including appropriate technical, administrative, and
            physical procedures, to try to protect collected personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration.
Many of our Web Sites contain links to Web Sites owned and operated by unaffiliated
            third parties. These links are provided as a service to you, and do not constitute Endeavor Business
            Media's endorsement or support of those third parties or their Web Sites. Each third party Web Site has its
            own information collection and use practices, and we advise you to review their policies.
Endeavor Business Media is not responsible or liable for third party privacy
            practices or the content of third party sites. We are not responsible or liable for any breach of security
            or for the actions of these parties.
Due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside our control, we cannot
            guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third
            parties. Any information you provide may be stored and maintained in a Endeavor Business Media database,
            either housed at Endeavor Business Media or with a third party vendor. In the case of a sale, change of
            ownership or merger involving Endeavor Business Media or any parent, subsidiary or affiliated company, your
            information may be transferred to a third party.

Passwords may be used by a Site to protect your personal data. We recommend that you
            do not share your passwords with anyone, and notify us promptly if you believe your password security has
            been breached. Endeavor Business Media will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or
            in an unsolicited e-mail. Also, if you are using a computer that others have access to, such as one in a
            computer lab, Internet cafe or public library, always remember to log out and close your browser window
            when leaving any of our Sites. In addition, any personally identifiable information or sensitive data that
            you disclose through any discussion boards or other public online forums hosted on the Sites may be
            collected and used by others. We recommend caution when giving out personal information to others in these
            public online forums. When you provide information on these forums, you do so at your own risk. The
            information you share may be viewed by any other user of the Sites.

We will retain your personal information and any information collected from your
            use of our Web Sites for as long as you are a Subscriber or otherwise maintain a user account on our Web
            Sites and for a reasonable time thereafter.

            information you provide us. To exercise control over your information, we have provided you with the

            before we received your request.

            unsubscribed from receiving advertising and promotional material from Endeavor Business Media, you will
            continue to receive transactional information from us, such as information relating to your account or
            payment or bill information. If you receive broadcast e-mail messages that we may send about third party
            manufacturers in whose products or services we believe you may be interested, and no longer wish to receive
