At CAS, your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. That is why when you visit CAS websites, we inform you through this Privacy Statement that CAS takes measures to keep the data on our sites secure. We also help you maintain control over personal data you have submitted to CAS. 
CAS only asks for specific types of personal information. 
In a few areas on our websites and online customer support tools, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your visit. It is completely optional for you to provide this information to CAS. 
For example, we request information from you when you: 

Register to use CAS or STNÂ® products or services; 
Place an order; 
Provide feedback in an online survey; 
Participate in a promotional offer or contest; 
Request an email notification; 
Subscribe to a newsletter, mailing list, etc.; or 
Request online technical support. 

In each of the instances above, we may ask you for your name, email address, phone number, address, and type of business as well as other similar personal information that is needed for you to register or subscribe to services or offers. If we ever ask you for significantly different information we will inform you. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. 
CAS will not disclose your personal information to any outside organization for its use without your consent. 
Information regarding you (such as name, address, and phone number) or your order and the products and services that you purchase will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of CAS for the purpose of performing services or providing support for CAS. 
CAS wants to help you keep your personal information accurate. 
You may have factual inaccuracies in personal information you have submitted to CAS corrected by contacting help@cas.org. 
Customized Experience 
New technologies are emerging on the Internet that help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At CAS, we primarily use cookies to help us keep track of online transactions, to provide you with access to third-party content, and to establish statistics about site usage. For example, by setting a cookie on a CAS website, you will not have to login in a password more than once, which saves you time. The cookie also keeps track of your transaction by "maintaining state" while you are using an online application such as STN Easy. CAS does not make available to other organizations any of the information in your CAS cookies. 
Please be aware that certain functions of the CAS websites may depend upon cookies being accepted. 
Third-Party Sites 
Please note that other websites that may be accessed through our sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party websites are not addressed by this Privacy Statement. 
Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online and do not share your CAS passwords or account information with others. While at CAS we strive to protect your personal information, CAS cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 
Log Files 
CAS uses log files containing IP addresses to administer our sites, trace users' movement through our sites, gather basic demographic information for aggregate use, and analyze general use of our sites. 
Security 
CAS websites have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. For security reasons we cannot provide information on the various measures and controls we have in place to protect your information. 
Correct/Update and Choice/Opt-Out 
This site gives users two options for changing and modifying information previously provided as noted in 1) and 2) below.
