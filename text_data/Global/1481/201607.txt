This is the official Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) for www.bet.com (the “Site”) and all mobile applications owned and operated by Black Entertainment Television LLC (collectively, the Site and such mobile applications are referred to herein as “BET.com”).  Black Entertainment Television LLC (also referred to herein as “BET”, “we”, “us” or “our”), is a subsidiary of Viacom International Inc. (“Parent Company”).  We have adopted and implemented this Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to protecting our users’ Personal Information and Other Information (as those terms are defied below) from misuse.
This Privacy Policy governs only the Personal Information and Other Information (together referred to herein as “Information”) collected through the Site and does not cover any such information collected in any other manner or by any other website offered by BET, Parent Company and/or any subsidiaries and affiliates of Parent Company (collectively, “Affiliates”) or collected by any other company, unless specifically stated.  We may from time to time combine Information with other information we collect from other sources, such as information received from Parent Company, Affiliates, marketing companies or third-party advertisers and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.
The phrase “Personal Information” as used in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement means any information such as a user’s full name, street address, town or city, state, zip code, telephone number, date of birth, email address and any other Sensitive Personal Information or personally identifiable information that would allow someone to identify or contact a Site user. Your credit card or debit card number is classified as “Sensitive Personal Information.”

The Site is offered and made available only to users 13 years of age or older who reside in the United States of America; however, certain features and functions may be limited to persons in older age groups (e.g. 21 and over). If you are not yet 13 years old (or the requisite age for a certain feature or function on the Site), or do not reside in the United States, or if you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy for any reason, please discontinue using the Site immediately. By using this Site, you certify that you are at least 13 years of age (or the requisite age for a certain feature or function on the Site), reside in the United States and agree to the terms and conditions below
This Privacy Policy applies whether you are accessing the Site via a personal computer, a mobile or wireless device, mobile application or any other technology or devices now known or hereafter developed or discovered (each, a “Device”) and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user or other user of the Site. This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular feature or function offered through the Site terminates, expires, ceases or is deactivated for any reason
BET reserves the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason and reserves the right to make changes at any time to any of the information contained in this Privacy Policy.

2.  United States Jurisdiction; Safe Harbor

If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and Switzerland, for detailed information on our privacy policy and practices with respect to personal information transferred from the EEA and Switzerland, please see our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy located at http://www.viacom.com/privacypolicy/Documents/VIACOM-610657-v1-Safe_Harbor_Policy.pdf.  

If you are located outside of the U.S., the EEA and Switzerland, you use this Site at your own risk and initiative and you, not us, are responsible for compliance with any applicable local and national laws.  Please be aware that any Personal Information and Other Information you provide to us or we obtain as a result of your use of this Site will be collected in the U.S. and/or transferred to the U.S. and subject to U.S. law.  By using this Site, participating in any Site activities and/or providing us with your Personal Information and Other Information, you (i) consent to the transfer and/or processing of any Information to and in the U.S., (ii) acknowledge that U.S. law may provide a lower standard of protection for personal data than the laws of your location and (iii) understand that we will collect, transfer, store, process and/or deal with your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and U.S. law. 

3.  Storage of Personal Information.
Your continued use of the Site indicates your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and of the collection, use, disclosure, management and storage of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information as described below. We may from time to time, transfer or merge any Personal Information collected offline to our databases or store offline information in an electronic format. We may also combine Personal Information we collect online with information available from other sources, including information received from third party advertisers, business, partners, sponsors, promotional partners (collectively referred to as “Advertisers”), and our Affiliates. This Privacy Policy covers all such Personal Information and will remain in full force and effect as long as you are a user of the Site and for a reasonable period thereafter, even if your use of or participation in any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. Please note that we may engage third party service providers to store information on their databases on behalf of BET.

4.  Information BET Collects.
Some functions, mobile applications or promotions, as well as some areas of BET.com, require users to register before they can use or access a particular area of the Site (which may be necessary for identification, security, or marketing purposes, etc.). BET.com’s registration, online surveys, contest entry forms, mobile applications and specialized services may call for users to provide Personal Information and demographic information (like their age or income level). Additionally, BET.com’s registration process requires users to choose a unique User ID and password. Users may change his or her password, as well as any Personal Information provided to us, to keep his or her registration information current.

To the extent that we offer online sales or shopping services, if you order any of our products, in addition to your name and contact information, we will also collect and maintain certain Sensitive Personal Information, including your credit card or other payment instrument information, billing address, shipping address, product selections, your order number, and information about your computer’s Internet address and website which may have referred or directed you to the Site (e.g., the referring URL).

5.  Use of Personal and Other Information. 
 BET’s primary goal in collecting Personal Information is to provide the user with a customized experience on our Site. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to our users. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements. By knowing a little about users, BET is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to our users.
We may use Personal Information from our online registration, surveys, contests, mobile applications, specialized services, and order forms for our own internal evaluation and tracking purposes and to send our users information from our company (e.g., site announcements, newsletters, and message notifications) and promotional material from some of our business partners (or from other companies).
a.  If you supply such Personal Information, it may also be used to:
·         Contact you about products and services in which you have indicated an interest, and may be shared with Advertisers or other companies who may want to contact you, if you have provided your consent through an “opt-in” (in which case their use of your Personal Information is subject to such third party’s privacy policy and terms of use) (you may opt-out of receiving future mailings by using the “opt-out” procedures described below - see the Choice/Opt-Out section below);

·         Accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information in connection with the Site and user activity;

6.  Information Collected Through Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies. 
“Cookies” are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and often referred to as browser cookies) that help store information, user preferences and/or user activity. “Web beacons” (also known as image tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of code used to collect data, such as counting page views, promotion views or advertising responses.  Flash local shared objects (sometimes known as “Flash cookies” and used if Adobe Flash is used) are text or other files that help store user preferences and/or activity.   The Site and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web beacons”, Flash cookies, and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, “Tracking Technologies”) to collect Other Information automatically as you browse the Site and the web.
We use Tracking Technologies to help tailor our content, allow users to move between associated sites without logging into each site, understand Site and internet usage, improve or customize the content, offerings or advertisements on this Site, personalize your experience on this Site (for example, to recognize you by name when you return to the Site), understand your interactions with email messages (such as the links clicked on and whether the messages were opened or forwarded), save your password in password-protected areas, save your online game or video player settings, enable you to use shopping carts on the Site, help us offer you products, programs or services that may be of interest to you, deliver relevant advertising, maintain and administer the Site and for other purposes described in the “Use of Personal and Other Information” section above.  These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site (such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, use of our features and purchasing history or preferences), may collect such Other Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other websites offered by Parent Company and/or Affiliates and may also collect your IP address or some other identifier unique to the Device you use to access the Site (“Identifier”).  An Identifier is automatically assigned to any Device you use to access the Site.  Your Personal Information is not collected as part of this process but we may associate Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies with Personal Information.  

By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. 

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, “Third Party Service Providers”) to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site (“Targeting Services”).  These Third Party Service Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited.  Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. See Section 4(b)(i) for more information on this Site’s use of Nielsen’s proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.

These Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site.  The Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device if you choose to have Tracking Technologies enabled in your browser (or, for Flash cookies, if you have not removed them) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.

7.  Public Forums.
BET.com may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, personal webpages or other social networking or messaging features and/or news groups available to its users and, in certain cases, information contained in anonymous user profiles may be displayed on and shared with affiliated websites. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information, even without your consent. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information because you don’t know who might access or attempt to use your posted Personal Information. BET is in no way responsible for the accuracy, use, or misuse of any information (including Personal Information) that you disclose or receive through these venues.

8.  Choice/Opt-Out.
a.  Opting Out of Certain Uses of Personal Information

b.  Opting Out of Use of Certain Other Information Collected by tracking Technologies

i.    Tracking Technologies Set By Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, you have a number of options:

·         Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising tailored to your interests.

·         You can opt-out of the use of Other Information for these advertising purposes by two such Third Party Service Providers, Adobe AudienceManager (formerly known as Demdex) and DoubleClick/Google, by using those Third Party Service Providers’ opt-out tools.  You can access Adobe Audience Manager/Demdex’s tool at http://www.donottarget.com/ and DoubleClick’s tool at http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/ or as described in the next bullet point.

·         We also may from time to time permit other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to collect Other Information on the Site.  Some of these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative’s Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices. 

·         Please note the following with respect to opting out:

o   The opt-out tools discussed above are “cookie based.”  This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices with respect to the use of your information by the parties that offer you those choices.  If you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser (a process described below) after opting out, you may have to opt out again to re-establish your opt-out preferences. 

o   Opt-outs are “browser-specific.”  The opt-out preferences that you choose will apply only to the Web browser that you used when you selected these preferences.  This means, for example, that if you opt-out while using Internet Explorer 9, this choice will not affect the use of Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device.  It also means that opting-out on one Device will not affect the use of Other Information by Tracking Technologies on other Devices that you may use to access the Site.  

·         You also can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) on a particular Device by using the controls in your Web browser.  To do so, you must:

o   Delete existing Tracking Technologies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature; and

o   Disable future Tracking Technologies through the same browser controls.  Additional information on enabling or disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)

·         You can choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings.  This is done through your browser on the Device you use to access the Site.  Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.

·         Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies does not mean that you will no longer receive online ads.  Opting-out of, deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Third Party Service Providers’ Tracking Technologies only means that such ads will no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you will continue to see ads on this Site.

·         PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH COOKIES TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR BROWSER.  PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR INFORMATION ON HOW TO MANAGE FLASH COOKIES. 

ii.   Tracking Technologies Set By the Site.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:

·         You can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies (other than Flash cookies) by using the controls in your Web browser.  To do so, you must:

o   Delete existing Tracking Technologies through the “Internet Options” sub-option of the “Tools” menu option of your browser or otherwise as directed by your browser’s support feature; and

o   Disable future Tracking Technologies through the same browser controls.  Additional information on enabling or disabling most Tracking Technologies may be available through your browser’s support feature.  (See the “help” section of your browser for more information.)

·         You can choose to have the Device you use to access the Site warn you each time a cookie or most other Tracking Technologies is being set (other than Flash cookies), or you can choose to turn off such warnings.  This is done through your browser on the Device you use to access the Site.  Additional information on warnings and removal of warnings may be available through your browser’s support feature.

This Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Click here for more information about this Site and online behavioral advertising.

Some Device manufacturers may preset their browsers to block Tracking Technologies from websites other than those you visit directly and, if so, certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices.  Further, if you delete, reject, disable or turn off Tracking Technologies, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.
iii.  Flash Cookies.  Please note that deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options will not remove Flash cookies.  For more information about Flash cookies and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.
iv.  Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. 
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in Sections 8(b)(i), (ii) and (iii).
9.  Children/Ineligible Teenagers.
BET.com is a general audience site. We do not direct any of our content specifically at children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. If a parent or guardian believes that BET.com collected Personal Information from a child, please see the Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information Section.

In the event that we or our Parent Company, subsidiaries or Affiliates, unknowingly send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of certain features of this Site (“Ineligible Teenagers”), the child or Ineligible Teenager or the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s parent or legal guardian (“Parents”) always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message. The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state).

Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership must use their child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID to gain direct access to the account and follow the procedures below. To terminate a child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s membership, Parents may send an email to the Site’s Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com and provide us with your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID and request to terminate your child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. We will not allow direct access to a user’s account and Personal Information by any person without the user’s User ID. If a Parent does not have his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s User ID, the Parent will be required to send an email to the Privacy Administrator at legal@bet.com that includes the Parent’s name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s date of birth. The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that he or she is the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. BET.com will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account and registration. The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address. BET.com will then terminate the child’s or Ineligible Teenager’s account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.

BET will not use a wireless telephone number or email address, or other Personal Information submitted for its wireless marketing services for any other purpose but to provide the service requested, unless we provide advance notice of any other use or as stated in the Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement.

We will share such Personal Information with the Operational Service Providers (defined below) that assist us in delivering these wireless services to you and with our Parent Company, subsidiaries, and Affiliates.
12.  Accuracy and Confidentiality.
It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date.

You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your User ID, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities and losses we incur or may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, and not us, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use and conduct on the Site and for any use of the Site or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Site, by any others who use your User ID, unless and until you notify us that your User ID may have been compromised, misappropriated or improperly taken or used by another party. We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. Bear in mind that when you submit information to us, it does not guarantee that we will permit you to use any or all of the features or functions of the Site.

13.  Privacy of Your Postings.
We respect the privacy of the contents of any Personal Information related to or contained in a Submission, unless the information is intended to be disclosed (such Personal Information, except as intended to be disclosed, is called “Confidential Personal Information”). However, we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Site or Confidential Personal Information to a third party, if we believe such action is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce this Privacy Policy or the terms of the Terms of Use Agreement, or to protect the interests of our users, Advertisers, Parent Company, subsidiaries, Affiliates, licensors, suppliers, Operational Service Providers, and others.

Further, if you use any of the interactive or community features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in such space, as you do not know who will access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes.

14.  Disclosure to Third Parties.
Generally we do not sell, rent, lease or disclose Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our Advertisers, except as stated herein or in the Terms of Use Agreement. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to Advertisers, we ask for you to opt-in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the Advertisers’ own privacy policies and terms of use. We may disclose Personal Information to our Parent Company, subsidiaries and Affiliates for marketing and/or administrative purposes and you have the right to opt-out of such disclosure for marketing purpose. For opt-out procedures, please see the Choice/Opt-out Section.

b. Operational Service Providers. In addition, BET.com may use third party service providers (“Operational Service Providers”), to perform functions on our behalf for the purpose of administering and maintaining certain social networking services, content, features, functions, and other operations of the Site. These service providers may also manage and store Site user information, including your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal information. Your voluntary use of, or registration for participation on the Site, means that you opt-in and give your consent to both BET and its authorized agents or third party service providers to collect and use your Personal Information in connection with providing the services, content, features, functions, and other operations provided on the Site, as well as for marketing or administrative purposes. We use Operational Service Providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your information to our Operational Service Providers for the purposes of providing services to us

·         If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, (i) to protect BET or our Parent Company, subsidiaries, Affiliates, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers and other users and our security, business, property and/or assets, (ii) to limit legal liability, (iii) to defend our interests and/or (iv) to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations or requests by law enforcement agencies or governmental authorities; or

15.  Security & Protection of Personal Information.
 We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. For most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, BET cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk.

16.  Review, Update or Delete Your Personal Information.
 Generally, you may review, update or delete your Personal Information collected by the Site. You may also correct factual inaccuracies. However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information. Deletion or attempted deletion of certain Personal Information, such as your user name, may not be permitted and/or may result in suspension of your account or termination of any registration you may have made.  Personal Information collected for certain entries are subject to corporate and regulatory record-keeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user’s request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.

Children under the age of 13 that are unknowingly registered on the Site are in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement. Parents (including legal guardians) of children that registered on the Site in violation of the Terms of Use Agreement who wish to terminate their child’s membership must follow the steps for termination set forth in the section entitled Children/Ineligible Teenagers.

See the “Posts and Submissions” section of the Terms of Use for how registered users of this Site who are California residents and are under 18 years of age may request removal of content or Information in such users’ postings of content on the Site. 

We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user’s account or any services, features or functions. And, if the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.
