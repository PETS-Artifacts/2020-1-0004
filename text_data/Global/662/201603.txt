About this site
This website is owned and provided by the New Zealand Parliamentary Counsel Office/Te Tari Tohutohu Pāremata (PCO), which is responsible for drafting and publishing most of New Zealand's legislation.
Linking  to this website
The Parliamentary Counsel Office welcomes and encourages linking to this   website. Links can be made freely and without seeking permission.   Please copy and paste the  following code into your HTML:
<a href="http://www.legislation.govt.nz">New Zealand Legislation website</a>

Note that, while links to Acts, to Legislative Instruments, and to Other Instruments information pages are stable, each new version of a Bill will have a new URL.
Accessibility
Go to the List of Access Keys.
The  New Zealand Legislation website is  designed to comply with the 
   New  Zealand Government Web Accessibility and Usability Standards, allowing the content to be usable by all, irrespective of physical or technological impediments.
Some items of legislation are large, particularly the View whole or PDF versions, and may be slow to download.
The final form and content of legislation is a matter for Parliament   or, in the case of Legislative Instruments, the person or body responsible for   making the Legislative Instruments.  There are therefore some instances where the Parliamentary Counsel Office is unable to publish  legislation (including Bills and Supplementary Order Papers) in a form   that fully complies with the Standards.
Alternative text (or alt text) for images, and table summaries are added routinely to legislation when it is first published, or when it is reprinted. However, this information may not be provided for legislation that was published or most recently reprinted before 11 April 2015.
Alt text is a brief summary provided for graphics within HTML documents. Table summaries describe the structure of a table. Both are  intended for screen reading technology and are invisible to the general website user. Neither form part of the legislation, they have no legal effect, and are provided for information only. 
If you come across any accessibility issues, please Contact us.

Disclaimer
This website provides official and unofficial legislation. Official  legislation displays the New Zealand Coat of Arms on the front page. PDFs  without the New Zealand Coat of Arms, and HTML versions that do not display the  New Zealand Coat of Arms at the top of their View whole versions, are not official. If legislation is not  official it should not be relied on as the authoritative text.
See Status of legislation on this website: what is official for more information.
Website aids provided within legislation, such as links between and  within legislation, alt text (brief summaries provided for graphics within HTML  documents, intended for screen reading technology), and table summaries (which describe  the structure of the table, intended for screen reading technology), do not  form part of the legislation, have no legal effect, and are provided for  information only and should not be relied upon as authoritative.
 Although the Parliamentary Counsel Office endeavours to create particular  links within and between legislation on the website, it will not always be  possible to do so.
 Note that in the case of Other Instruments, only links to the websites  on which they are located are provided on this website, rather than the Other  Instruments themselves. The Parliamentary Counsel Office relies on information  received from agencies responsible for administering Other Instruments. Because  of this, the Parliamentary Counsel Office does not assume responsibility for  the accuracy or completeness of the links provided. For advice about particular  Other Instruments, contact the agency responsible for administering them.
Supplementary material on this website is intended to provide general  information to the public, and every effort has been made to ensure that the  material is accurate and up to date. However, the Parliamentary Counsel Office  may change, delete, add to, or otherwise amend information contained on this  website at any time.
This website links to the Parliamentary Counsel Office corporate website, which the Parliamentary Counsel Office is responsible for, and to the Disclosure statements website, which the Parliamentary Counsel Office shares joint responsibility for with the Treasury. The Parliamentary Counsel Office is not responsible for the content   or reliability of other websites linked to from this website and does not   necessarily endorse the  views expressed within them. Linking is not to be taken as endorsement   of any kind. We cannot guarantee that these links will work all of the   time and we have no  control over availability of the linked pages.
