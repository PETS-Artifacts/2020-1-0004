Use of Google Products
We use Google Universal (GUA) for tracking and reporting Site activity. GUA collects information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit on the Site, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. This allows us to better understand our users and to optimize their digital experience.  We use the Google User ID features to associate data from the different devices and multiple sessions of users and we may stitch together session data from unauthenticated user visits with authenticated user visits to give us a more accurate count of our Site users in order to improve Site usage data. We use data from the Google Display Network with GUA for demographic and interest reports to better understand and serve our audience.  We may connect GUA data with data from our registered user database to understand the usage and needs of our registered users. Google prohibits the transmission of personally identifiable information to GUA, and we will not transmit any such information to GUA.
We use Google’s AdWords and Remarketing features to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website.
