What Type of Information Does DvF Collect?
We collect two types of information: (1) Personal Information, such as name and address collected through the Website and in stores; and (2) Non-Personal Information, such as your IP address or cookies collected through the Website. 
Personal Information
"Personal Information" is information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, or email address. DvF collects and stores the Personal Information that you have provided to us. Here are some examples of manners in which we may collect your Personal Information: 

•	We may collect your first and last name, date of birth, and email address if you register with the Website; 
•	We may collect your first and last name, e-mail address, and country of residence if you sign up to receive online newsletters; 
•	We may collect your name, address, month of birth, phone number, and e-mail address if you complete a Dialogue Card in one of our stores; 
•	We may collect your first and last name, date of birth and email address if you choose to participate in a contest or sweepstakes; and
•	We may collect your first and last name, telephone number, address, and your credit card and billing information if you make a purchase of a product. 
The above list provides an example of the Personal Information that we collect. If you do not want DvF to collect your Personal Information please do not provide it to us. 
Non-Personal Information
"Non-Personal Information" can be technical information or it can be demographic information, such as your age, gender or interests. Non-Personal Information does NOT identify you personally. Here are some examples of the Non-Personal Information that is collected via the Website and a description of how this information is used: 

•	Internet Protocol (IP) address – Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data – such as the webpages you view. We use this information to deliver our webpages to you upon request, to tailor our Website to the interests of our users and to measure traffic within our Website.
•	Cookie – A “cookie” is a small text file that may be used to collect information about your activity on the Website. For example, when someone visits a page within the Website, a cookie is placed on the user’s machine (if the user accepts cookies) or is read if the user has visited the Website previously. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other users to our Website. 
•	Beacons (also known as “clear gifs,” “web bugs” or “pixel tags”) – “Web Beacons” are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Website and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages. 
•	Demographic Information – “Demographic Information” may be your gender, age, zip code and interests, which you voluntarily provide to us on the Website. 
•	Google Analytics — To help facilitate the delivery of relevant content, we use Google Analytics and have implemented all Google Advertising Features, including Remarketing, Impression Reporting, and Demographics, and Interest Reporting. Google Analytics uses cookies to report on user interactions on our and others’ websites. We use the data collected for optimizing marketing, refining advertising and/or programming strategies, and generally making advertising more effective. Google provides a complete privacy policy and instructions on opting out of Google Analytics here: http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html 
We use this information to provide you with personalized services and to analyze trends to ensure the information provided by the Website meets your needs. Please note that we also consider aggregated information, which is not personally identifiable, to be Non-Personal Information. The above list provides an example of the Non-Personal Information that is collected via the Website. 
Please note: from time to time, we may combine Personal Information with Non-Personal Information and when we do, for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we will refer to the combined data as “Personal Information”. 
This information is collected directly from you, as well as through third parties that you have authorized to provide such Personal Information, and, where permitted by local law, through publicly accessible sources such as social media. We also may obtain, collect and aggregate information (including Personal Information) from other sources, such as data brokers, marketing service providers, vendors, and other third parties.
How Do We Use Information We Collect on the Website and Why? 
Personal Information
We use Personal Information primarily for the following purposes: 

•	To alert you to special offers, updated information and other new products or items from DvF, or other third parties, or to forward promotional materials; 
•	complete a transaction or service requested by you; 
•	To fulfill the terms of a promotion; 
•	To ensure the Website and our services are relevant to your needs; 
•	To help us create and publish content most relevant to you; 
•	To notify you about a material change to this Privacy Policy, if necessary; 
•	To allow you access to limited-entry areas of the Website; 
•	To contact you in response to your request; 
•	In other manners as disclosed to you at the time of collection; 
•	To perform our obligations under a contract with you; and 
•	For certain automated decision-making activities, including serving online advertising, and/or generating a personality profile for you. For example, We engage in profiling based on your online browsing behavior, purchasing history, the information your provide us and other third parties. This means that we analyze all of this data to create a profile about your interests so we can tailor our marketing to you and deliver specific ads targeted to you. This means that you may not see certain ads that our algorithm deems irrelevant to you; conversely, you will receive ads that are based on the profile we have created about you. If the data we receive, have collected, or you have provided to us is inaccurate, this may affect the relevance of the ads that you receive and products/content you are served on the Website. Details of the Personal Information we collect, how it is used, and how you may opt out of any automated decision-making is explained below. 
Non-Personal Information
Non-Personal Information is used as described above and in other ways as permitted by applicable laws, including combining Non-Personal Information with Personal Information. 
Under What Circumstances May We Disclose or Share Information? 
We may share or disclose your Personal Information in the following instances: 

•	To complete your purchase. If you choose to make a purchase, we may collect from you your credit card number, billing address and other information related to such purchase, and we may use such collected information in order to fulfill your purchase. We may also provide such information, or other Personal Information provided by you, to unaffiliated third parties as necessary to complete your purchase (for example, to process your credit card). 
•	To fulfill a service to you. For example, if you ask us to provide you with additional information or to compare your purchased items with items available elsewhere, we may share your Personal Information in order to confirm your purchase and fulfill your request. In addition, if you email us a question, we may use your email address to process your request and respond to your question. Also, if you are entering a sweepstakes or contest, we may use your Personal Information in order to fulfill the terms of that promotion. This means that we may share the information for prize fulfillment purposes or mail carriers. We also may share your information with the co-sponsor of that promotion. 
•	To affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other unaffiliated parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of interest to you or who require your Personal Information for research, administrative and/or internal business purposes. These parties may use your Personal Information to contact you with an offer or advertisement related to a product or service, or they may use such information for their own research, administration or business purposes. If you do not want us to share your Personal Information in this manner, please do not provide us with this information. 
•	To unaffiliated third-party service providers, agents or independent contractors who help us maintain our Website and provide other administrative services to us (including, but not limited to, order processing and fulfillment, providing customer service, maintaining and analyzing data, sending customer communications on DvF’s behalf, and entry collection, winner selection and prize fulfillment for contests, sweepstakes and other promotions). We seek to ensure that these unaffiliated third parties will not use the Personal Information for any other purpose than to provide the administrative services for which they are responsible. Because such unaffiliated third-party service providers will have access to users’ Personal Information, if you do not wish for our unaffiliated third-party service providers to have access to your information, please do not register or submit any Personal Information to us. 
•	To comply with the law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of law or comply with legal process served on us, protect and defend our rights or property, including the rights and property of DvF, our Visitors or Registrants, or act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our end users. 
•	To third parties as part of any corporate reorganization process including, but not limited to, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of all or substantially all of our assets. 
•	To track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our Visitors, Registrants and customers and provide such information to third parties. 
•	To enforce the Terms of Use or to protect against potential fraud, we may verify with third parties the information collected. In the course of such verification, we may receive Personal Information about you from such services. In particular, if you use a credit card or debit card to purchase services with us, we may use card authorization and fraud screening services to verify that your card information and address matches the information that you supplied to us, and that the card has not been reported as lost or stolen. These card authorization and fraud screening services may use your Personal Information for their own purpose (i.e. beyond verifying your information or screening your transaction), including for analytics and to improve their fraud screening tools and services. 
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or at the time we request the information, we do not otherwise use, share or otherwise disclose your Personal Information to any third parties. 
Non-Personal Information
We use non-Personal Information collected on the Website in the manner disclosed above. We may share this non-Personal Information with third parties. 
Legal Bases of Our Collection and Processing
We only collect or process your data based on the following legal bases: 

•	Where the processing of your Personal Information is in our legitimate interests (such as to improve our products and services and the content of our websites, prevent fraud, and for administrative purposes as described in this Privacy Policy); 
•	When we perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, if you are a consumer we will use your Personal Information to carry out our obligations under the contract that we have with you); 
•	When we have a legal obligation to do so (for example, to comply with the law or respond to legal process or lawful requests, including from law enforcement and government agencies); or

In each such an event, the Personal Information we have collected from you may be one of the assets transferred. 
Do We Permit Individuals to Opt-Out of Receiving Communications from DvF? 
Yes.

You also may opt-out of receiving such emails by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link within the text of the email. 
That said, please note that we also communicate with Registrants and other Visitors on a regular basis via email. For example, we may use your email address to confirm your request, to send you notice of payments, to send you information about changes to our products and services, and to send notices and other disclosures as required by law. Generally, you cannot opt-out of these communications, but they will be primarily informational in nature rather than promotional.
