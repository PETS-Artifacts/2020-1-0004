Slantmagazine.com respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to Slantmagazine.com will be known only to two parties: you and Slantmagazine.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. Personal information includes your name, street, and email addresses, click-through activity, and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.
Traffic Data:
Each time a visitor comes to Slantmagazine.com, our server—like most on the Web—collects some basic technical information, including, for example, the visitor’s domain name (e.g., whether the user is logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to Slantmagazine.com), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform).
We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor’s activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g. tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within Slantmagazine.com, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify you or contact you.
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here.
Promotion:
From time to time, Slantmagazine.com may sponsor sweepstakes, contests, or other events which require the collection, processing, and storage of individual contact and demographic information (e.g., your age and state of residence) to be used for the event. Slantmagazine.com may also co-sponsor these events along with other companies, in which case the user’s individual contact and demographic information is likely to be shared with other participating sponsors, who may use this information as they wish. A registrant’s personal contact and demographic information will not be released to any third-party organization other than named sponsors without the user’s consent, and Slantmagazine.com will request that such named sponsors uphold the privacy of the registrants’ information by not distributing or sharing such information with any other businesses or organizations.
Surveys:
Slantmagazine.com will from time to time conduct voluntary surveys of visitors to the site to obtain aggregate demographic information about them. Such information may be compiled and shared in the aggregate with advertisers and other third parties, but no personal details will be traceable or associated with specific individuals.
Reader Mail:
From time to time, Slantmagazine.com will publish emails received from our readers, which may be edited for length and content. In order to protect your privacy, Slantmagazine.com will not publish your e-mail address nor will we sell, trade, or otherwise disclose your contact information to third parties.
Other Disclosure of Personal Information:
Slantmagazine.com will not otherwise use or disclose your personal information without your consent except (i) as described in this privacy policy, or (ii) as required by law, court order, or as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. This policy does not protect information you post to any online bulletin board, chat room, newsgroup, or other public forum within our website.
Other Sites:
Slantmagazine.com contains many links to other sites on the Web. We cannot control and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such other websites.
If you have any further questions or concerns about Slantmagazine.com’s privacy policies and use of personal information, please contact us.
