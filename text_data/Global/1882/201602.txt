What Cookies and Web Beacons Are and How We Use Them
Our Site may use various software technologies including “cookies”, “web beacons” and “pixel tags.” “Cookies are small text files that we place in visitors' computer browsers to store their preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any PII. "Web beacons" are small pieces of code placed on a web page to monitor the behavior and collect data about the visitors viewing a web page. For example, web beacons can be used to count the users who visit a web page or to deliver a cookie to the browser of a visitor viewing that page. We may use web beacons on our Site from time to time for this purpose. “Pixel tags” are a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking activity on websites, or tracking when emails are opened or accessed.
