TORY BURCH PRIVACY & USAGE POLICY
August 11, 2015

Introduction

Tory Burch LLC (together with its affiliates “Tory Burch”) values its customers and respects their privacy. This 
Privacy and Usage Policy applies to personal information that we collect about you in the United States, including but 
not limited to data collected through our websites, mobile applications (collectively the "website") and in 
our stores. This information is used to improve your shopping experience and to communicate with you about our 
products, services and promotions. Neither your name nor any of your personal information is sold to any other non-
affiliated company or agency. However, as described in greater detail below, we may share your information under 
certain circumstances with business partners that help this site function or assist us in fulfilling or servicing your 
order, as well otherwise detailed below. Personal information that we collect about you outside of the United States shall be governed by separate 
privacy policies.
		

This policy describes the personal information we collect about you, why we collect it, how we use it, and when we 
share it with third parties. Our policy also describes the choices you can make about how we collect and use certain 
information. If our information practices change, we will post an updated policy on our website. You can tell if the 
policy has changed by checking the revision date that appears on this policy.  We shall not apply changes in our 
policy retroactively to information collected from you under a prior policy if, in the reasonable exercise of our 
discretion, we determine that the changes substantively affect your rights, unless we have given you notice of the 
changes of the policy and an opportunity to opt out.  We will provide this notice to you by email if we have a current 
email address for you and otherwise by posting notice of the change prominently on the home page of our website.


Tory Burch complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by 
the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European 
Union member countries and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Tory Burch’s 
certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
		
Information We Collect & How We Use It

		We sometimes ask you for certain kinds of personal information to provide the services we offer. By 
providing your personal information as set forth herein, you are authorizing Tory Burch to store and use your 
information accordingly. This information includes:  
		


Shopping: We may ask for information such as your name, billing and shipping address, telephone number, email address and payment card information in order to process your purchase, confirm your order and ship the items to you. If you elect to be added to the Tory Burch marketing list, we may use your contact information to communicate with you about our products, services, surveys and promotions.
                        

My Account: You have the opportunity to create a personal shopping account with Tory Burch, 
which allows you to shop faster and easier. Using a user name and a password of your choice, you may access your 
account online at any time to add, delete, or change information. In creating this account, you authorize Tory Burch 
to store your name and email address. Should you elect to do so, you may also include in your “My Account” your 
telephone number, payment card information, and shipping and billing addresses. If you choose to include such 
additional information then you are also authorizing Tory Burch to store such information accordingly.   Each of these 
options is for your convenience only. If you ever use a public computer to visit the “My Account” section of our 
website we strongly encourage you to log out at the conclusion of your session. 
		
		
Through the “My Account” feature, you may create a Wish List of products you want and share the items on your list by 
copying and pasting the URL. You may elect to make this Wish List public, so that friends and family can search for 
you by either name or email address. 
		

When you create an account with Tory Burch, you will be given the option to be added to the Tory Burch marketing list. 
Whether or not you select this option, your personal information will never be sold to anyone and except as 
specifically provided herein, your personal information will not be shared.   
			

Email List: You may also sign up on the website to receive promotional emails from Tory 
Burch. To sign up we may ask for information such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, 
gender, age, birthday and preferences. Subscriptions to the email list can be cancelled at any time.
			

Removal from Lists: To be removed from our marketing list, please email us at 
inquiries@toryburch.com.  You may also click the unsubscribe button found at the bottom of the emails in order to be removed from emails that we send you. Please allow us at least ten (10) business days from when the request was 
received to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your 
request. 
			

Customer Care: If you call, email or chat with our Customer Care center, we may ask for 
information such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and if you choose to make a purchase, 
your credit card information. We use this information to assist you and to process or review your transaction.  When 
you place an order through Customer Care, you will be asked to provide your credit card information. Tory Burch 
does not store your credit card information unless you choose to include it in your “My Account” (see above). 
                        

Surveys, Sweepstakes & Promotions: On this website, you may be able to participate in 
surveys, sweepstakes and promotions. If you choose to participate in these promotions, we may request information such 
as your name, age, email address, mailing address, telephone number, and interests or product preferences. This 
information is used to enter you into our contests, sweepstakes and other promotions. We may use this information to 
communicate with you about our products, services and promotions, but only if you have given us your consent to do so.

friends. In order to do so, we may ask for information such as your name, email address, zip code and telephone

		Others with Whom We May Share Your Information 
		

Service Providers and the Tory Burch Foundation: We may disclose information to outside companies 
that help us bring you the products and services we offer. For example, we may work with an outside company to: (a) 
manage a database of customer information; (b) assist us in distributing emails; (c) assist us with direct marketing 
and data collection; (d) provide us data storage and analysis; (e) provide fraud prevention; (f) provide customer 
service by phone; and (g) provide other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential. We 
require that these outside companies agree to keep confidential all information we share with them and to use the 
information only to perform their obligations in the agreements and in a manner consistent with this Privacy and Usage 
Policy. We also may share your information with the Tory Burch Foundation so that you can receive information regarding this organization, which was founded in 2009 by Ms. Tory Burch. 
		

Compliance with Law: We may provide access to information when 
legally required to do so, to cooperate with legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our 
website, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors 
of this website or the public. 
		
Links to other sites

		While visiting our website, you may link to sites operated by our business partners or other third 
parties. This does not mean that we endorse these sites. We do not make any representations or warranties about any 
website you may access through the Tory Burch website. They are independent from us, and we have no control over, or 
responsibility for, their information or activities.
		

		In addition, our privacy practices may differ from those of these other sites. If you provide personal 
information at one of those sites, you are subject to the privacy policy of the operator of that site, not the Tory 
Burch Privacy and Usage Policy. Please make sure you understand the other site's privacy policy before providing 
personal information. 
		
Security

	Tory Burch uses commercially reasonable measures to keep your financial information private and safe. We take 
appropriate physical, electronic and administrative steps to maintain the security and accuracy of personally 
identifiable information we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database 
servers, as well as employing electronic security systems and password protections that guard against unauthorized 
access. In addition, it is our policy to never send your credit card number via email. Our customer service center 
and stores also operate over a private, secure network. Please note, however, that email is not encrypted and is not 
considered to be a secure means of transmitting credit card information.  
		

	We use what we consider to be industry standard security technology in transferring information to process 
your orders. All credit card transactions should take place in a protected area of our website, which is designed to 
reduce the risk of any loss, misuse or alteration of the information collected. When you have finished shopping and 
begin the checkout process, you should move into the protected area of our website. Once you've entered, the page address 
(URL) should change from http to https.  Also, a key or a closed lock should appear in the lower right hand corner of 
your screen to notify you of this change. You should remain in this secure zone for the entire checkout process. 
Please check that you are still in this protected area when you type in your credit card details.
		

	Unfortunately, despite our best efforts, the transmission of data over the Internet cannot be guaranteed to be 
100% secure. While we will use commercially reasonable means to ensure the security of information you transmit to us, 
we cannot guarantee that such information will not be intercepted by third parties. We may, however, prosecute any 
unauthorized or fraudulent transactions to the fullest extent permitted by law. 
		
“SPOOFING” AND “PHISHING”
“Spoofing” or “Phishing” are common Internet scams. These may occur when you receive an email from 
what appears to be a legitimate source requesting personal information from you. Please be aware that Tory Burch will 
NEVER send you an email requesting you to verify credit card or bank information. If you ever receive an email that 
appears to be from us requesting such information from you, DO NOT respond to it, and DO NOT click on any links 
appearing in the email. Instead, please forward the email to us at inquiries@toryburch.com, as we will endeavor to 
investigate all instances of possible Internet fraud.
Children's Privacy
 
		Our website is not meant for children.  We do not intentionally collect any personal information from 
children under the age of thirteen, and will dispose of any such information if we become aware that it has been 
provided to us. Our online contests or sweepstakes are restricted to entrants who are at least 18 years old or the age 
of majority in the jurisdiction where they are located, whichever is greater.
		
California Privacy Rights 

Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice 
describing what categories of personal information we share with third parties or corporate affiliates for those third 
parties’ or corporate affiliates' direct marketing purposes. That notice will identify the categories of information 
shared and will include a list of the third parties and affiliates with which it was shared, along with their names 
and addresses. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request 
to the following address: Tory Burch LLC, 11 West 19th Street, 7th Floor, New York, NY 10011, Attn: Customer Care 
or by email to inquiries@toryburch.com. Please allow 30 

days for a response.

what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. 
In the event of a corporate reorganization or asset transfer, your personal information may also be transferred.
