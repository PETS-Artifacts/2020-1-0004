Cookies
This website will set temporary session cookies whenever you visit the site. These cookies are needed to allow the session. They will be deleted when you close your browser session. The user’s IP address is not stored in any cookie. Cookies have a unique ID to identify the sessions which is completely anonymous for the purpose of enabling the session.
This website uses Matomo, a software to generate web statistics, that is entirely hosted in EU-OSHA’s servers, located in the European Union. Matomo will store cookies in your computer, but no personal data will be collected. An anonymous ID will enable Matomo to identify your session, but this ID is meaningless to anybody else, and it cannot be used to identify an individual user.
If you do not want EU-OSHA to track your activity through Matomo, you can opt-out from Matomo by clicking in the box below.
