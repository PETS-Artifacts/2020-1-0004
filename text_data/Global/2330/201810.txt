Privacy Commitment
We have a Global Privacy Policy that has been implemented across all Cengage Learning Companies, that protects all the Personal Information we receive from you as well as information we receive from schools and other third parties. It protects information collected online as well as offline.
This Program and Policy set the standards for Cengage both as a Controller (for its own data) and as a Processor (for its clients).  Additionally, we have updated our Privacy Program controls to address new requirements under GDPR. For more information, please read our complete Notice, linked to below or contact privacy@cengage.com.
If you are an educator, parent or student, Cengage Learning is a service provider to your school or organization; please reach out to the appropriate contact at your school or organization with questions or inquiries. This notice does not cover other organizations' sites that may be accessible via links on our sites. These sites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to read them.
We also want our privacy practices to be very clear, so you can interact with us in confidence. The statements and links below may answer your questions about how we handle your Personal Information. For a complete notice, view the Cengage Privacy Notice. If you have any other questions, please contact us.
