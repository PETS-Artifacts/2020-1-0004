Privacy Policy





The 
                    Immunization Action Coalition (IAC) treats the issue of privacy seriously. We do 
                    not sell, distribute, barter, or transfer email addresses or any other 
                    individually identifiable user information to third parties. Any information 
                    collected on this website is used only for the purposes stated. 





Only persons 
                    who ask to be added to email lists or request information receive email 
                    communications. You may request that your email address be removed from the IAC 
                    subscriber lists at any time and we will do so promptly.





Except for 
                    certain order pages that employ a third-party shopping cart, and certain survey pages, this site does not 
                    use "cookie" technology, including the  recording of visitor 
                      information on your computer system for automatic retrieval when you 
                      subsequently visit our website.





Our Web 
                    server routinely collects and stores information provided by your Web browser 
                    such as the pages visited on our site, the date and time of the visit, the 
                    Internet address (URL or IP address) of the referring site, the IP address or 
                    your connection to the Internet, the version of browser used, and the 
                    capabilities of the browser. IAC makes no attempt to identify individual 
                    visitors from this information.





IAC has taken 
                    steps to make information received from online visitors as secure as possible 
                    against unauthorized access and use. All information is protected by security 
                    measures that are periodically reviewed.





This site 
                    contains many links to other websites not under the control of IAC. IAC accepts 
                    no responsibility for the privacy practices or failures of those websites.





The 
                    Immunization Action Coalition may update this Privacy Policy at any time by 
                    posting revisions and you agree that it is your responsibility to review the 
                    Privacy Policy in effect at the time of your access to this website.

                    comments about this policy or our website, you may contact us  by email at admin@immunize.org or by writing to us at the address on the bottom of this page.
