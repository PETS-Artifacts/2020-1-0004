Geotargeting, sometimes referred to as location aware browsing or geotracking,        is the method of determining the geographic location of a website visitor        and delivering different content to that visitor based on their location.        GeoIP2 JavaScript API is the geotargeting tool we have chosen. You can        choose whether or not your browser will allow your geographic location        to be passed along to our website.
