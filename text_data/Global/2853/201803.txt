How do you contact us with questions?

1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU
We collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.
(a) We will collect and process your personal data when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
We also collect your Internet Protocol (‘IP’) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers and/or software, and/or to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.
(b) We may collect certain information that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use through the Services, such as your operating system and browser type. We use analytics and similar services, as explained in our Cookie Policy, to help us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.
(c) When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best version of the application to provide you. We do not ask you for, access, or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.
(d) When you contact us for customer support we may collect additional information to resolve your issue and may request you to bind your Lynda account with your LinkedIn account to improve your customer service experience. However, if you elect not to bind, you will still be able to receive customer service.
(e) We are not a site targeted at children or those under the age of 16. If you are a school and you use a Lynda service within the United States for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain limited activities (such as taking online educational and informational courses).
2. WHERE WE STORE DATA
By submitting your personal data, you agree to the transfer, storing and processing of your data in the United States. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION
We use information held about you in the following ways:

To present content from our Services in an effective manner for you and for your computer or mobile device
To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us or which we feel may interest you
To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection
If you pay for Services using a credit card, we will transmit your credit card data to the appropriate credit card company and/or credit card payment processing company
To allow you to participate in interactive features of our Services, when you choose to do so
To contact you about our Services
In any other way we may describe when you provide the information or when we prompt you regarding a new use of information about you.

4. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION
We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell, trade, rent or disclose your information to others, except as provided herein:
(a) We provide and support some of our Services through contractual arrangements with service providers and other third parties. We and our service partners use your Personal Data to operate our Websites and to deliver Services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on our Websites; and provide order information to third parties that help us deliver the Services.
(b) We will also disclose Personal Data in the following circumstances: (i) if it is required by law enforcement or judicial authorities, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation; (ii) if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process; (iii) to protect our rights, reputation, property or the safety of us or others; (iv) to defend or enforce our rights or your obligations; (v) if the disclosure is required by mandatory professional standards; (vi) to a third party with your prior consent to do so; or (vii) if we are under a duty to disclose or share your Personal Data in order to enforce or apply any contracts or agreement that may exist between you and us including this Privacy Policy, our Website Use Policy and our Terms of Service. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
(c) In the event that LinkedIn decides to sell all or part of its stock or assets or enter into a merger, we reserve the right to include your data, including Personal Data among the assets transferred to the acquiring or surviving company.

8. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE LYNDA SERVICE
For certain services, we collect information under the direction of our clients (e.g., an entity that subscribes to the Services for use by the entity’s personnel). In this respect, we act as a data processor under applicable laws. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and fulfill our obligations under those agreements with the data controllers.
9. DATA SECURITY
Access by you to your account is available through a password and/or unique user name selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, that you change your password often using a combination of letters and numbers, and that you ensure you use a secure web browser. We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and username. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of your account after you are finished, in order to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.
Please notify us as soon as possible if your username or password is compromised at support@lynda.com.
Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Data, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Data in our control may have been compromised, we will try to notify you. To the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail and you consent to our use of email as a means of such notification. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please email us at support@lynda.com with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.
10. COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
When you use our Websites we may use cookies and other technologies in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Services. Learn more in our Cookie Policy.

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the App, the events that occur within the App, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the App was downloaded from.
