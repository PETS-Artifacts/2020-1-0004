4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES
Headspace and our analytics partners, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and measuring how many people are using services.
We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences.  Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information.  Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
We partner with third parties, such as Facebook, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms.  Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads.  We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals.  For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices.  Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms.
We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms.
The Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information.
