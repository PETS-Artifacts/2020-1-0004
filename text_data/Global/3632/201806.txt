When you bank with Atlantic Bank, you can feel confident that your financial information is confidential and secure. \r\n\t\t\t\tOnly certain employees are authorized to access Customer Information and this is done for business purposes only. Our employees are bound by a code of conduct that requires confidential management of Customer Information and are subject to disciplinary action if they fail to follow this code.\r\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, we go to great lengths to secure your online banking transactions using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). This is a protocol used to encrypt all web traffic between the customer\x92s browser and our servers. Customers are also provided with tokens and account lockout feature to authenticate and protect from unauthorized users. Our site is also set to timeout and forces an online customer to login again after an extended period of inactivity. \r\n\t\t\t\tThe Personal login has also been changed to ensure the utmost safety for our users when signing in to Atlantic Online.\r\n\t\t\t\tSafety Tips \r\nWe are committed to ensuring that your accounts remain secure and private. Here are some tips that will help you feel comfortable as well as give you some peace of mind in all your online activities.\r\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Information Protection\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTry to reduce the amount of mails you receive that display personal information.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMake copies of all information i.e. license, credit card, etc. that you carry daily in your purse or wallet and keep it in a safe place. You will know what you had in your wallet and all of the account numbers and phone numbers to call and cancel. Keep the photocopy in a safe place. Also carry a photocopy of your passport when traveling abroad.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPersonal Computer Usage\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tBe very protective of your personal and account information. There are criminals who try to trick you by creating sites that look similar to real sites. The best way to know whom you are dealing with is to type the address in your browser address bar. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInstall all security updates offered by your software provider(s). \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tInstall a personal firewall on your computer. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tProtect your computer against viruses and spyware by using anti-spyware software, anti-virus software, and automatic upgrades. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tScan your computer regularly for both spyware and viruses\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAlways log off from your Online Banking session. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tEmail\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you receive a suspicious email using Atlantic Bank\x92s name and asking for personal or Atlantic Bank account information, immediately forward the email to [emailÂ protected] We will never send you an email asking for your online username or password.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you think you may have provided personal or account information in response to a fraudulent email or website, report the fraud immediately, change your password, and monitor your account activity frequently. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOpen email attachments only if you know the sender. It is best to scan attachments with your anti-virus software prior to opening.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tQuestion suspicious emails\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPasswords & PIN\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChoose passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs) that are difficult for others to guess. For example, do not use names (i.e., your mother\'s maiden name) familiar numbers (i.e., your birthday) or your Social Security number (SSN).\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tUse a different password for each of your online accounts. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo not share your username, passwords, or PINs with anyone. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChange your passwords often.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tIf using a public computer, i.e. at an Internet caf\xe9, be sure to look around before typing in your password. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tDo not write down your username, password, or PIN numbers. If you must, make sure it is stored in a safe place and not in your wallet or phone.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tCredit Cards\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChoose passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs) that are difficult for others to guess. \r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t
