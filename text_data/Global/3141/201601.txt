Privacy Statement
Auburn University respects both the privacy of individuals who use its websites and the privacy and security of the information they provide to the University. The University makes every reasonable effort to ensure the confidentiality and security of that information within its system. 
From its official web pages, Auburn University routinely collects information from Internet visitors. This data is used statistically and in aggregate to help manage the site and improve service. Some information is automatically logged, such as the pages visited and the IP address from which the access occurred. Some information is stored in cookies, which visitors can control by their browser settings. As a general rule, Auburn University does not track individual visitor profiles, but does reserve the right to use log data to investigate resource management or security concerns.
Web visitors using online forms or applications may choose to supply information voluntarily. However, it is Auburn University’s intention that such information be kept private and secure and be used only for the purposes for which it was supplied.
Auburn University policy does not allow the release of personally identifiable information to third parties (other than its agents when required for university business) except with permission of the person identified or as required by law.
