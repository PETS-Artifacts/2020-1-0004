Personal data privacy
By accessing the ECMWF web site, certain information about users, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, navigation through the site, software used and time spent, as well as other similar information, will be stored on ECMWF servers. We also use Google Analytics. The information will not specifically identify users and any information stored will be used internally for web site traffic analysis only. If users provide unique identifying information, such as name, address and other information on forms stored on this site, or use an ECMWF user-id, this information will be used for statistical purposes only and will not be published or made available to a third party.
ECMWF does not sell or rent its web site users' names, addresses, email addresses or other personal information.
If you are registered in an ECMWF database and would like your name to be removed, please contact our call-desk calldesk@ecmwf.int.
Use of IP address
The IP address is a number that is automatically given to your computer and is used when you are browsing web sites on the Internet. Web servers that host web pages automatically identify your computer through its IP number. It is possible to derive users' locations from their IP addresses. ECMWF uses IP addresses and the derived location of users, in order to carry out statistical analysis of the use of its web site.
Use of cookies
Cookies are the information that a web site transfers to usersâ€™ hard drives for record-keeping purposes; passwords are not saved in cookies. Cookies help ECMWF to ensure that its web site responds to users' needs, allowing us to provide easier access to protected pages, and personalisation and data persistence features.
