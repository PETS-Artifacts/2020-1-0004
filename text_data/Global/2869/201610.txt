Privacy Policy


Updated: June 17, 2016
At VocabularySpellingCity.com, we consider children's safety to be all-important. Our site is designed to comply with state and federal regulations enacted to protect the privacy of children and ensure the security and confidentiality of student data, including, but not limited to, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), the Federal Education Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”), and the California Education Code Section 49073.1. The following Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures relating to the use of our site, our commitment to privacy, and the access and use of data.
Introduction
VocabularySpellingCity.com exists to serve educational institutions, parents and students and strives to provide a safe, positive experience for children.  We do not collect information directly from children.  Any students under the age of 18 wishing to use the site, must be registered by a parent, legal guardian, or school official.  VocabularySpellingCity.com does not sell or market directly to minors and always seeks the appropriate authorization whenever we identify a minor attempting to purchase a service.  Whenever we collect Personally Identifiable Information, or “PII”, we do so with the sole purpose of supporting the educational purposes of which the site was designed.  We do not publish or distribute any PII of students to third parties, and we try to limit access to third party web sites that may request PII.  We also prohibit students from publicly posting or distributing PII without prior parental consent.  In addition, in an effort to further protect children who use the site, VocabularySpellingCity does not use the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to entice children to divulge more information than is needed to participate in an activity.
Identity of Registrants
VocabularySpelllingCity.com and the VocabularySpellingCity Apps on iOS and Android are designed to provide vocabulary and spelling practice for students. Parents or educational institutions may register with the site by providing their name, email address, affiliation with a school or district (if applicable), phone number and billing information.  A user’s contact information may be used to send users service-related announcements when it is necessary or advisable to do so. However, a user’s personal information will never be shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.  User information may be shared with partners, business affiliates or third party service providers who work for VocabularySpellingCity.com and operate some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and credit card processing. However, these third parties are established service providers, who are bound to practice adequate security measures and only use user information for the sole purpose of providing the services. A user’s information may also be shared with law enforcement or other third parties as required by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or other legal process.
VocabularySpellingCity.com has appropriate security measures in place to safeguard against unauthorized access to the personal information collected at our site, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections. We only store passwords in an encrypted format and we do not store any credit card information.>
Parents and educational institutions registering with the site are asked to create a username and password during the registration process, or, if they prefer, one may be assigned to them. We use usernames and passwords of subscribers’ accounts to authenticate logins, allow access to the paid content and monitor subscription compliance. The username is also used to authenticate users when requesting technical support. The passwords are all encrypted when stored.  Parents or educational institutions are required to create a user name for each student during the registration process.   Parents or educational institutions may create a password for the student account during registration, or one will be assigned to the student account by VocabularySpellingCity.  We do not require any PII of the students who will be using our services during the registration process or at any other time.  Parents or educational institutions may choose to provide a student’s name or class when setting up a student’s account, in order to monitor the student’s activities and progress more easily. However, this is optional.
Display of Registrant Information
VocabularySpellingCity.com is a web 2.0 social media-type service that includes user-generated content in terms of posted word lists and discussions on the forum. Parents and educational institutions wishing to participate in social media-type services are required to set up accounts in order to maximize privacy and security.  The name and username of the account holders will be displayed on the VocabularySpellingCity website associated with their selected school and will be viewable by people and by automated systems, such as the automated indexing software utilized by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.  While the forum is moderated, the problems of misinformation, false identities and other risks typical of the internet in its current state exist on VocabularySpellingCity.com. There is no way to verify whether someone who registers as a parent or educator at a particular school is truly that parent or educator at that school.  Therefore, it is possible for a person to register and post while posing as an educator or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. All VocabularySpellingCity.com users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions.  If VocabularySpellingCity.com suspects a fraudulent account has been set up, we will investigate and take measures to ban that account user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.
Collection, Use, Storage and Disclosure of Student Information
Parents or educational institutions control what student information is provided to VocabularySpellingCity.com.  Information that parents and educational institutions choose to enter regarding students should always be limited to information that is relevant to a legitimate educational purpose.  The only information that is required to set up a student account is a user name and password.   Parents or educational institutions may choose to provide additional information about the student, such as the student’s name or class, when setting up a student’s account in order to monitor the student’s activities and progress more easily.  However, this is optional.  VocabularySpellingCity agrees that any information (1) directly related to a student enrolled by an educational institution and provided and maintained by that educational institution or (2) acquired directly from the student enrolled by an educational institution through activities and coursework on VocabularySpellingCity.com assigned to that student by the educational institution, continues to be the property of and under the control of the educational institution, and will not be retained or available to VocabularySpellingCity, if required by the contract between VocabularySpellingCity and the educational institution.
VocabularySpellingCity.com stores the data created by students so that the students, the students’ parents, or the students’ educational institutions can access it and use it for educational purposes. Parents and educational institutions are able to review, manage, or edit student information at any time by logging into their accounts.  At this time, VocabularySpellingCity.com does not automatically delete materials created by the student (e.g. quizzes and activities completed) when a student’s account is closed, unless required by contract or other agreement.  However, VocabularySpellingCity reserves the right to delete student information or materials at any time after a student account has been closed.  Therefore, parents or educational institutions are encouraged to print out any student data or materials they want prior to closing a student account.
Student data collected on this site will not be used for any unauthorized purpose or disclosed to any unauthorized person or third party without express written permission from the student’s parents or the educational institutions, other than as provided in this Privacy Policy or by written contract between the educational institution and VocabularySpellingCity.com.   However, VocabularySpellingCity reserves the right to use anonymous cookies for tracking website statistics, such as visitors, length of time on the site, and conversion rates.
VocabularySpellingCity.com also reserves the right to use aggregated, deidentified data to improve our educational products, demonstrate the effectiveness of our educational products in marketing, and develop and improve our site, services or applications.  That aggregated, deidentified data may be shared with third parties.
VocabularySpellingCity.com does not use PII to market any products or services directly to students or their parents.  In the event that we wish to release aggregated data that identifies a particular school by name, VocabularySpellingCity will enter into a separate agreement with the school or obtain written authorization from the school to authorize release and publication.
VocabularySpellingCity is committed to protecting student data against unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure.  To this end, we have implemented reasonable and appropriate safeguards when collecting and storing student data in our database.  Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment designed to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall.  The servers are also backed up to a secure offsite data center. We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser remains encrypted. Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the student information linked to each parents or educator (depending on the type of account) is separated and parents and/or educational institutions only have access to their own student data.  Only limited VocabularySpellingCity.com personnel have access to the database, and they only access the database when necessary to provide services. We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation and change management for all applicable servers and we audit our practices at least once a year. While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we will notify the affected user(s), and as appropriate, coordinate with the user(s) to support its notification of affected individuals, students and parents when there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.
