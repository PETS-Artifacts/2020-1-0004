These are described immediately below.A. Consent to Share and Disclose Personal Information, Including Data Transfers Internationally. We may share information within the ANI organization, including our subsidiaries and affiliates. We may also share information with companies that provide support services to us (such as credit card processors, mailing houses, web hosts, technical support providers, fulfillment centers, or other services or for enforcing or investigating transactions or business operations). These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorized to use the information we share with them for any other purpose, but we do not control these companies. You agree that ANI and those with whom we share personal information ("Recipients") may disclose and transfer your personal information worldwide (including in and outside the U.S, Canada, the European Union, and other jurisdictions) for any purpose relating to our operations, programs, or otherwise that is not allowed or prohibited by this Privacy Statement. ANI may transfer information that you send to us, including without limitation, personally identifiable information, to countries that do not provide the same level of legal data protection as the country from which you access this Site.

SECURITYANI employs what we believe are commercially reasonable efforts to provide reasonable procedural and technical safeguards for your personally identifiable information and payment information against loss, theft, alteration, and unauthorized access, use and disclosure where we are legally required to protect it, but this is not a promise that your information will never be disclosed except as provided herein. However, the nature of the Internet is such that information may be transmitted over networks without appropriate security measures and may be accessed, deleted, altered, used or disclosed by unauthorized persons. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION IN ANY FORM. Information can sometimes be intercepted or accessed in violation of law, contract, or policy, and technologies do not always work as anticipated.Because of the international nature of the services and products provided by this Site and the nature of ANI's business, your personally identifiable information may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout ANI worldwide for the purposes described above. This may mean that personally identifiable information is transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations which protect personally identifiable information, such as the United States, where the server for this Site is located.7.

SUPPLEMENTAL PRIVACY STATEMENT-MOBILE APPSThis Supplemental Privacy Statement â€” Mobile Apps ("App Statement") supplements the Augusta National, Inc. Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement"). This App Statement (as well as the main Privacy Statement) applies if you download or use The Official Masters Tournament App or any mobile application that we offer (alone or with others) (each, an "App") from time to time for download, such as on the Site, or through a third party platform (such as the Apple iTunes store or Google Play, etc.). Additionally, wherever the Privacy Statement uses the term "Site," that term is defined in the Privacy Statement to include all Apps.This App Statement is part of our Privacy Statement, which is part of our Terms of Use. Terms used but not defined in this App Statement are defined in those documents. DOWNLOADING OR USING AN APP, CREATING AN ACCOUNT PROFILE, OR AFFIRMATIVELY SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH AN APP WILL BE YOUR CONSENT TO OUR TERMS OF USE, INCLUDING OUR PRIVACY STATEMENT (WHICH INCLUDES THIS APP STATEMENT), ALL AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME.A. Information Automatically Collected by Apps. When you download or use an App, personal information about you or the device that you use in connection with the App may automatically be collected by us or by third parties. This may include, for example, information about your download or use of the App, unique device identifiers associated with the device(s) you use to download or use the App, or information associated with equipment or systems used in connection with your device (e.g., an identifier of a Wi-Fi router or Internet access point). Third parties may also obtain information, such as your mobile device manufacturer or carrier, mobile or data network systems or operators, other providers of other apps or code on your device, and anyone who has administrative privileges to devices you use. In general, we do not control what information those kinds of third parties may receive and do not take any steps affirmatively to provide them with more information than they would obtain from other apps you might choose to download.You may also be reminded by the app "store" (e.g., a third party platform you might use to obtain the App, such as Apple iTunes store or Google Play, etc.) that certain information might be sought by us or others, or that certain privacy policies will apply to an App. You agree that we may rely upon any consents or agreements you provide to such stores or device manufacturers (e.g., if you tell them that itâ€™s okay that an App collect "location" or other personal information, we may rely on your consent as if you had given it directly to us).B. Additional Information Collected in Apps. In addition to the types of personal information that we collect on the Site generally, additional information may be collected in an App. For example, App features may allow you to provide additional information such as location preferences. The information you decide to include may be synchronized between the Site and the App so that you may have access to it from several devices.C. Updates to, and Deletion of, Information. You may update some information (not all of which will necessarily be personal information) provided to an App by using any functionality in the App for that. You can remove Apps by deleting or uninstalling them from all of devices they are on. Properly removing the App will stop your device from providing further information to us or others, but will not affect information already collected or Disclosed, including information that resides somewhere else. For example, our App may synchronize with your account profile on the Site (and vice versa) and the Site information for such account profiles is held by us. To eliminate that information, you will need to edit your account profile information on the Site as described in Section 7 (Questions, Access, Contact Information, Choice, and Correction). Additionally, because of the way we maintain account profiles, residual copies of account profile, App, and other associated information may remain on our backup systems. Also, App or information removal (full or partial) will not have any effect on information already disclosed or relied upon by us or others.D. How We Use Information Collected in Apps. In addition to the uses of personal information allowed in the Privacy Statement, we make these kinds of uses of personal information collected in an App. We disclose it:to the rest of our Site and as provided with respect to the rest of the Site, and we combine it with information that we collect on, through or in connection with the Site;for marketing purposes and to help us improve products and services, including to send you emails and other communications if youâ€™ve created an account profile on the Site; andto our affiliates and other third parties or persons who assist with the operation of an App, the rest of the Site, or app stores.E. Consent to Share and Disclose Personal Information. In addition to consenting to the Terms of Use and Privacy Statement, you agree that by using an App or providing personal information in the App, you are consenting to the collection, retention, use, and disclosure of your information in accordance with the terms of this App Statement and the Privacy Statement. You also agree that you are consenting to disclosure of your information to third parties as stated in this App Statement (e.g., see the How We Use Information Collected in Apps section above).F. Security. The "Security" section of our Privacy Statement and the "Registration Information and Security" section of our Terms of Use provides information about our general security. Apps use mobile phones and other devices, and any security of data that resides on the device will only be as secure as the device itself. Please be advised, however, that the transmission of information over wireless and wired networks is not inherently secure and, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security measures, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, your information may be subject to interception or loss which is beyond our control.
