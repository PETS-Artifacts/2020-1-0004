    Each time a user visits our website, certain use and navigation information is collected by our servers. This information is aggregate and anonymous. It gives us information such as the number, frequency and duration of visits to each web page which we use to improve the content and navigation features of our website. A third-party cookie may also be placed on your computer which will collect information about your visit to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

Voluntary Surveys 
    We periodically survey our guests and catalog requesters for their vacation interests and related travel patterns. We encourage you to complete these surveys because: a) they provide us with information that helps us improve the types of trips we offer; and b) they help us direct specific Backroads messages to you that you may find most interesting. Your participation in these surveys is always voluntary.

Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member information at any time. 
Sharing and Disclosure of Information Backroads Collects 
    Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Backroads will not disclose personal information to any third party unless we believe that disclosure is necessary: (1) to conform to legal requirements or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by Backroads, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (2) to enforce the Backroads Terms of Service Agreement or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service. Backroads reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Backroads or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest.
