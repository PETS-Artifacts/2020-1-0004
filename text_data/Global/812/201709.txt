ASPS does not collect personally identifiable information from you, including e-mail addresses, without asking you. In some instances, ASPS may request that you voluntarily supply information, including e-mail address, street address, telephone number or other information, to allow the society to personalize and enhance your site visit or to provide the opportunity for follow up after your site visit. Whether you provide information is entirely voluntary. When you voluntarily supply personally identifiable information, we assume that you have consented to our use of the personally identifiable information subject to this privacy policy.

Use of Information Provided
If you voluntarily provide information, you consent to the collection and use of your personally identifiable information by the society. However, ASPS does not sell or rent personal information collected through this site to anyone.
The ASPS websites may include the option to make purchases or register for events. To process these transactions, we may collect personal information or direct to you to third-party providers of the services. If we collect personal information, we may share your personal information with our agents, representatives, contractors, service providers or other third parties so that they can provide use with support services such as authorization of credit card transactions and order fulfillment as well as your credit card issuer. By voluntarily providing your personal information, you consent to ASPS providing your personal information to third parties that may provide these services. You agree that we are not responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions.
ASPS may collect certain standard, non-personally identifiable information that your browser normally provides when you request to view a page from a web server, such as your IP address, browser type, access times. ASPS uses this information to support the operation of its website and to analyze the traffic patterns on our site.
ASPS may use aggregate statistics about website visitors, such as volume, traffic patterns, login activity, referral sources and related site information to support the operation of its websites. It may also provide this aggregate information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifiable information about the users. ASPS may also disclose information in special cases when it has a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; (c) enforce the Website Terms and Conditions of Use; or (d) act to protect the interests of our users or others. Occasionally ASPS may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. ASPS reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
If you have voluntarily provided personally identifiable information, ASPS may, from time to time, send mail or e-mail to you regarding products and services. If you do not want to receive such offers and mailings, you can easily indicate that by following the instructions on the correspondence.
