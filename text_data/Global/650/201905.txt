Privacy Statement
EU GDPR compliant, WhyQuit.com sells nothing, refuses donations and no WhyQuit webpage allows visitor comments or input other than sending us an email. More than 2 million annual visitors and we do not request or collect any personal identifying information such as names, addesses, telephone numbers or email addresses.
While WhyQuit itself does not use cookies (see CookieChecker.com), we use Google Analytics which does in fact use them.
We rely upon Google Analytics to analyze user activity in order to improve WhyQuit. For example, Google Analytics provides understanding into such things as the search terms used to locate our pages, the number of visitors viewing each page, and the percentage using desktop, tablet or mobile devices.
Most sites use Google Analytics.  Use the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on if desiring to prevent your data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.
WhyQuit is hosted by GoDaddy which is certified in compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.
WhyQuit's GoDaddy server site logs currently record and contain visitor IP addresses.  While important to website security in protecting against hacking, without law enforcement's assistance, WhyQuit has no way of connecting any IP address to any natural person.
We are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of all visitors to our sites, including members of Turkeyville, our Facebook support group, readers of archived posts at Freedom (our first support site which no longer accepts members), and at YouTube, where Joel Spitzer's more than 400 videos are hosted.
Visitor and Member Communications
Turkeyville members and YouTube visitors are able to delete their posts, and at Facebook update their privacy settings.  Unless intended for sharing on WhyQuit's Turkey's Triumphs or other similar page, all member email communications are treated as confidential, including email addresses.   Please be advised that our staff has a long standing policy of not sharing any member personal information with any other member, including not disclosing member e-mail addresses.  Contact us at managers@whyquit.com should you desire assistance in deleting any message or comment.
A read-only fourm, in order to help protect the privacy of former Freedom members, all Freedom memberships (except for those of our 3 volunteer administrators) have been deleted. Additonally, all Freedom membership qualification records which included screen names and prospective member email addresses have been deleted.  Hosted by Tapatalk, if visiting and reading at Freedom please read Tapatalk's Privacy Policy.
 Facebook Privacy Alert: Turkeyville is a public Facebook group. As such, messages you post at Turkeyville can be read by all Facebook members and may also appear on your Facebook social network.

    
Turkeyville Messages & YouTube Comments
When posting messages or comments, remain mindful that they are visible to all visitors.  When posting messages take care and exercise sound judgment when disclosing any personal identifying information, as doing so immediately makes it public information.
Also remain mindful that, as at Freedom, which was founded in 1999, message board posts may be permanently archived and become a lasting treasure chest that aids future generations in breaking nicotine's grip upon their life.  Still, simply contact us should you desire assistance in deleting any old message or comment.
Be advised that our information management policy encourages public use of all WhyQuit resources for worldwide smoking cessation and prevention purposes, so long as there are no costs or charges associated with their use.
In theory, this means that  one or more of your thought provoking threads, posts or comments could be used as a youth nicotine dependency prevention teaching tool in a Philippine classroom, as part of a handout at an Africian smoking cessation seminar, or simply e-mailed and shared between Australian smoking friends. 

Survey Information
WhyQuit may from time to time provide visitors with links or pages that allow or invite participation in surveys, polls or other informal or formal research.  If a link is provided to a page on any site other than WhyQuit please read that site's privacy policy before participating.
Links
WhyQuit, Freedom, Turkeyville and YouTube contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we cannot be responsible for the privacy practices of any linked sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

Facebook and YouTube's Privacy Statement
Facebook and YouTube have their own Privacy Policies which should be read if spending time at either site:

Protection and Use of Information
