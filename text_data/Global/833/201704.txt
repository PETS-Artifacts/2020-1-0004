Protection of your privacy
This privacy policy applies to all of the activities of the EnergyAustralia group of companies operating in Australia, including the handling of credit-related personal information.
 
We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

What kinds of personal information do we collect?
‘Personal information’ is information or an opinion, in any form (whether true or not), about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
 
The kinds of personal information we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, supplier, stakeholder, job applicant or in some other capacity.
 
For example, if you are a customer or a potential customer, we may collect your name, address, telephone number, date of birth, other forms of identification and information about your financial circumstances, credit worthiness, credit history and the conduct of your account (including metering data). We may also collect sensitive information about you (see Do we hold sensitive information about you?). If you deal with us in some other capacity (for example, as a community representative or other stakeholder), we may collect your name, contact details and any other information
you choose to provide to us.
If we’re unable to collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.

At all times the collection of this information is obtained by lawful means in a manner that respects your privacy.

We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information). Sensitive information includes information about your health, your race or ethnic origin and religious beliefs.

You may wish to provide to us with sensitive information about you from time to time, for example where you have particular energy requirements due to special medical needs or where you wish to apply for a government concession available in relation to special medical needs. If you or someone living at your premises requires life support equipment, you should tell us (and provide confirmation from a medical practitioner) so that we may register your premises as having life support equipment, in which case certain restrictions on disconnecting your premises will apply. We may be required by law to disclose this information to certain entities, for example to your distributor.  
Do we record your phone calls to us?
Yes, there are two instances where your phone calls may be monitored. The first is for training, service quality control and compliance purposes, where we may record and monitor telephone calls between you and us.
The second concerns calls to traders in our energy trading business. These calls may be recorded and archived.  
How can you correct your information?
Please let us know if the personal information we have about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out of date and we will take reasonable steps to correct it, including any information relating to credit.  
How can you get access to your information?
You may request details of the personal information, including information related to credit, we hold about you and we will generally provide you with access subject to some exceptions permitted by law. For example, if providing this access may disclose information about another person, or may disclose commercially sensitive information, we may need to refuse to grant you access.
 
Charges may apply to cover the cost of us accessing and providing you with this information. If we cannot provide you access, we will provide a statement of our reasons.  
How do we manage privacy issues about credit?
This section of the privacy policy is issued by EnergyAustralia Pty Ltd ABN 99 086 014 968 (EA) and EnergyAustralia Services Pty Ltd ABN 73 081 074 160 (EA Services).  EA Services is a related body corporate of EA.  EA Services provides services to EA, including performing, on behalf of EA, tasks that are reasonably necessary in processing an application for credit made to EA or in managing credit provided by EA.  Both EA and EA Services are referred to collectively and individually as "we" and "our" and "us" in this section of the privacy policy.
When you enter into a contract with EA, EA Services will collect and hold your name, address, date of birth and drivers' licence number. EA Services may disclose this information to Equifax Australia and/or Dun & Bradstreet which are Credit Reporting Bureaus (CRBs) if EA Services decides to do a credit check or credit assessment on you from time to time. You may contact the relevant CRB to obtain its policy on how it manages your credit-related personal information using the contact details below:
Equifax Australia Information Services and Solutions Pty Limited (formerly known as Veda)
Mail: Attention: Public Access Division
Equifax Australia
PO Box 964
North Sydney NSW 2059
 
Dun and Bradstreet (Australia) Pty Ltd
Phone: 1300 734 806
Mail: Attention: Public Access Centre
Dun & Bradstreet Australia
PO Box 7405
St Kilda Rd VIC 3004
 
The detailed credit reporting information received back from a CRB (including credit scores) and any information derived from the credit check (collectively, "credit eligibility information") will be accessible only by a dedicated "credit team" employed by EA Services, and may be used by that team to manage your credit.
If you believe on reasonable grounds that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, you can request CRB not to use or disclose credit reporting information about you. In addition, you can request the CRB not to use your credit reporting information for the purposes of pre-screening of direct marketing by a credit provider.
The CRB may include information that EA Services provides to the CRB in reports that the CRB provides to other credit providers to assist them to assess your credit worthiness.
If EA Services does a credit check on you from time to time with a CRB, the CRB will generate a credit score for you and make this available to EA Services. EA Services will use this information from time to time to help us assess your credit worthiness, including by updating our own credit score for you.
If you become our customer, your "credit eligibility information" as described above will be stored in the secure location that is only accessible by the dedicated "credit team" employed by EA Services. However, the identification information we collected from you (that is, your name, address, date of birth and drivers' licence number) will be held in our customer database.
Some of our contractors to whom the credit information in our customer database may be disclosed are located overseas, including in India, New Zealand, The Philippines, Fiji and the US.
If you don't become our customer, your identification information will be held in our quotes database until such time as it is destroyed.
If, after reasonable follow up, you do not pay any outstanding amounts owed by you to us EA Services may supply to the CRB with this information along with relevant personal information. This may include:
identification information about you
the fact that you have applied for credit and we are a credit provider to you
advice about payments more than 60 days overdue which are ‘in collection’ that we are permitted to report to the CRB
that, in our opinion, you have committed a serious credit infringement
that credit provided to you has been paid or otherwise discharged
Notification to the CRB that any of your outstanding payments are no longer overdue will only be made following payment of the outstanding amount including any accrued interest.
You’re entitled to access and seek the correction of the credit-related personal information that we hold. If you have a complaint about the handling of your credit-related personal information you can contact our Privacy Officer.  
What if you disagree with our decision?
Where we make a decision about you or affecting you, you may ask us to explain the basis on which that decision was made, and you may ask to see the personal information (if any) on which our decision is based (see How can you get access to your information?).
