Protection of your information
Our security

The internet is not a secure medium. We have, however, put in place various security procedures to help to protect your personal information. Protection technologies we use include industry recognised firewalls, browser certification, password protection and limited access to personal information.

Confidentiality

We keep your personal information confidential. Our internal procedures cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.

Imperfect security

We do not represent, warrant or guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us, and any transmission is carried out at your sole risk. Once we receive information we have our own security systems in place, but we do not represent or warrant or guarantee that such systems cannot be breached. Although we will take steps to protect your personal details and you have some options to limit these no security measures are perfect and we cannot promise that only authorised people will access your personal information

Breach of security

If our security systems have been breached, then we will take appropriate steps to remedy this and to notify you of any breach.



Updating your details
If any of the details you have provided to us change, then it is your responsibility to inform us of any such changes.


Disclosure of information
Sharing of your personal information

We may provide personally identifiable information and non-personally-identifiable information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies, or other businesses or persons for the purpose of processing such information on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information in compliance with our Policy, and we use reasonable efforts to limit their use of such information and to use other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

Anonymous elements of your personal information

We may share information that is not personally identifiable (such as anonymous User usage data) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on our Website.

When we must disclose your personal information

We will disclose your personal data, personally identifiable information and your User activity and any other details if we are requested to do so by law or by any regulatory or governmental authority or by any law enforcement agency, or upon receipt of a court order or summons or a legitimate request by a third party (for example, the police) in investigating illegal activities to provide information concerning your activities on our Website.

Other disclosure of your personal information

We reserve the right to disclose information that we believe is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to protect the security or integrity of our Website, and to protect our Users and our Users’ rights, property, or personal safety.

No disclosure of personal information to advertisers

We do not provide any personally identifiable information to any advertisers, merchants or other Users. If you engaged with any advertisers, merchants or other Users on the Website, for example, in the Marketplace, then the terms in this Policy are not applicable to such arrangements and you should find out what privacy policies such third parties have in place.


The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who works for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, amongst other things, the provision of support services.  By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy.

Please do not share your password with anyone.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.

Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features with a view to preventing unauthorised access.

In the event of a sale, transfer, reorganisation or other disposal, in whole or in part, your details may form part of the transferred business assets and as such may be shared with our advisors and any prospective purchasers and their advisors.
