What is privacy? According to the Information and Privacy Commission, Privacy can mean the right to a sense of personal freedom, the right to be left alone and most importantly, the right to have information about oneself handled in a fair and proper manner. Privacy legislation UOW must handle your personal and health information in accordance with NSW's Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 and Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002.  These Acts set out the privacy principles that UOW must abide by when it collects, stores, uses and discloses personal and health information.
