At Oxfam, we rely on the generosity and support of private individuals like you to carry out our vital work to tackle poverty. That is why we want to be completely transparent about why we need the personal details we request when you support us and how we will use them.

When we will get in touch
The first time you give us personal details - for example, when you sign up to receive email updates, support our "Tag Your Bag" scheme, sign a petition, register for an event or make a donation - you may receive follow up information from us directly relevant to this activity, including how your support is helping.
If you have provided us with consent to use your details for marketing purposes, then we may also contact you about our projects and fundraising activities and other ways to support us.
You, our supporters, really are the life-blood of Oxfam. Our aim is to communicate with you in a way that makes you want to stay involved with us for as long as possible, as you see the value and impact of your support.
We will not share your data
Please be assured that we will not, under any circumstances, share your data with anyone for marketing purposes and you will not receive offers from other companies or organisations as a result of giving your details to us.
We may need to share limited information with our service providers who help us to prepare and send you our communications or process your donations and other responses. However, we will not allow these organisations to use your data for their own purposes and will take care to ensure that they keep your data secure.

If at any time you wish to change how we communicate with you, or update the information we hold, please do get in touch.

What details we ask for and why
There are minimum levels of information we need to obtain for different purposes - such as donating money or signing up to Gift Aid. We always ask for your name and title so we know how to talk to you. We need to be able to confirm any transactions you make on the Oxfam GB website by sending you an email, which is why this field is mandatory on all our web forms. We will separately seek your permission to use this for our wider marketing communications.
We ask for your house number and postcode so that we hold a valid postal address for you. We need this information for the following reasons:

To set up Direct Debits and one-off card payments
To claim Gift Aid
To deliver items to you (items you have purchased or event materials for example)
If you have agreed to receive post from us, we will use your postcode and address to send you relevant information.

In order to ensure that the data we hold about you is accurate and up to date, we may occasionally use information sources that are in the public domain to verify your details, such as address and telephone number. Sometimes we may use third parties to supplement the information that we hold as we only want to send you information which we believe you will be interested in.
We may also use your email address and phone number to match to your account on Facebook or other social media sites in order to show you Oxfam content while you are using these services. We will only do this where you have opted in to marketing emails or phone calls/SMS and using a secure technique known as 'hashing' The matching only works where you have previously disclosed your email address and phone/SMS to the social media site. No data is retained by the third party. We may also use your email address and phone/SMS to link to Facebook or other social media sites in order
    to identify other users of these sites whom we believe would be interested in Oxfam, and we may then show them Oxfam content.
There are two ways to stop this use of your data, you can either update your preferences at Oxfam by opting out of the relevant channel of communication, or you can do this via the social media site:
Updating your preferences with Oxfam will not guarantee that you never see Oxfam content, since the social media site may also select you based on other criteria and without your data having been shared by Oxfam.
