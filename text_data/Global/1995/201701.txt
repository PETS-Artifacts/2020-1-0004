Cookies may be set by a website or originate with third parties, such as advertisers.  A cookie itself is not designed or intended to read any information from a user's computer (other than the contents of the cookie). A cookie is simply an identifier used by the website that originally placed it on your hard drive. The actual contents of the cookie information can be retrieved by the same server to identify the computer and subsequently to customize, track, or regulate the use of a site based on information stored on the host server.

11. LINKS
We may offer links from our website to other websites (which may be hosted by third parties that we choose to offer co-branded products with or by unrelated companies) which we think may be of interest to you. Third party websites are not governed by this privacy policy and WinZip makes no representation as to their practices for dealing with your personal information. We recommend that you check the privacy policy of any website at the beginning of your visit to determine its practices.
12. CHAT ROOMS, NEWSGROUPS, BLOGS AND OTHER INTERACTIVE LOCATIONS
WinZip's website may have chat rooms, newsgroups, blogs, or other forums that permit individuals to interact online.  Some of these forums may allow you to post a profile picture, share your gender and age and display your user name or real name (if you choose to display it). Any information you post in online forums will be made public and WinZip cannot control nor is it responsible for the use any third parties may make of this information.
13. CHILDREN
WinZip's website is a general audience site that is neither designed nor intended to collect personal information from children who are under the age of 13. WinZip does not sell products for purchase by children. We sell children's products for purchase by adults.  We do not knowingly request personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. To ensure compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, children under the age of 13 should not access this site or provide any personal information to this site.  We encourage parents and guardians to supervise and join their children in exploring the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them not to provide personal information over the Internet without parental permission. Parents should additionally be aware of a growing variety of software capable of filtering online information to reflect their own choices and guidelines. If we become aware that a user is under the age of 13 and has provided personal information to us without prior verifiable parental consent, we will remove such personal information from our records.
14. ACCESS, MODIFICATION AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATION
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the information that we receive from you is accurate and kept up to date. You have the right to access your personal information, to verify its accuracy, and to correct inaccurate information.
If you do not want to be contacted for product, service or marketing initiatives, or if you would like to be removed from any direct marketing initiatives, corporate surveys, telemarketing or direct mail or e-mail lists, or if you would otherwise like to limit our use or disclosure of your personal information, please contact us at help@winzip.com or click here.
Some of our products display dynamic on-line communications (for example, through a message center), and you may elect not to receive these communications (e.g. such as product updates) by altering your message preferences in the specific product.  However, any alterations you make to these product-specific message preferences will not change your general user preferences with regard to the collection and use of your personal information by WinZip.   Alternatively, altering your general user preferences with regard to the collection and use of your personal information by WinZip will not change your product-specific message preferences.
15. RETENTION AND STORAGE OF INFORMATION
We will not retain your information for longer than is necessary for us to use it for the purposes for which it has been collected, unless otherwise required by law or because of pending litigation. When information is no longer required, we will ensure that all such data is removed from our database. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
As noted above in Section 6, we may use the services of third party companies to physically collect, store or remove your information on our behalf. Any such companies will have to comply with the terms of this policy.
16. BUSINESS TRANSFERS
The information that is collected by WinZip is considered to be an asset. In the event that WinZip, any affiliated company, division or portions of its assets are acquired by another company, such information may be one of the transferred assets. If so, the acquiring company may only use your information in ways consistent with this privacy policy (or any subsequent policy in effect at the time information is collected from you).   We note that information submitted or collected after a transfer may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor company.
17.  YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
If you are a resident of the State of California, under the California Civil Code, you have the right to request from companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to which the company has disclosed personal information during the preceding year for direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that if a company has a privacy policy that gives either an opt-out or opt-in choice for use of your personal information by third parties (such as advertisers) for marketing purposes, the company may instead provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options.
WinZip qualifies for the alternative option; it provides you with details on how you may either opt-out or opt-in to the use of your personal information by third parties for direct marketing purposes. Therefore, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your personal information for marketing purposes during the preceding year.
18.  INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER
Your information may be transferred to and stored on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside of Canada and choose to provide information to us, you should be aware that WinZip may transfer your personal information to Canada and process it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to such transfer.
19. CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY
We are always looking for ways to improve our business and our practices. Consequently, our policies will continue to evolve. As such, WinZip reserves the right to alter this privacy policy from time to time. Changes to this policy will be posted to our WinZip.com website. We encourage you to visit our privacy page from time to time to view our most current privacy policy.  If we make material changes to this privacy policy that expand our rights to use your personal information, we will notify you and seek your consent through email or a prominent posting on our website.
