The Interactive Mathematics Miscellany site works with reputed third parties that serve ads to this site: ValueClick.com, sovrn.com, Ezoic, and amazon.com. These companies do attempt to track your page selections via cookies with the purpose of determining your interests and browsing habits. The idea is that this information may help them serve you better, for example, by displaying ads that, in their view, may be of greater interest to you than the alternatives. While this information may be deemed personal, there is no way that those companies identify you as an individual. The practice is known as the behavioral ad serving. In any case, your browser has a facility to block the ads once and for all.
All major ad serving networks participate in the Network Advertising Initiative. The NAI allows web users to opt-out from behavioral advertising and provide a https://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.aspspecial tool that individuals may use to opt-out from behavioral campaigns of specific companies or all together. You are welcome to apply that tool to the adds that appear at this site.
