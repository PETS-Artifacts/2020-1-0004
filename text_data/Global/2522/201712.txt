MVS respects your concerns about privacy and values its relationship with you.
This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect via MVS’s web sites, how we may use that information and with whom we may share it. Our Privacy Policy also describes the measures we take to protect the security of your information. It will tell you how you can contact us to update your information, remove your name from our mailing lists or get answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices


			Personal Information We Collect
We may request that you provide certain personal information if you contact us, purchase an item from our website, request technical support, subscribe to a newsletter, provide feedback on a particular offer or product, participate in a promotion, or seek business development/career opportunities. The information we collect is generally limited to your full name and e-mail address, although we may request other information such as your billing address and credit card information in the event that you decide to complete a transaction. In general, we limit the amount of personal information we require to just that needed to complete a specific transaction. For example, we will not ask for billing information unless in connection with a billing transaction.
If you submit an order at our online store, you will be asked for information necessary to complete the transaction — such as your name, address, and credit card number, and to allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to service and technical support, or otherwise utilize products or services that you have selected, as well as technical data concerning your computer or traffic data related to your Internet connection. You may also be asked in cases where software is sold pursuant to subscription (“SaaS Products”), to establish an account in order to obtain the service, and establish entitlement to upgrades and updates required for the service to provide ongoing protection in accordance with its function. This information will be used by MVS to ensure you have access to renewal, support and other services.
Our processing and transfer of the data you provide is limited to the following purposes: fulfillment of your order(s)/contract(s), extension/delivering product updates/service-subscriptions or licenses, product registration and activation, customer and technical support as you may request from time to time, processing license renewals as requested by you, automatically processing license renewals if you elect automatic renewal of your subscription and internal (compliance) audits and fraud prevention. You always have the ability to decide whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the transaction or obtain full functionality on the site if the information is essential to complete the transaction or functionality.



			Non-Personal Information We Collect
We collect certain aggregate and non-personal information when users visit our web sites. Aggregate and non-personal information does not relate to a single, identifiable visitor. It tells us general information such as how many users visited our sites and the pages they accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our web sites to our visitors. Through various tracking methods and using log files, we may track domain names, IP addresses, and browser types from those who visit our web sites. We use this information to track aggregate website traffic patterns. Such information is not correlated with any personal information.



			Cookies
MVS may use cookies from time to time. A cookie is a unique text file that a web site can send to your browser software. Cookies enable a web site to tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences. MVS may use cookies to personalize web pages during your visit to our web sites, and/or to remember you for easy navigation and access during your return visits after registering for our products, services and other offers including but not limited to documents, webcasts, events, evaluation software, e-books, etc. For these purposes, some cookies may be tied to your e-mail address.
MVS may also use cookies to track your visit to our web sites in order to collect aggregate data. However, this information will only be used for analytical purposes and will be limited to the minimum necessary to perform the analysis. If you do not want MVS to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser’s privacy settings to reject cookies or to notify you when a web site tries to put a cookie in your browser software. Be aware that rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use of some of the products and/or services at our web sites.



			Participation in Forums
On some of MVS’s websites, we offer you the possibility of participating in online forums. To do so, MVS may require sufficient information to clearly identify you so that, where applicable, we can subsequently identify authors of illegal or other content which does not comply with our requirements. Your personal data is not disclosed to other forum participants unless you have consented to the same in your user profile.



			Sharing Your Information
From time to time, and in jurisdictions where it is permitted, we may provide your information to authorized MVS vendors to communicate to you information or offers about products or services that they believe are important to you. If you prefer that we not provide your information to our business partners, you may let us know using one of the methods described in this policy. MVS provides a number of ways for you to ‘opt-out’ of receiving additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners by ‘opt-out’ options provided at the point of collection, through e-mail notices, or through other preference management that may be available depending on the service or web sites you visit. If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mail newsletters or bulletins you can opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking or replying to the "unsubscribe" button and/or address in the body of the email. In jurisdictions where sharing personal information is prohibited without your ‘opt-in’, no information will be shared without your prior consent.
Some of the software products and/or SaaS Products and services provided by MVS includes transmitting non-personally identifiable data from your use of the software and/or service to third party provider(s) under contract with MVS for purposes of generating data analysis. When such data is transmitted, neither any personal information, nor a user’s screen name is provided to the third party. The analysis and data generated by the third parties is not disclosed to any party other than you. While MVS has instructed its third party partners that they may not store, retain or use any data provided to them other than for the contracted purpose, MVS is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.



			Third Parties
MVS may retain the services of outside contractors to provide services for us (e.g. to deliver products, provide technical support, or handle order and payment processing). We require that all such contractors keep the personal information of our customers secure and confidential. We have contractually bound third parties to such restrictions and require that these contractors provide for appropriate measures to secure the data, that they use personal information only on behalf of MVS, and that they do not share personal information with others or use your personal information for their own marketing purposes.
MVS transmits customer credit card information through a third party payment processor to its third party bank to process and complete credit card transactions. These third parties transmit and store the personal and financial information provided by their customers for credit card transactions through secure systems with security technology, encryption and firewall protection. Please note that these vendors have their own privacy policies, and although MVS’s agreement with them does not allow the other transacting party to use this information for anything other than providing payment services, MVS is not responsible for their actions, including their information protection practices.



			Legal Disclosures
Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for MVS to disclose your personal information to government officials or otherwise as required by applicable law. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to any law enforcement agency or governmental agency except in response to:


				A subpoena, warrant or other process issued by a court of competent jurisdiction;

				A legal process having the same consequence as a court-issued request for information, in that MVS would be in breach of law were it to refuse to provide such information, and it or its officers, executive or employees would be subject to liability for failing to honor such legal process; or,

				Where such disclosure is necessary for MVS to enforce its legal rights pursuant to the laws of the jurisdiction from which such information was gathered, and there is a legal basis to do so.




			Security of Personal Information
We have taken appropriate security measures, consistent with modern information practices, to protect your personal information. These measures include, on our web sites and Internet-enabled technologies, administrative, technical, physical and procedural steps to protect your data from misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction.



			Links to Business Partners and Vendors/Re-Sellers
On certain MVS web sites, we provide links to companies with whom we may have a business relationship. However, MVS is not responsible for the privacy practices of any party to which we provide links, including our business partners. We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours. By clicking on a link to access a non-MVS web site, you are agreeing to submit to that sites’ privacy practices.
