GCU collects both personally identifiable information (PII) and non-personally identifiable information (non-PII) from its visitors. The information collected is used to help us identify our target market and improve the educational services we offer. The collected information is primarily used for marketing purposes and visitors may expect to receive future communication from GCU.
Non-PII is collected automatically through cookies and other web technology. We also collect certain non-PII when you visit our website, such as the browser you are using (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), your operating system (e.g., Windows XP, Mac OS), the domain name from which you receive Internet access, your IP address and aggregate information regarding GCU web pages you access or visit.
PII is collected when a visitor fills out a Request More Information Form, application or otherwise provides information to our website. We provide examples of PII that may be collected below.
To receive additional information about GCU, you can fill out our Request More Information Form by submitting PII, including name, address, phone number and email address. This information is collected so that a university representative can contact you. A phone number is also supplied for those who wish to contact GCU by phone.
