Our privacy policy explains what personal information we collect, your rights in relation to the personal information we hold, who can access your personal information, how long we will keep it, and how you can contact us if you have queries or concerns about our privacy policy.
As part of our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers we record all telephone calls answered in our contact centres. This helps us to identify ways that we can provide you with a better service. Please note that child support calls are not answered through our contact centres and so these calls may not be recorded.
Find out about the information that may be transferred weekly from the Ministry of Social Development to Inland Revenue.
