Our Use of Cookies
Cookies allow us to provide storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. In order to provide the best guest experience possible, we also use cookies for reporting and analysis purposes, such as how guests are shopping on our website, performance of our marketing efforts, and the delivery of relevant marketing messages to each guest. We may also use cookies to manage SuperHeroStuff.com banner advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.
Third Party Use of Cookies
Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve the Google Trusted Badge on our website and to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website. You may opt out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on your prior visits to our website by visiting theÂ Google advertising opt-out page.

If you provide our website with your email address, you may receive emails from us. If you do not want to receive marketing or promotional emails from us, please follow the Unsubscribe link in one of our emails. You will still receive order-related emails (order and shipping confirmation) and product review reminders. Please contact our customer service department if you have further questions about our email communications.
External Links
Our website may offer links to other sites. Other sites have their own policies regarding privacy. If you visit one of these sites, you may want to review the privacy policy on that site. In addition, you may have linked to our website through another site. For example, in certain cases you may have linked to SuperHeroStuff.com.com through banner advertising on another site. In such cases the site you linked from may collect information from people who click on the banner or link. You may want to refer to the privacy policies on those sites to see how they collect and use this information.
Security & Secure Sockets Layering (SSL)
Our website uses Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal credit information, including your credit card number, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online at our website is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the phone.
Warning about Fraudulent Emails
"Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking you for your personal information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.
Safe Shopping Guarantee
Our security measures are designed to prevent anyone from stealing and using your credit card number. In addition, consumer protection laws protect you against the unauthorized use of your credit card. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, if your credit card is used without your authorization, your liability for those fraudulent charges cannot exceed $50. So, if someone steals your credit card or your credit card number, your liability is limited to $50 no matter how much the thief charges to your account. If your credit card provider does hold you liable for any part of this $50, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50. We will cover this liability only if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made at our website while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.
