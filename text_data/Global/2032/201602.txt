For example, one cookie we may store can remember what kind of video capability you have selected, so that you do not have to choose a bandwidth every time you watch a video. In addition, we have authorized various reputable companies to help us track cookies so that we can analyze how people are using the Getty website in order to continually offer the best possible experience for our visitors.  Pixel tags are small pieces of code that may place cookies or provide non personally-identifiable information such as IP address, time of website visit, or browser used.
