Introduction

We apply these same high standards when we protect your Personal Information ("Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to identify the person to whom such information pertains) and Personal Health Information ("Personal Health Information" is defined as any information that combines your Personal Information with known health characteristics).
When you visit HealthyWomen's website, fmxhosting.com/drupal635 (the "Website"), we may request and/or collect a minimal amount of Personal Information and Personal Health Information. This information is requested and/or collected in order to better serve you through the various applications on the Website.

Disclosure of Information
Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, HealthyWomen will not disclose any Personal Information or Personal Health Information it gathers from you on the Website. We may only release Personal Information or Personal Health Information to third-parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information or Personal Health Information to a third-party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described below. 
How is Personal Information Requested and/or Collected and Used at HealthyWomen?
1.	User (Consumer) Surveys - Our user surveys include registering Personal Information, such as name, email address, address, age, last education level attained, profession, ethnicity, primary language, household income, relationship status. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the visitor therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information.
The information gathered from user surveys is used for internal analysis purposes, so that we learn about the profile of our user audience. HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise provide to third parties any individually attributable information. HealthyWomen however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate data and information with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information.

Aggregate Data – HealthyWomen may combine, in a non-identifiable format, the Personal Information and Personal Health Information you provide with information from other users to create a compilation of statistical data ("Aggregate Data") that may be disclosed to third-parties. Aggregate Data does not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you. For example, HealthyWomen may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of a particular third-party site. These third-party websites may use this information to understand community needs and to design appropriate programs and activities on their site. HealthyWomen will not disclose your Personal Information and Personal Health Information to any third-party without your prior permission, except as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.

HealthyWomen, however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate survey data with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information and Personal Health Information.
