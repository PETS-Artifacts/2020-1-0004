DATA SECURITY
AbbVie maintains reasonable technical, administrative and physical controls to secure any Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Sites. However, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that someone will find a way to thwart our security systems. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Information over the Internet, especially your health-related information. AbbVie cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information; therefore, when submitting Personal Information to AbbVie Sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.
LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES AND Social Media Plug-ins
This Privacy Notice does not apply to AbbVie Sites that do not link to this Privacy Notice, or to third-party Web sites to which AbbVie Sites may link. AbbVie Sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit AbbVie Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our AbbVie Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our AbbVie Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our AbbVie Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.

ACCESSING OUR SITES GLOBALLY
This site is owned and operated by AbbVie in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries. Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for personal information is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Notice in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your information in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.

CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY notice
We will only use Personal Information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when the information was collected from you or as authorized by you. However, and subject to any applicable consent requirements, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Notice at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will be reflected on this page with a new effective date. AbbVie encourages you to review this Privacy Notice regularly for any changes. Any Personal Information collected upon your continued use of AbbVie Sites will be handled in accordance with the currently-posted Privacy Notice.
