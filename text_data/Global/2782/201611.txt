Information You Voluntarily Provide
Some of the information that we may obtain will only be collected if you voluntarily provide it to us, such as information provided during registration for a product or service, in response to questionnaires, or during other interactions with us.

Personal Identifying Information You Submit During Registration or in Response to Questionnaires
AbbVie collects Personal Identifying Information that you voluntarily provide on AbbVie Web sites, for example, in order to register for AbbVie programs and services, register to receive marketing products and information, contact AbbVie customer service, or respond to AbbVie questionnaires or surveys. “Personal Identifying Information” means information that identifies you or that could reasonably be used to identify you. Examples of Personal Identifying Information include name, address, telephone number, and email address. When this information is combined with any information on health or medical status, we refer to the resulting information as “health-related information.”
If you choose to register for a program or service or to participate in our interactive services such as questionnaires and surveys, you may disclose health-related information as well as personal facts that could be used to identify you. To protect your privacy, you should not provide AbbVie with any information that is not specifically requested.

Personal Identifying Information You Submit During Other Interactions with AbbVie
You may contact AbbVie to ask questions, discuss your concerns, or report problems regarding our products. If you communicate with or request information from AbbVie personnel, they will have your email address as well as whatever health-related and/or personal facts that you choose to include in your communication.
If you are reporting a product experience, we may ask you for specific facts, including patient initials, age, gender, and prescribing physician. US regulations require us to collect this information in order to file reports with the US Food and Drug Administration regarding the safety of our products.
