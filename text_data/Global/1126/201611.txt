What information do we gather about you?
The information we gather falls into two categories:
 personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, or provide your email address and
tracking information collected as you navigate through our site.
 
Paid Products and Services
While our website is free, we do sell products such as subscriptions and back issues. To enable the purchase of these and other products, we collect and store billing  information. This information will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.
Reader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research
YES! may collect personal information from readers in connection with voluntary surveys. Data may be collected on our website, on the phone or via email. Readers are primarily contacted via email, which link to online surveys, but may occasionally be contacted by telephone or mail. All survey data is reported and/or used in aggregate form only, and no personally identifiable information is released. 
Aggregate Information Collected Through Technology
Cookies and Other Technologies
As is standard practice on many websites, YES! uses “cookies” and other technologies to recognize you to help us understand which parts of our website are the most popular, where our visitors are going and how much time they spend there. We use Google analytics to do some of this collection. We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.
We use the IP address log in an aggregate fashion to track access to our site. Log data is  used in aggregate to analyze usage of our website.
