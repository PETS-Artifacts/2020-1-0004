                                                        prior to providing us with his or her contact information. We reserve the right to limit the number of Referred Persons you can

                                                        information you provide. We may elect NOT to communicate with any Referred Person and/or e-mail address if he/she/it appears to

                                                        Referred Person if (a) the contact information provided by you is incorrect or not valid, (b) such individual has violated any
                                                        provision of these terms or conditions, or (c) we determine in our sole discretion that the participation of such individual
                                                        might be harmful to us, this iHeartMedia Site, any iHeartMedia Internet Service, or any third party for any reason. We
                                                        specifically disclaim any liability for exercising such right.
                                                    

                                                        We may, at our discretion, send you a confirmation using any means available through the iHeartMedia Internet Service, including

                                                        behavior with respect to a referral program, as we determine in our sole discretion, we reserve the right to discontinue the
                                                        iHeartMedia Internet Service to you. We may from time to time offer incentives or rewards in connection with a referral program,
                                                        and any such incentive or reward programs shall be subject to Additional Terms which will be posted at the time such programs

                                                        discretion, to suspend, temporarily or permanently, or cease to provide any and all referral programs without notice, reason or
                                                        liability.
                                                    

                                                        If you are using the iHeartMedia Internet Service to communicate to a Referred Person (or any third party), you agree not to use
                                                        such iHeartMedia Internet Service to harm the Referred Person or any other third party, and/or use such iHeartMedia Internet
