Privacy Policy 

Africa Business Pages is committed to safeguarding its users' privacy. We request all our users to read the following 'privacy policy' to understand how their personal & business information will be treated, as they make full use of our services to their benefit. This policy is applicable only to the entire network of marketplaces operated by Africa Business Pages and not by any other company. 
                                Collection of Information
                                

                                Africa Business Pages collects information from its users when they register to gain access to our services or at other specific instances when they are requested to provide us with their personal & business information. During registration, we ask the users for their name, email address, business information and other personal details. Once a user registers, he/she is no longer anonymous to Africa Business Pages and it is deemed that the user has given Africa Business Pages the right to publish the desired business & personal details throughout its marketplaces, including but not limited to, business directory, trade leads, catalogs etc. 
                                

                                When you are on our network and are asked for personal information, you are sharing the information with Africa Business Pages alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. Promotions that run on our network may be sponsored by companies other than Africa Business Pages or may be co-sponsored by Africa Business Pages and another company. Some or all data collected during a promotion may be shared with the sponsor. If the data will be shared, you will be notified prior to the time of data collection or transfer. You can decide not to participate in the promotion if you don't want your data to be shared.
                                

                                                        We also gather usage statistics such as pages viewed, number of unique visitors, browser software, screen resolution etc. for analysis that helps us provide you improved user experience and services. 
                                

Use of Personal & Business Information 
                                                        Africa Business Pages's primary goal in collecting personal or public information is to provide the user with a customized experience on our network of sites. This includes personalisation services, interactive communications and many other types of services, most of which are completely free. Business information is used to display the user's business listing or product offerings across our network to fetch maximum business opportunities for the user. 
                                In order to provide services free of charge, Africa Business Pages displays advertisements based upon the site usage statistics and visitor trends. 
 
Africa Business Pages uses user's personal & business information to serve targeted advertisements through its websites, newsletters and customised mailers. In addition to it, once the user's personal and business information is displayed on our network, the user may start receiving business enquiries from various buyers and sellers, that might or might not be of their interest. Africa Business Pages does not exercise any control over its users for sending business enquiries to the listed members.

Sharing of Information 
                                                        As a general rule, Africa Business Pages will not disclose or share any of the user's personally identifiable information except when Africa Business Pages has the user's permission or under special circumstances, such as when Africa Business Pages believes in good faith that the law requires it or as permitted in terms of this policy.
                                 

                                                        Africa Business Pages may also disclose account information in special cases when Africa Business Pages has reasons to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating Africa Business Pages's Terms of Services or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Africa Business Pages' rights or property, other Africa Business Pages network website users, or if Africa Business Pages deems it necessary to maintain, service, and improve its products and services. 

                                                        Distribution of Information
                                                        
                                                        Africa Business Pages may, from time to time, send its users emails regarding its products and services. In addition, Africa Business Pages may occasionally send direct mails about products and services of third parties that it feels may be of interest to the user. Only Africa Business Pages or its agents working under confidentiality agreements will send these direct mailings. 

Updation of Information 
                                                        A user may edit his/her account information and profile by logging onto our website and/or by sending a request to admin@africa-business.com. The requested changes may take upto 30 days to appear online because of verification process and server cache policies. 
                                A user account can be deleted or deactivated, but doing so will result in the user not being able to access any members-only area of the network. Residual information will remain within our archive records. 

Protection of information 
                                                        As with all information, Africa Business Pages will never sell any user's personal or business information until and unless it is permitted by the user. Any user statistics that we may provide to prospective advertisers or partners regarding product or service usage on Africa Business Pages network is provided in an aggregate form only and does not include any personally identifiable information about any individual user. 
                                We request our users to sign out of their Africa Business Pages account and close their browser window when they have finished their work. This is to ensure that others cannot access their personal or business information and correspondence, if the user shares the computer with someone else or is using a computer in a public place. 
 
Africa Business Pages takes necessary steps, within its limits of commercial viability and necessity, to ensure that the user's information is treated securely. 
                                                          Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Africa Business Pages strives to protect the user's personal & business information, it cannot ensure the security of any information transmitted to Africa Business Pages and you do so at your own risk. Once Africa Business Pages receives your transmission, it makes best efforts to ensure its security in its systems. Please keep in mind that whenever you post personal & business information online, that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
