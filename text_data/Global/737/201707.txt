				about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners 
				or other companies.
When you register we ask for information such as your name, email 
				address, birth date, gender, address or zip code, occupation, industry, 
				and personal interests. Once you register with the GPWA and sign

				with some of our business partners.
The GPWA automatically receives and records information on our 
				server logs from your browser, including your IP address, GPWA 
				cookie information, and the page you request.

				for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct 
				research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external 
				clients.

We ask that children under age 13 not register with the GPWA because 
				we do not provide services appropriate for their age.

Information Sharing and Disclosure

The GPWA does not rent, sell, or share personal information about 
				you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products 
				or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under 
				the following circumstances: 
				
 
					We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf 
					  of or with the GPWA under confidentiality agreements. These 
					  companies may use your personal information to help the GPWA 
					  communicate with you about offers from the GPWA and our marketing 
					  partners. However, these companies do not have any independent 
					  right to share this information.
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to 
					  establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal 
					  claims;
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, 
					  prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected 
					  fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical 
					  safety of any person, violations of the GPWA's terms of use, 
					  or as otherwise required by law.
We transfer information about you if the GPWA is acquired 
					  by or merged with another company. In this event, the GPWA 
					  will notify you before information about you is transferred and 
					  becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
The GPWA displays 
					  targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers 
					  (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact 
					  with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria 
					  - for example, women ages 25-30 from a particular geographic area.
The GPWA does not provide any personal information to the 
					  advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, 
					  by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the 
					  possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that 
					  you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
The GPWA advertisers include a variety of businesses such 
					  as casinos, travel services, and stores.
