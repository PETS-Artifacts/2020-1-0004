Information Collection and Use; Security of Your Information
Information from Your Interaction with Our Website; Use of Cookies
Like many website owners, IIE receives and records non-personally identifiable information from your browser in the Website server logs. Whenever you request a page through your browser, the navigation and clickstream data, such as IP address, browser (and version), operating system, date, time, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. IIE uses software programs to create summaries from these statistics for such purposes as evaluating content worth, Website and system administration, and anonymous user analysis. We use “cookie” technology on our Website.  Cookies allow us to identify a user’s computer (so, for example, you won’t have to log in every time you visit the Website), and can help make it easier for a user to navigate through the Website (cookies can record a user’s preferences and other data about the user’s Website visit).  Your web browser may allow you to disable cookies, but please realize that doing so may make certain features or pages of the Website unavailable to you.  Except for purposes of enforcing our Terms and Conditions or complying with legal obligations, we do not use this information to identify specific individuals.  
Personal Information Examples
Aside from this standard tracking data, the only personal information we collect about you is such personally identifiable data ("Personal Information") as you knowingly provide to us on the Website. Personal Information can include your name, birth date, gender, email address, physical address and telephone number, financial information and/or other personal information you may provide.
