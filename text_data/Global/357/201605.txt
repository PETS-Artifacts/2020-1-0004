 
We know that you care how information about you is used and safeguarded. Your responses to questionnaires on this Web site are entirely voluntary and will be used, anonymously, in ongoing research by The VIA Institute on Character, the creators of the questionnaires, and other researchers with VIA’s permission. By visiting www.viacharacter.org and completing the questionnaires, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.
What We Collect and How We Use It - Registration
During registration, we ask you to tell us a bit about yourself, including your date of birth, your sex, your Zip Code (or your country if you live outside the U.S.), how much formal education you have received, and your occupation. We use these to tell you how your scores on the questionnaires compare to those of others who are like you in age, gender, geographic location, education, and occupation. We also use them to compute statistics for our research on how these factors affect happiness and strengths.

We also ask you, during registration, to give us your e-mail address, and a name that you would like to use. These are for your benefit. They make it easier for you to remember how to log in here. They make it possible for us to tell you your password if you forget it. And they help you be sure that you are looking at your own records if you share your computer with another user of this site. We display your name when you log in and include it in your printable report. If you do not want to share your real name, you can make up a name.
Provided you have opted-in, we may also use your e-mail address and name to send out e-mail messages with information on how to utilize your strengths and links to resources.
If you register and complete the VIA Survey using a consultant's unique professional link, your information (name, email address and survey results) will be shared with that professional.  Your registration through the professional link will serve as permission to do so.  

You are not required to give us your real e-mail address or name, but we hope that you will in case you need any help with your account. If we receive a request for information about your account, the response will be sent to the registered address, not the one making the request, unless we can verify that the registered address is an invalid or defective address and that the person making the request is the person who created the account.
What We Collect and How We Use It - Questionnaires
We collect your responses to the questionnaires on this site and store these, along with your scores, on our database server. We will never report your individual responses or scores to others, except as described below. We will include your scores and responses in reports, publications, lectures, and Web sites only in summaries of groups of site users. We will not include your responses in the comparisons we provide on this site until there are at least 50 surveys from people in the same category (a geographic area, age range, occupational group, etc.).

You are not required to provide us with any of this data, but if you choose to submit the registration form or any of the questionnaires, you must answer all of the questions to receive your scores.
What We Share
Other researchers have allowed us to use their questionnaires on this Web site. In return, we share your responses with them for their own research. They may receive the responses to their questionnaire, plus the age, sex, geographic location, education, and occupation categories of the person who provided them. They do not receive your name or e-mail address.

For the development and maintenance of this Web site, we contract with Information Technology professionals that might require access to the data collected on this Web site, solely for the purpose of assisting in the operations of this Web site and not for any commercial purpose. These individuals are bound by strict confidentiality requirements.

We may also share this same information with research partners for their own research projects. Again, no identifying information will be included.
How We Use Cookies
We will not place any cookies in your browser without your consent. When cookies are allowed they will only be used to manage each session you have at the web site. The cookies make sure that you and only you are able to view your scores, and will never contain any personal information about you. When you close your browser, or log off the site, these cookies will be deleted .
Information Collected from Children
This Web site is not targeted at children under the age of 13. No one under the age of 13 may create an account on the site. We include one questionnaire suitable for children ages 10 to 17. It assesses a child’s character strengths and provides the results in a rank order list. Those who are under the age of 13 may only complete the assessment under the account of a parent, guardian, or other adult authorized by a parent or guardian. We present sample questions before beginning the survey to help parents decide if it is appropriate for their child. After logging in we ask you to enter a first and last screen name for the child, month and year of birth and gender. The screen name given for the child is used only to label the different children's scores on your account.  You do not have to use the child’s real name. We do not ask for the child's address, geographic location, e-mail address, or other information that could be used to identify or locate a child, except through you. 
Children’s Online Privacy Disclosure for Schools the Teacher Portal (Effective Date: 1/21/15)
This disclosure applies to the use of VIA’s online Teacher Portal, through which VIA may collect personal information from students under the age of 13 via a Registration page that precedes the VIA Youth Survey. VIA’s Youth Survey provides educators with insights into students’ strengths.
1. The types of personal information VIA collects
VIA collects the following personal information from students:


First name and last name


Student ID (optional)


Gender


Month/year of date of birth



2. How VIA uses and shares the information



The personal information of students collected through the Teacher Portal is used to provide the service to the school and its teachers and will be shared with the teacher so that the teacher may associate the survey responses with the student. VIA may also use anonymous survey results for its own research and may share those results with other researchers. VIA will not share any information it collects from the Teacher Portal for any commercial purpose that is unrelated to the school’s use of the VIA Youth Survey.


3. How VIA protects the personal information



VIA takes reasonable technical, administrative, and physical precautions to keep the information secure. For example, we store VIA Youth Survey responses in a password-protected database and data you send to us or we send to you is SSLencrypted.

4. When VIA retains or deletes data

VIA will retain the personal information collected from the Teacher Portal for one school year following the year of collection. This is so teachers and parents can refer back to that data, if they desire to do so. VIA may retain anonymous survey results indefinitely.


5. When this policy may change


VIA retains the right to change this Privacy Statement. If we do, the revised Privacy Statement would apply only prospectively to future data collected. We will provide changes to this page in a prompt manner.
