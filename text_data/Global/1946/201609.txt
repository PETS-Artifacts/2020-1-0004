Use of Cookies
The RAK Free Trade Zone Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
        experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page
        server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
        Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
        domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save
        you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
        to a specific page. For example, if you personalize RAK Free Trade Zone pages, or
        register with RAK Free Trade Zone site or services, a cookie helps RAK Free Trade Zone
        to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process
        of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses,
        and so on. When you return to the same RAK Free Trade Zone Web site, the information
        you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the RAK Free Trade Zone
        features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
        accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies
        if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
        the interactive features of the RAK Free Trade Zone services or Web sites you visit.

        use or disclosure. RAK Free Trade Zone secures the personally identifiable information
        you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
        unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit

        of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
