Individuals have a right to request access to the personal information SATAC holds. If any of the personal information is incorrect in your opinion, you have the right to request the correction of the information.

Our privacy officer deals with such requests and can be contacted by writing to:

Privacy Officer

SATAC
  
  104 Frome Street

Adelaide SA 5000


The primary means for a client to access and amend their information is through SATAC’s web-based services.


SATAC’s Privacy Officer will ensure that any requests for access to personal information or for the correction of personal information not available to clients through SATAC’s web-based services are dealt with in a reasonable period from receiving the request and in accordance with the following procedures.


The Privacy Officer will determine whether SATAC can refuse an individual's request for access to or correction of personal information in accordance with the following:


Access


typically there will be no reason why an individual may not have access to their records
if a request for access is accepted, an individual will be granted access to their personal information in the manner requested by them, providing it is practicable to do so. If the manner requested is not practicable, SATAC will work with the individual to provide access in a manner that is acceptable to both parties

Amendment

a request to amend personal information can be refused if it is not reasonable in the circumstances to make those corrections, having regard to the purpose for holding the information – requests to amend details on academic qualifications sourced and verified by issuing authorities will typically be refused
if a request for correction is accepted, or SATAC is otherwise satisfied that personal information held by it is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, SATAC will take reasonable steps to correct the information
where SATAC refuses to make a correction to personal information requested by an individual, it will, at the request of that individual, take reasonable steps to associate a statement to that personal information to the effect that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading

if SATAC corrects personal information that it has disclosed to another entity it will, at the request of the individual, notify that other entity of the correction, providing that it is lawful and practicable to do so



4.6 Further Use and disclosure of personal information 


  (a) Personal information collected and held by SATAC will only be accessed and used by people employed or engaged by SATAC as required in the fulfilment of their duties and in a manner consistent with the original purpose stated at the time of collection.
  

  (b) SATAC will release applicant enrolment and results information to tertiary education institutions and tertiary admissions centres as required to facilitate the tertiary entrance process on behalf of applicants.
  

  (c) Additional information may be disclosed:
  

  (i) with the individual’s written consent, or
  

  (ii) to reduce or avoid a threat to an individual’s life, health or safety or a serious threat to public health and safety, or
  

  (iii) when the use or disclosure is required or is specifically authorised by law, or
  

  (iv) if the individual is reasonably suspected of being engaged in current or past unlawful activity, and the personal information is disclosed as a necessary part of the investigation or reporting the matter, or
  

  (v) to certain government departments and statutory bodies as required by law
  

  (d) On receipt of information, third parties are responsible for the management, use and disclosure of personal information.
