Making a Purchase
When you make a purchase on the BabyNames.com, we interface with our merchant provider, Stripe.com. Your name and credit card information is sent securely with encryption to the Stripe.com server. No credit card information is stored on BabyNames.com whatsoever, and is completely unrelated to your BabyNames.com user profile.
Your IP Address
BabyNames.com records user IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our site and identify malicious visitors on the message boards. IP addresses remain private, and are not displayed or posted on the site to any other user.

BabyNames.com has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information by third parties. We use SSL encryption, firewall intervention, software and hardware redundancy and a comprehensive data backup schedule. Nonetheless, we cannot guarantee the protection of such information against loss, misuse or alteration.
Opt-In Mailing List
You have the option to add or remove yourself from the monthly newsletter and mailings for special discounts and offers from our partners. We take great care in making sure our users do not receive unwanted email. BabyNames.com sends a periodic newsletter to our members who have opted in to receive it. We will never opt you into our email communications without your permission and we will never sell your information to third parties. IF you receive a special offer from one of our partners, it will always come from our server, as we send them out on the advertiser's behalf. We also ensure that every email you receive from BabyNames.com contains a link to remove yourself from the mailing list. To manage your BabyNames.com email settings, go to our Newsletter Page.
