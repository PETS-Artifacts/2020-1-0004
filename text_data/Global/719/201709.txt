Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you. This allows websites to tailor what you see on the screen. Do you use other technologies which are similar to cookies?Our websites, apps and emails often contain small invisible images known as 'web beacons' or 'tracking pixels'. These are used in a way similar to cookies, to understand when a particular part of a webpage, email or app is viewed.Our apps often use device identifiers in the same way as cookies as used on web browsers. A device identifier is a unique number on your device which allow us to remember your device.We use these similar technologies on websites, emails and apps, for the same purposes and in much the same way as we use cookies on websites. We will use “cookies” and “websites” below as shorthand for “cookies and similar technologies” on “websites, emails and in apps”. What do you use cookies for?Cookies are an important part of the internet. They make using websites much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups: (i) Cookies that are needed to provide the service you have asked forSome cookies are essential so you can move around the website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you've asked for can't be provided. These cookies don't gather information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering your browsing history. For example:Keeping you logged in during your visit; without cookies you might have to log in on every page you go to.When you add something to the online shopping basket, cookies make sure it's still there when you get to the checkout. (ii) Cookies used to improve your browsing experienceThese cookies allow the website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region and they provide improved features. For example:Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences.Remembering if you've filled in a survey, so you're not asked to do it again.Showing you information that's relevant to products of ours that you have.Showing 'related article' links that are relevant to the page you're looking at.Remembering a location you've provided us with to provide local weather forecasts.Linking your browsing history collected by analytics cookies to your registration details to provide you with recommended content and marketingRestricting the number of times you're shown a particular advertisement. This is sometimes called 'frequency capping'.Cookies are also used to enable social media components on our websites, such as embedded content from social media sites such as Facebook or Twitter, share buttons and videos. The cookies are set by the relevant social media provider. For more information about these cookies, including how to set your preferences for these cookies, please refer to the relevant social media provider’s website for more information. (iii) Cookies used to understand how people use our products and services (Analytics)We like to keep track of what pages, links and sections of our apps are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. It's also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our sites and if they get 'error messages' from web pages.We use cookies, which are often called 'analytics cookies', to gather this information. These cookies don't store you contact details (such as your name or postal address). We may, however, combine information collected by analytics cookies with other information that you provide to us. For instance, if you have registered for an account with us, we may combine your contact details other information you provide us with the browsing history from your device collected by analytics cookies (including data collected from before you registered and when you are signed-out). We use this information to provide you with personalised content recommendations and marketing communications. We may also use this combined information to improve our products and services. For instance, we may analyse this information in aggregate to improve our advertising systems. (iv) Cookies used to show advertising that is relevant to youSome advertising, known as “online behavioural advertising” or “OBA” is tailored to you and uses information collected by first party and third party cookies. Please see our Privacy Policy above for further information about how we use online behavioural advertising.We also use cookies in order to know how many advertisements we serve, how many times these are clicked or hovered over with a mouse cursor, how many advertisements we show to a given user and how many customer actions these generate.We also use cookies on our own and advertisers’ sites to understand which customers reach a sale or other action page on an advertiser’s site. This allows us to monitor how many sales or actions we achieve for an advertising client, and therefore, how effective our advertising is.In order to protect our advertisers' brands, we often use a technology that scans the page to ascertain that it is safe from profane, sensitive & potentially brand-negative topics, before serving an ad there. This process is called “ad verification”.We and our advertisers may use information from within our webpages to determine whether you have an ad-blocker enabled. This information may be stored or associated with your device (including through the use of cookies) to re-insert advertisements on our websites and to understand how our customers use ad-blockers. The advertisements that are re-inserted may include those from ad-blockers’ “white lists” or that promote our own products and services.  Our websites do not respond to "Do Not Track" (DNT) browser settings. To change your cookie preferences for advertising and analytics, please see our Privacy Policy and Cookies FAQ’s.  Some of our web pages will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is sometimes used to tell that other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. Your cookie choicesPlease note that our website, apps and other products and services may not work correctly (or at all) if you change your preferences. For example, you may not be able to purchase products via our websites. However, you may still be able to place an order via our telephone order line.

For more information on how to achieve this, please see our Privacy Policy and Cookies FAQ’s.You can usually prevent the operation of web-beacons by changing your web-browser cookie settings and your ad choices, or for those in emails, by switching off images in your email client or viewing emails using only the “text” display (rather than “HTML” display”). See the “Help” section of your email client for instructions. You can opt-out of analytics cookies on this website on our "Controlling online behavioural advertising and other third party cookies” page. Where you use our apps, similar technologies to cookies are used for analytics. It is not presently possible to opt-out of these similar technologies.
