                MyRegistry collects and may track (1) the e-mail addresses of member visitors that communicate with MyRegistry via e-mail, (2) information knowingly provided by the visitor in online forms, registration forms (including registration forms completed through a Partner Website (“Partner Website” is defined as a third party company that is using the MyRegistry.com gift registry software to allow you to sign up for the Site)), order forms, surveys, e-mail, the "Contact Us" section of the Site, other inquiries visitors may make through the Site, and other online avenues (including, but not limited to, information such as demographic, business profile, and personal profile data), (3) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of member visitors to the Site, and (4) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site member visitors access. MyRegistry web servers may seek to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to identify the computer when it visits MyRegistry again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to, and throughout, certain areas of our Site, and navigation to MyRegistry promotions on third party Web sites.

When a member visitor performs a search within the Site, MyRegistry may record information identifying the member visitor or linking the member visitor to the search performed. MyRegistry may also record limited information for every member visit and search request, for example, in the form of a Web or Site log, and use that information to provide member visitors with a better experience while visiting our Site, to solve technical problems with the services available directly or indirectly in connection with the Site, and to calculate overall usage statistics.
