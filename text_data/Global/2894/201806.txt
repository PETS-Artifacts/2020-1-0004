We have implemented the following Google services on our web site:

Google Display Network Impression Reporting
Demographics and Interests Reporting
Google Analytics Advertising Features
Google Adwords Remarketing
Google Analytics Remarketing

We along with third-party vendors, such as Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our web site.
Google Analytics Advertising Features enables data to be collected via cookies (including the Google Analytics cookie and Google advertising cookies), about our web site's traffic. Such data is not personally identifiable. We have set our Google Analytics account to not automatically expire the data that is collected on our web site, as we use such data to optimize our advertising and improve our web site.
Google Adwords Remarketing and Google Analytics Remarketing are services that use cookies (using information that is not personally identifiable) to serve ads based on someone's past visits to our web site. This may employ use of the DoubleClick cookie. This results in other web sites showing our advertisements to users that have previously visited our web site.
Google Analytics was enhanced to automatically take advantage of cross-device remarketing functionality that was already available in Adwords and DoubleClick. This allows us to reach customers across devices through Google Analytics Audiences. If someone visits our web site on one device, we can now reach them with more relevant ads when they search or browse on another device. Where users have chosen to enable Google to associate their web and app browsing history with their Google account, and to use information from their Google account to personalize ads, Google will use data from its signed-in users together with our Google Analytics data to build audience lists for cross-device remarketing. In order to support this feature, two things happen: First, for users on our site, Google Analytics will collect Google-authenticated identifiers associated with users' Google Accounts (and therefore, personal information). Second, Google Analytics will temporarily join these identifiers to our Google Analytics data in order to support our audiences.
Payments
We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we may use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors). In such a case, your payment card details will beprovided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of payment information.
Third-party disclosure
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include web site hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our web site, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
Links to Other Sites
Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.
We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.						
COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act) and Minors
When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of web sites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under 13.
We do not intentionally sell or market to anyone under the age of 18.  If you are under 18 years of age, you are only authorized (to the applicable extent of the law) to use this web site with the supervision and permission of a parent or guardian.
We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.
CAN-SPAM Act
The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
We collect your email address in order to:

Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.
Process orders/reservations, and to send information and updates pertaining to orders/reservations.
We may send you additional information related to your product and/or service.
Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our clients after the original transaction has occurred.

To be in accordance with CAN-SPAM we agree to the following:

NOT use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.
Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.
Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.
Allow users to unsubscribe by using a link at the bottom of each marketing-related email.

If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can notify us via email at support@americandiscountcruises.com
Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
We will let you know via email and/or a  notice on our Service, prior to the change becoming effective and update the "effective date" at the top of this Privacy Policy.
You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
