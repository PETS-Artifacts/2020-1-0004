Collection, use and retention of personal information
This privacy statement, together with any other documents, policies, notices or other statements referred to herein sets out the basis on which we process personal information about you. Personal data is information that can identify a specific individual such as name, physical and/or email address and telephone number. If during your visit to this website you order products or services, enter a competition or promotion or otherwise submit information to us e.g., by filling in forms or responding to surveys, you are choosing to provide us with your personal information. You agree that it will be used to provide the information, products or services you request (including information on additional products and/or services which BP reasonably thinks may be of interest to you), and to help us understand how visitors use this website, in order that we can improve the visitor experience on this site.
Where you have subscribed to receive our newsletter(s), we are able to ensure you receive further related and informative communications by following your interactions with that communication, such as whether you receive, open or click on a link within an email communication. We offer you the option to unsubscribe in all our further communications.
For more information see the “Direct marketing” section below. Further, you may choose to provide personal information via our website to a third party - for more information on whose privacy statement applies see the “Hyperlinks and embedded functionality” section below.
Personal information is held by us from the date of collection for the purposes of providing you with the requested products or services, after which time it may be deleted or aggregated so that it no longer directly identifies you.
Keeping personal information accurate and access
We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is kept accurate and up to date. However, we can only make changes to your personal information if you notify us. It is your responsibility to let us know if there are inaccuracies or changes to your personal information. Please notify us at www.bp.com/contact if there are any changes to or inaccuracies in your personal information, providing us with sufficient information to enable us to identify you, so that any changes can be made.
In accordance with our internal policies you may ask us to provide you with access to any personal data we process about you. If you want access to your personal information contact www.bp.com/contact. We may be able to charge you for providing such access.
Security
Transmission of information via the internet is not always secure. We cannot guarantee the security of your data while being transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. However, once we have received your information, we take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorised access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorised modification or unlawful destruction or accidental loss of personal information once it is under our control. 
Disclosures and transfers of personal information
Subject to the “Hyperlinks and embedded functionality” section below, BP does not sell or otherwise release your personal information to third parties to allow them to direct market their products and services to you. In order to provide our products and services we may, however, need to share your personal information with other companies within the BP Group, and/or third-party service providers that process data on our behalf. If you submit personal information to BP, you agree to such disclosure.  
Since BP operates globally, BP may want to transfer your personal information to other countries, including countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA). However, while in our control, we always seek to ensure that your personal information receives the same level of protection as it would had it stayed within the EEA, including seeking to ensure that it is kept secure and used only in accordance with our instructions and for the agreed purpose(s).
We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, request from a regulator or any other legal process served on BP. In the event that BP is subject to a takeover, divestment or acquisition we may disclose your personal information to the new owner of the business.

You agree that BP may send you marketing communications in line with your previously expressed marketing preferences. If you no longer wish to receive such, please contact us at www.bp.com/contact to modify your preferences, or follow the opt-out instructions contained in each marketing communication.
