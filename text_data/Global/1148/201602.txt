As a result, you acknowledge and agree that VII assumes no liability, responsibility or obligation to transmit, process, store, receive or deliver transactions or Postings or for any failure or delay associated with any Postings and you are hereby expressly advised not to rely upon the timeliness or performance of the Site for any transactions or Postings. Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion of certain warranties or certain limitations on damages and remedies; accordingly some of the exclusions and limitations described in this Agreement may not apply to you.
16. INDEMNIFICATION.
You agree to indemnify, defend and hold the Channel and VII, and any of their successors and assigns, and any of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives, licensors, Advertisers, suppliers, and operational service providers harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, losses, expenses, damages and costs (including reasonable attorneys' fees), resulting from any breach or violation of this Agreement by you, your use of the Site or the public posting or other permitted use of your Postings.
VII reserves the right to assume, at its sole expense, the exclusive defense and control of any such claim or action and all negotiations for settlement or compromise, and you agree to fully cooperate with VII in the defense of any such claim, action, settlement or compromise negotiations, as requested by VII.
17. ADS AND MALWARE.
We take great care and pride in creating this Site. We are always on the lookout for technical glitches that effect how the Site works. When we find them on our end, we will fix them. Unfortunately, your home computer may cause some glitches that effect how you see our Site -- and that is beyond our control.
If you experience any unusual behavior, content or ads on the Site, it may be the result of Malware on your computer. Malware‚Äö√Ñ√Æshort for MALicious softWARE‚Äö√Ñ√Æis a term used to broadly classify a form of software which is installed in a computer system with malicious intentions, usually without the owner's knowledge or permission. Malware includes computer viruses, key loggers, malicious active content, rogue programs and dialers, among others. While we continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that everything on the Site is working properly, sometimes Malware programs on your personal computer may interfere with your experience on our Site and on other sites that you visit.
We suggest that you take some of the following actions which may help to clean your computer and which could prevent future installations of Malware.
Please note that we cannot be responsible for the effects of any third-party software including Malware on your Device. Please make sure to carefully read the Help or Customer Support areas of any software download site.   If you do discover any Malware on your Device, we also suggest you speak with a qualified computer technician.

To the extent it may be applicable, you and VII agree to opt out from and expressly exclude any applicability of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act. If any Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, YOU AND VII WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, operational service providers (as defined below) and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Service Providers") to, for example, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or other content ("Targeting Services"), serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site.  Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, application or other interactive services you have visited. See Section 5(b)(i)(A) for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.
Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see "Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers" section below and "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.
We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies.  For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site.
Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Targeting Services or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.

i.  Tracking Technologies Set By Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, you have a number of options:

A. Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site for Targeting Services to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests.   Your opt-out options regarding these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers are described below.

You can opt-out of the use of Other Information for certain advertising purposes by using opt-out tools provided by certain Third Party Service Providers as described here. You can access the Adobe Audience Manager (formerly known as Demdex) tool and Google's DoubleClick tool.  If you use such opt-out tools, your choices only apply to the Third Party Service Providers identified in such link.  Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.
In addition to the Third Party Service Providers listed above, other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool and/or the Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising.  For example, click here for more information on some Third Party Service Providers that we use to provide online behavioral advertising.  Please click on the links to these tools to learn more about your choices.  Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.
Nielsen Measurement: The player on this website may feature Nielsen's proprietary measurement software which will collect and use certain video viewing metrics and other information, in accordance with Nielsen's digital measurement privacy policy. For more information about Nielsen's measurement software, see http://www.nielsen.com/digitalprivacy and see the "Choices" section of that digital measurement privacy policy to learn about your choices with respect to Nielsen's measurement, including your opt-out options if you do not wish to participate in such measurement and the scope of any opt-out options.
You may also prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as further described here.  Please note that using those controls shall affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.
See the "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers.


ii. Tracking Technologies Set By the Site.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:

You can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as further described here.  Please note that using those controls shall affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.
See the "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site.

This Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Click here for more information about this Site and online behavioral advertising.
iii.  More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:

The tools discussed above are "Internet browser cookie based."  This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser (a process described above) after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise Site's personalization opt-out when you are not logged in, and then delete browser cookies, you may need to use the Site's personalization opt-out tool again.
The above tools are "Internet browser and Device-specific"  Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device.  This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9.
Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.  Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.  For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.
You shall still receive advertisements.  Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers‚Äö√Ñ√¥, Advertisers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties, unless such frequency capping is provided through Tracking Technologies set by the Site or unless you opt-in through alternative means that may be offered by us to enable such functionality.  Furthermore, as described above (see "Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies" section above), even if you delete third party Tracking Technologies, we may enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies, for example, to ensure you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly or to limit how often you see advertisements.
Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.  Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.
How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies). Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.  Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html.  If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.
Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.  In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, unless we offer alternative means to enable such functionality, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings or other purposes described in "Other Information Collected By Us" in Section 4(b) above, and some of our other services may not function properly.  In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), unless we offer alternative means to enable such functionality, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.
Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5(b)(iii) and in Sections 5(b)(i) and (ii).

The Site may also offer services and features, such as events and Promotions, that we put together with another company ("Co-Branded Partner") and that may be hosted on the Site and/or our Co-Branded Partner's or a Promotion-specific website, application or other interactive service. The Co-Branded Partner shall be identified on the co-branded feature or service and, in connection with any disclosure to the Co-Branded Partner of Personal Information for marketing purposes, you shall be given the opportunity to opt into the disclosure to the Co-Branded Partner for marketing purposes of Personal Information collected as part of the co-branded service or feature and be provided with a link to the Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.  If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of such Personal Information for marketing purposes, you shall need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly and the use of such information by Co-Branded Partner is subject to Co-Branded Partner's privacy policy.  Please note that your Information may be shared with Co-Branded Partners for purposes of administering or conducting the co-branded services and features (but not for marketing purposes) without an opt in (for example, if the Co-Branded Partner is administering a Promotion you have entered, your Information may be shared with the Co-Branded Partner so that the Co-Branded Partner can verify your eligibility and/or contact you if you are a potential winner).
iv.  Disclosure to Operational Service Providers. We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining the Site's services, features, functions and operations.  We shall refer to these third parties as "operational service providers".  We use operational service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content, activities, services, features and functions we bring you and we disclose your Information to operational service providers for the purpose of providing services to us.
v.  Disclosure to Certain Other Third Parties.   In addition to the above, we shall make your Personal Information available to certain third parties in the following limited circumstances:

When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process) or if requested by a governmental agency or other authority as part of an investigation;
If we believe your actions violate any law, rule, regulation and/or the Terms of Use Agreement, including, without limitation, this Privacy Policy or Additional Terms;

If you opt-in or otherwise agree to have your Personal Information shared with or otherwise disclosed to a third party for marketing or other purposes, in which case the third party's use of your Information is subject to the third party's own privacy policy;
If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate: to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries; to protect our business and assets or the rights, property or safety of the Channel, VII, or any of its or their operational service providers, licensors, suppliers, Advertisers, customers, users, or any other party; to limit our legal liability; to defend our interests; to enforce this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use Agreement and/or to comply with our legal, regulatory, audit and compliance obligations or requests by law enforcement or other governmental agencies or authorities and/or
In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, sale, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or VII.


b.  Sharing and Disclosure of Other Information.  We may share Other Information with or otherwise disclose Other Information to third parties, but we do not disclose Personal Information to them except as described in this Privacy Policy.
8.  Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Information.
Generally, you may review, update or delete certain Information collected by the Site, if you are a registered user of the Site and logged into the Site, by clicking "My Account" at the top of the Site and then selecting "Edit Personal Information".  However, Personal Information that is necessary to check eligibility, such as date of birth or age, cannot be deleted, but may be modified with sufficient verification of the correct information.  We will allow you to change the password portion of your User ID, as well as certain other Information you have given us in order to keep your information current.
Certain Information collected for certain entries into Promotions are subject to corporate and regulatory recordkeeping requirements and will not be deleted upon the user's request, unless the entrant is a child under the age of 13 years old.
If the burden or expense of providing access to your Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such Information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and contact information for further inquiries.
Children or Ineligible Teenagers.  If we, or VII, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of the Site or certain features of this Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "Parent") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.  The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state or country).
In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the Terms of Use Agreement to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may contact us via the Contact Us page  and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration.  If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to contact us via the Contact Us page and include the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth.  The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. The Site will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration and may provide further information or request additional information before terminating the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account, .  The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.  The Site will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.
We will not allow direct access to a user's account and Personal Information by any person without the user's User ID.
9.  Protection of Information.
While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we maintain commercially reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Information.  However, regardless of our efforts and the Device you use to access the Site, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission.  While no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure from intrusion, we conduct financial transactions via secured transmissions but may not always secure other parts of the Site.  We also limit our employees‚Äö√Ñ√¥ access to Information collected by the Site to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such Information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality shall be subject to our disciplinary processes.  We request that our operational service providers follow similar standards of security and confidentiality.
Phishing.  Phishing attacks attempt to steal consumers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ personal identity data and financial account credentials.  "Phishers" use ‚Äö√Ñ√≤spoofed‚Äö√Ñ√¥ e-mails to lead consumers to counterfeit websites designed to trick recipients into divulging Information such as credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords and social security numbers.  WE DO NOT SEND EMAILS ASKING YOU TO PROVIDE OR CONFIRM CREDIT CARD NUMBERS, SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS OR YOUR USERNAME OR PASSWORD!  If you receive such email communication, please contact us via the Contact Us page, and then immediately delete the fraudulent email from your computer.
10. Your California Privacy Rights.
If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with notice and choice over disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties (such as Advertisers) for marketing purposes (see "Sharing and Disclosure of Personal Information" above).  Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, the notice and choice we provide regarding disclosure of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes (and this Section) satisfies our obligation to otherwise maintain or furnish users with a list of the names and addresses of third parties who receive Personal Information from us for marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and have additional questions on our sharing of your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes, you may send us your questions by email to the Privacy Administrator at privacy@viacom.com.

We shall not accept requests via postal mail, telephone or facsimile. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or may not be able to respond if you do not provide complete information.
11.  Changes to this Privacy Policy and Notice.
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy at any time by posting an updated Privacy Policy without advance notice to you.  Such revisions shall be effective immediately upon posting.  Notice of material changes may be posted on the Site's homepage and/or may be provided by e-mailing you or notifying you upon login about these changes; the form of such notice is at our discretion.

We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including without limitation, a registered user, of any services, features or functions of the Site if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access the user's account or any services, features or functions.
Further, if you use any of the Communities features and functions made available on or through the Site, please remember that any Information disclosed in these venues is automatically made public and please use caution when disclosing any Personal Information in the Communities, as you do not know who may access and use your Personal Information or for what purposes.

We will also send a notification to the user who posted the material, at the email address provided by the user in connection with his or her account with us, telling the user that the material was removed or access to it was blocked because of claimed infringement.
If you are a user who posted material that was removed in response to a notice of infringement and you believe that material was removed due to mistake or misidentification, you may request that we replace the posting by sending us a counternotice as follows:
You must send the counternotice to our designated agent for receiving notices of infringement, whose name and contact information is above.

When we receive a counternotice that complies with these requirements, we reserve the right, but not the obligation, to restore the material that was removed after forwarding a copy of the counternotice to the person who sent the notice of infringement and waiting at least 10 business days.  If, during those 10 business days, the person who sent the original notice of infringement notifies us that such person has instituted a suit to seek a court order to restrain the user from infringing activity relating to the material on our website, we will not replace the material.  Otherwise, we may repost the material at our discretion.  However, pursuant to the Section of the Terms of Use Agreement entitled "Postings", we retain the right to remove, block access to, or not restore material at any time for any reason without any liability to the posting user.  In particular, a user who sends a counternotice pursuant to this Copyright Compliance Policy expressly acknowledges and agrees that we shall not be liable to the user under any circumstances for declining to replace material.
