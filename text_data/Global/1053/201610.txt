Privacy & Personally Identifiable Information
GreatAuPair has a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our members' Personally Identifiable Information.
We collect personally identifiable information such as first and last name, birthdate, email address, a home, postal or other physical address 
		or phone number from guests and members during the registration and payment processes and, occasionally, at other times. Information collected by 
		GreatAuPair is securely stored by physical and electronic means. Data collected by GreatAuPair will be shared with third parties only in ways 
		that are described in this privacy policy and will not be sold or rented on an individual basis to independent third parties without your 
		knowledge or permission. By accepting the GreatAuPair Terms of Use, you acknowledge and grant permission to GreatAuPair to use your Personal 
		Contact Information as specifically stated under Uses of Personal Contact Information, herein, on GreatAuPair and its Childcare Network 
		Affiliate websites.
Search engines may index publicly available information from your profile, such as your first name, that is searchable by anyone on the Internet.
		Search engines do not have access to any Personal Contact Information contained within the fields of a profile, some of which is available only
		to paid members of the GreatAuPair service. Personal Contact Information is defined as first and last name together, email address, phone number
		and physical street address. We also collect your credit card number if you make a purchase. With your permission, we will also supplement data
		through a background check as needed to satisfy U.S. Department of State Au Pair Program Requirements and or for pre-employment screening.
Uses of Personal Contact Information
Paid members may see your first and last name listed on your profile. You have the option of providing your phone number, which you may elect 
		to display or not display to paid members; either families or care providers who are claiming to seek a working relationship with you as a 
		result of your online registration. Your email address is not visible to anyone, except to those whom you directly send an email during the 
		time you have a paid subscription. Your physical address is not revealed on the website. A map showing the location of your city or zip code 
		is available and may be seen by registered users. No representations or warranties are made regarding the legitimacy of the claims of those 
		who have paid for a membership subscription to contact you through GreatAuPair's private messaging system which relies on your Personal 
		Contact Information. You are urged to validate the identity of anyone who contacts you and utilize the background check resources available 
		to you through GreatAuPair and the Childcare Network before making any commitments or arrangements. We do not sell, share, rent or trade 
		personally identifiable information with third parties for their promotional purposes.
The information you provide during registration may also be used to enable us to process, validate and verify services or membership 
		subscription purchases. We may also provide advertisers with aggregate - never individual - information about our member base and usage 
		patterns. We may also use aggregated information to develop new features and services to better meet member needs.
Internally we may use aggregated and personally identifiable information to improve our marketing efforts, to statistically analyze site 
		usage, to improve our content and product offerings as well as to customize our site's content and layout. We believe these uses allow 
		us to improve our site and better tailor your online experience to meet your needs.
We also may use personally identifiable information about you to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your 
		interests, such as GreatAuPair news, updates, promotions, Favorites notifications or FastMatch emails. You may opt out of receiving 
		such automated information services at any time by signing in to your account: click My Account then click Preferences in the 
		sub-navigation menu to select your email preferences.
Users also may post third party personally identifiable information, such as name and email for referral purposes. This information is 
		used only for the purposes which it was collected.
We use personally identifiable information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use.
