                                What kinds of data does Microsoft collect?
                            Microsoft collects data to help you do more. To do this, we use the data we collect to operate and improve our software, services, and devices, provide you with personalized experiences and to help keep you safe. These are some of the most common categories of data we collect. 
                                Web browsing and online searches
                            Like many search engines, we use your search history, and the history aggregated from other people, to give you better search results. To speed up web browsing, Microsoft web browsers can collect and use browsing history to predict where you want to go. Cortana can make personalized recommendations based on your browsing and search history.

    You can choose whether your browsing history is collected via the Feedback and Diagnostics Setting in your Windows privacy settings. You can also manage whether Cortana has access to your search and browsing history in the Cortana and Microsoft Edge settings.

                                Places you go
                            Location information helps us give you directions to the places you want to go and show you info relevant to where you are. For this, we use the locations you provide or that we’ve detected using technologies like GPS or IP addresses.Detecting location also helps us protect you. For example, if you almost always sign in from Tokyo, and suddenly you’re signing in from London, we can check to make sure it’s really you. You can turn on or off location services for your device in Settings > Privacy > Location.  From here, you can also choose which Windows Store apps have access to your location and manage the location history stored on your device.To view and clear location data that's been associated with your Microsoft account, go to account.microsoft.com.Learn more about Windows 10 and locationRead about location in the Privacy Statement

                                Information from device sensors
                            As you’d expect from any modern device, most Windows 10 phones, tablets, and PCs come with sensors—ways for the device to detect the world. That can be your phone’s microphone or accelerometer, your laptop’s fingerprint scanner, an internal GPS sensor, and more.On Windows 10 devices, you control what sensor data the device and the apps can use in Settings > Privacy. 
                                    Windows 10 and your online services 
                                With Windows 10 as a cloud-powered service, data helps us continually protect and improve your experience. For example, to help keep you safe online, we automatically scan Windows 10 devices for known malware. We also use telemetry, which is ongoing information we receive about how your Windows 10 system is operating, to keep your device running well. So if we know there’s a problem with a particular kind of printer driver, we can send the right drivers only to the people who use that kind of printer.We also provide you with a number of controls for how information is used to deliver personalized services and experiences in Windows 10. You can adjust your Windows 10 privacy settings for everything from basic telemetry to personalized services at any time by going to Settings > Privacy > Feedback & diagnostics.
