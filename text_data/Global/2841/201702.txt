Thank you for your interest in our privacy statement.
If you are only browsing this website, we do not capture data that allows us to identify you individually.
If you provide us with your personal information for the purpose of signing up for a programme, subscribing to a publication, registering for an event, renting premises or for any other service provided by NParks, we will use that information for the purposes of providing that service to you.
If necessary, we may share this data with other Government agencies (or non-Government entities which have been authorised to carry out specific NParks services), in order to serve you in the most efficient and effective way, unless such sharing is prohibited by legislation.
For your convenience, we may also display to you data you had previously supplied us or other Government agencies. This will speed up the transaction and save you the trouble of repeating previous submissions. Should the data be out-of-date, please supply us the latest data. We will retain your personal data only as necessary for the effective delivery of public services to you.
To safeguard your personal data, all electronic storage and transmission of personal data are secured with appropriate security technologies.
This site may contain links to non-Government sites whose data protection and privacy practices may differ from ours. We are not responsible for the content and privacy practices of these other websites and encourage you to consult the privacy notices of those sites.
Our privacy statement may change from time to time. Any updates to the privacy policy statement will be posted on this page.Â
