        CanLII calls upon users accessing its services a large number of times to ensure that they are people and not programs acting on command. 
        Indeed, massive downloads are prohibited by CanLIIâ€™s Terms of Use. Though your own use may be quite limited, it may have been compiled with that of others 
        in your organization and in the end, the total volume of access is high.
