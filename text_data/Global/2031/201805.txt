Our Privacy Policy - No Nonsense Summary
Why we provide this policy
In the course of visiting our web site, our web server will exchange data with your web browser - including the web pages you request, associated images and scripts and cookies as described below. In addition, if you wish to post messages to our forum we will ask you to provide a valid e-mail address. If you order anything from us we will, of course, require further information. This Policy tells you what data we keep and what we use it for. It also tells you what we will not use it for.
What we will not do with your data
We will not pass any collected personal data to a third party (unless legally required to do so), nor will we use it to distribute un-solicited commercial e-mail (spam).
We will not use your e-mail address, or any other personal data that you may choose to provide, for any purpose other than that for which it is supplied.
What we will do with data
We will use our web server logs to analyse the use of our web site.
When you visit J2Ski.Com, your IP Address (the unique address of your computer on the Internet) is recorded in our log files, along with the pages visited. These logs are standard Apache Web Server logs and may contain information allowing us to analyse when and how each visitor arrived at our site, which other web site(s) sent (referred) them and how long they stayed.
The Server Logs do not tell us who you are or where you live.
Analysing this data in a generic fashion allows us to determine patterns of usage and improve the content of our site for the benefit of all our visitors.
What we may do with data
If you provide us with your e-mail address (required to post in our forum) we may occasionally send you short e-mails informing you of changes to our site that may interest you.
We may be required from time to time, by applicable law or legal order, to provide data to law enforcement and governmental agencies.
Information we collect
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server records the IP address of the visitor, the referrer (the address of the web site whose link was followed to find ours), and the pages and files accessed on our server.
We may resolve the IP address to also collect the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web pages.
For visitors who voluntarily register to post messages to our forum, and who communicate with us via e-mail, we will record their e-mail address(es).
The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and occasionally to notify visitors about updates to our Web site; it is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.
Our use of Google Analytics - PLEASE READ
In order to understand the needs of our users, we use features of Google Analytics that report estimated demographic information.
To provide this information, Google may set and use additional cookies.

You can control the information Google associates with your web activity (in Google's words you can "opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads") using the Google Ads Settings.
You can also use the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
Our use of Cookies
We use "Cookies" (small files downloaded and maintained by your browser) to record session information, such as items that consumers add to their shopping cart, certain pages that users access or visit, or to ensure that visitors are not repeatedly sent the same banner ads.
