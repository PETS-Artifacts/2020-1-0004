Collection of Your Information
Information You Provide to Us
When you use the Services, we may collect and store personal information that you provide to us, including, among other information: your name; address; phone number; email address; and credit card number or other payment details.For example, we collect this information when you fill out an online form, contact us for information or customer support, register to use a service, make a purchase, and request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products).   If you do not wish to have your payment details stored, please contact Customer Support at the number listed below.
In order to tailor our communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. You always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.
The Services may enable you to send communications to us or to third parties, such as through our live chat feature. All such communications become our property once you submit them. Whenever you choose to initiate these kinds of communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return.Please use your discretion when deciding whether and what to communicate. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, edit or delete communications transmitted to us or that are made publicly available on the Services. This reservation of rights shall not under any circumstances obligate us to conduct such edits or deletions, nor shall it cause us to be liable for any such edits or deletions.
Automatically-Collected Information
We may automatically collect information about how you access and use the Services. For example, we may collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, the pages you view, the services you use, the date and time of your visit, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our websites, error logs, and other hardware and software information.  Fortinet maintains log files of the traffic that visits our sites. We do not link any information gathered in these log files to personal information. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service.We may use third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, and various technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. We may use this information to formulate statistical models about use of the Services, enhance the Services for our users, and provide you with tailored content and advertising.To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on by clicking here
We may also employ certain applications, such as the various components of Security Center, to retrieve information about your computer system to assist us in the provision of services that you have chosen to subscribe to or use. This information is essential to enable us to provide you with quality service, and for that reason there is no opt-out available for this information collection.
Our Use of Cookies. This Services may use “cookie” technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer or device.  We use cookies to identify customers when they visit our sites. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of the Services. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so that we don't ask them to enter their email and password with every visit.Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, the information we collect with cookies is not sold, rented, or shared with any outside parties.We do not use cookies to obtain or retain any personal information about you apart from what you voluntarily provide us. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this). Please note that if you decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Services.For example, we cannot provide subscription services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.
Tailored Advertising.  The Services may include third party tailored ad technology which enables customized ads to be displayed to you through the Services. We do not share information that is intended to identify you personally with these third parties; however, when you use the Services, we or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use device or similar information that is collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, or similar technologies to ensure that appropriate ads are presented and to perform analytics concerning your use of the Services and other websites tracked by these third parties. These technologies also may control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties’ privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties.
If you are interested in more information about tailored ads and your choices to prevent third parties from delivering tailored ads, you may visit the following third party websites: the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Page.  You can also visit the Google Ad Settings page to opt out of receiving tailored ads from Google.Please note that to the extent ad technology is integrated into the Services, you may still receive ads even if you opt-out of tailored ads. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, the opt-out services provided by the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance are controlled by those third parties, not Fortinet, and Fortinet does not control which companies choose to participate in those programs.
Do Not Track. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the various advertising opt outs above.However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.
Information from Third Parties
We may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others.We may combine information that we collect from or about you with information we obtain about you from such third parties and affiliates and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide.
