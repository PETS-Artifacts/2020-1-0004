Certain Fortinet Services make certain information they collect available to the customer that manages the service.  For details about that customer’s handling of the data, please contact that customer. 
We conduct the above activities on the basis of our legitimate interests in operating our business and protecting our customers.  Where appropriate, these activities also are conducted on the basis of consent.
2.  Privacy Practices Specific to Fortinet Websites
     a.  Information Collected Through the Fortinet Websites
When you use the Fortinet Websites, we may collect information when you provide information directly to us and when we passively collect information from you.
                                i.     Information You Provide to Us Through the Fortinet Websites
Such information you may provide to us may include, without limitation, your name; address; phone number; email address; and credit card number or other payment details. For example, we collect this information when you fill out an online form, contact us for information or customer support, register to use a service, make a purchase, and request certain features (e.g., newsletters, updates, and other products).  
In order to tailor our communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, experience with our products, and more detailed contact preferences. You always have the option of choosing not to provide us with this information.
We may enable you to send communications to us or to third parties, such as through our live chat feature. All such communications become our property once you submit them.  Without limiting the foregoing, when you provide us with suggestions or feedback for any of our products and services, you grant us an irrevocable, exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, worldwide license to use, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, distribute and sublicense the suggestions or feedback.  When you choose to initiate communication with us, or anyone else, you may be contacted in return. Please use your discretion when deciding whether and what to communicate. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to monitor, edit or delete communications transmitted to us or that are made publicly available on the Fortinet Websites, but we have no obligation to do so, and we will not be liable for any such edits or deletions.
                              ii.     Information Collected Automatically Through the Fortinet Websites
We may automatically collect information about how you access and use the Fortinet Websites. For example, we may collect and store information such as your browser type, IP address, language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Fortinet Websites, the pages you view, the services you use, the date and time of your visit, the websites you visited immediately before and after visiting our websites, error logs, and other hardware and software information.  Fortinet may maintain logs of the traffic that visits the Fortinet Websites. Log files are used to manage traffic loads and information technology requirements for providing reliable service and for other purposes described in this Privacy Policy. We may use third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, and various technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. We may use this information to formulate statistical models about use of the Fortinet Websites, enhance the Fortinet Websites for our users, and provide you with tailored content and advertising. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information in a particular browser for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on by clicking here
Cookies. The Fortinet Websites may use cookie technology and similar online tools, such as web beacons and web pixels. “Cookies” are small files that a website stores on a user’s computer or device.  We use cookies to identify customers when they visit our sites. Cookies are used to remember user preferences and maximize performance of the Fortinet Websites. Additionally, cookies help us to identify returning users so that we don't ask them to enter their email and password with every visit. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may set your browser to block cookies (consult the instructions for your particular browser on how to do this). Please note that if you decide to block cookies, this may interfere with your ability to perform certain transactions, use certain functionality, and access certain content on the Fortinet Websites.
Tailored Advertising.  The Fortinet Websites may include third-party cookies and other ad technology that enables customized ads to be displayed to you through the Fortinet Websites and elsewhere online. When you use the Fortinet Websites, we or third parties operating the ad serving technology may use device or similar information that is collected through cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, or similar technologies to customize ads and to perform analytics concerning your use of the Fortinet Websites and other websites tracked by these third parties. These technologies also may control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. To the extent any of this information is collected by third parties, you acknowledge and agree that such collection and use is governed by those third parties’ privacy policies and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such third parties. Cookies may be associated with de-identified data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider in hashed, non-human readable form.
For more information about tailored ads and your choices to prevent some of these third parties from delivering tailored ads, you may visit the following third party websites: the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Page.  You can also visit the Google Ad Settings page adjust your preferences regarding certain ads facilitated by Google. Please note that you will still receive ads even if you opt out of tailored ads. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored to your interests. If your browser is configured to reject cookies when you visit an opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your opt-out may no longer be effective. Also, the opt-out services identified above are controlled by those third parties, not Fortinet, and Fortinet does not control which companies choose to participate in those programs.
Do Not Track. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Services for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the various advertising opt outs above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.
