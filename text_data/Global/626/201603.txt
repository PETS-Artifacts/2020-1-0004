Personal Information

	BookBrowse.com does not collect any personal information on you unless you provide it. E.g. if you signup for our free newsletter or become a member we will store your email address and other basic contact information (first name for the free newsletter and name and mailing address for the membership list).  
	
We use a third-party email host for maiings, so the name and email address of those on our mailing lists are also securely stored at our email host, Constant Contact. 
	
	Email addresses collected when people enter BookBrowse giveaways, quizzes or take part in surveys are used only to select the winning names and are deleted within a few weeks of the winners having claimed their prizes.
	
	We make every effort to protect BookBrowse from malicious attack - but if we were hacked, members' credit card information would not be compromised because we do not store any financial information on BookBrowse at all (it is passed directly to our payment processor, Paypal). 
	
    Publishers usually mail the books that people win in book giveaways, or are assigned to read for First Impressions or the Book Club. When we send a mailing list to the publisher to fulfil it is with clear instructions that the list is to be used only to mail the specific book to the specific people listed, and under no circumstance is to be stored for future use.  
    
We have never and will never sell, give-away or rent our mailing list.
    The only time we would ever do so would be with your express permission or if ordered by a court of law.

Tell-A-Friend

	Visitors sometimes wish to tell a friend about a particular page at BookBrowse, or send themselves a reminder.  For this reason, like many other websites, BookBrowse provides a convenient 'tell-a-friend' tool that allows you to send a personal message to a friend telling them about BookBrowse.  
	
	Email addresses are used only to send this one-time message, and are not stored or recorded by BookBrowse in anyway.
	
	
"My Reading List"

Members have the option of creating and storing book lists on BookBrowse - for example books they have read and want to read. Members can also record their personal thoughts on these books. At this time, member reading lists can only be viewed by the individual member when that member is logged in. They are not available to the general public to view at all. Members have requested that BookBrowse provide the ability for lists to be made public - either so that the member can provide access to specific people or so that their lists are freely available to all internet users. If BookBrowse were to do this in the future, the default setting would be that a list remains private unless an individual member specifically opts to make his or her list(s) public. 
	
Information Automatically Logged

	We collect IP (internet protocol) addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site.  IP addresses are also used to gather broad demographic information such as the percentage of visitors by country. 
	
	Because IP addresses are usually shared by many people, BookBrowse (like the majority of websites) uses a 'cookie' in order to know how many individuals come to the site.  When you visit us, BookBrowse's server sends a tiny file (cookie) to your computer containing a sequence of letter & numbers. This is stored on your hard disk in a special folder for cookies.  
	
	If you visit BookBrowse again, your computer will check its files to see if a cookie matches, and if so send this little file back to BookBrowse, so that you are recognized as a returning visitor.  This helps us calculate how many people visit in total and when they visit, but it does not give us any personal information about you at all.  
	This is what the contents of a typical BookBrowse cookie file looks like:

	If you're interested in knowing more about cookies we recommend this site.
