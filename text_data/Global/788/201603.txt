Any information gathered when you use MoneySmart website or
MoneySmart apps will not be disclosed or distributed further
without your consent.
We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles in
the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) which
regulates the collection, storage, quality, use and disclosure of
personal information.  We also follow the Federal Government
website guidelines issued by the Office of the Australian
Privacy Commissioner.
MoneySmart is run by the Australian Securities and Investments
Commission (ASIC).  Please refer to ASIC's privacy policy for
information about how ASIC handles personal information, your
rights to seek access to and correct personal information and how
to complain about breaches of your privacy by ASIC.
Collection of statistical
information
ASIC (or the service provider used by ASIC) only logs visits to
MoneySmart for statistical purposes. The visitor information that
is logged includes:

The server address
The top level domain name e.g. .com or .gov etc
The date and time of the visit
The pages accessed and documents downloaded
The previous site visited
The type of browser used

ASIC may also collect information for research purposes, but
without any identifying factors.
For example, MoneySmart may include your visit to its
superannuation calculator in preparing aggregate statistical
information such as '20% of the people who used MoneySmart's
superannuation calculator explored making extra contributions to
their superannuation'.
Other than for statistical purposes no attempt will be made to
identify your visit or browsing activities except in the unlikely
event of an investigation.  In an investigation, a law
enforcement agency may inspect the internet service provider's log
files with a warrant.
Collection, use and
disclosure of personal information
MoneySmart will only retain personal information with your
consent, via a prominent button that you may choose to click.
 Any time this occurs, you will be informed of the purpose for
which the information is being collected.
MoneySmart will not disclose or distribute your personal
information without your consent, except where required to by law,
for example by court order.
When you set up a personal profile in MoneySmart (so that you
can save and retrieve your results for calculators and apps), or
when you request subscription to our e-newsletter, MoneySmart will
only require you to supply your email address.  All other
details you might choose to supply are optional.
Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which
you provided it and will not be given to any outside party.
You can amend all the information in your MoneySmart personal
profile.
Publishing unclaimed
money data
Unclaimed money records are published on the MoneySmart website
so people can find their lost money.  ASIC offers a free
service that people would otherwise be charged for by commercial
money finding businesses. ASIC is required or authorised by law to
publish this information.
Cookies
This website may use cookies (small pieces of information
exchanged between your web browser and a website server) for online
surveys.
Internet security
risks

against data breaches, including firewalls, security patches,
regular security testing and data encryption.  This website
complies with the Australian Government Protective Security Policy
Framework and Information Security Manual.
