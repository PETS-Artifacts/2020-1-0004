Any information gathered when you use ASIC's MoneySmart website
or apps will not be disclosed or distributed further without your
consent.
We comply with the Australian Privacy Principles in
the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) which
regulates the collection, storage, quality, use and disclosure of
personal information.  We also follow the Federal Government
website guidelines issued by the Office of
the Australian Information Commissioner.
The MoneySmart website is run by the Australian Securities and
Investments Commission (ASIC).  Please refer to ASIC's privacy policy for

rights to seek access to and correct personal information and how
to complain about breaches of your privacy by ASIC.
Collection of statistical
information
ASIC's MoneySmart website collects information, without
identifying factors, for statistical and research purposes, and to
help improve our tools. This information can include: 

The user's server address
The top level domain name e.g. .com or .gov etc
The date and time of the visit
The pages accessed and documents downloaded
Responses to questions
Items added to lists
The previous site visited
The type of browser used

For example, we may include your visit to our superannuation
calculator in preparing aggregate statistical information such as
'20% of the people who used ASIC's MoneySmart superannuation
calculator explored making extra contributions to their
superannuation'.
Other than for statistical purposes no attempt will be made to
identify your visit or browsing activities except in the unlikely
event of an investigation.  In an investigation, a law
enforcement agency may inspect the internet service provider's log
files with a warrant.
Collection, use and
disclosure of personal information
ASIC's MoneySmart will only retain your personal information
with your consent, via a prominent button that you may choose to
click.  Any time this occurs, you will be informed of the
purpose for which the information is being collected.
ASIC's MoneySmart will not disclose or distribute your personal
information without your consent, except where required to by law,
for example by court order.
When you set up a personal profile in ASIC's MoneySmart (so that
you can save and retrieve your results for calculators and apps),
or when you request subscription to our eNewsletter, you will only
be required to supply your email address. All other details you
might choose to supply are optional.
Your email address will only be used for the purpose for which
you provided it and will not be given to any outside party.
You can amend all the information in your MoneySmart personal
profile.
Publishing unclaimed
money data
Unclaimed money records are published on ASIC's MoneySmart
website so people can find their lost money.  ASIC offers a
free service that people would otherwise be charged for by
commercial money finding businesses. ASIC is required or authorised
by law to publish this information.
Cookies
This website may use cookies (small pieces of information
exchanged between your web browser and a website server) for online
surveys.

to protect against data breaches, including firewalls, security
patches, regular security testing and data encryption.  This
