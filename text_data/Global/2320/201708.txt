If you prefer to limit sharing information such as your driving record, claim history with other companies, and credit information, call your State Farm agent or 800-865-6035. Please note, your choice:

If you are an existing customer and have already told us your customer information sharing preference, no action is needed unless you want to change your preference.
Residents of Vermont: State Farm will not share certain customer information across our State Farm family of companies unless authorized by you. This does not limit State Farm from sharing information about your transactions with us (such as your payment history) or your experience with us (such as your claim history) as permitted by law.
