We also ask subscribers for additional, optional, information, which is not required to participate in the e-mail service. The purpose of gathering this optional information is twofold: 1) with a greater understanding of our users we can develop an e-mail service even better suited to the needs of our subscribers and 2) to generate a statistical profile of all subscribers that is shared with advertisers on The Weather Network.When a subscriber cancels his or her subscription account, that individual's personal information (name and e-mail address) will be deleted from our database within 30 days.Facebook CommentingWhen a user chooses to log in to comment using their Facebook account, we request access to the information indicated in the Facebook acceptance screen and described below.Users can click "Allow" to login using their Facebook account, or click "Don't Allow" to close and return to the login options.

Unless the user has "opted in" elsewhere on the website, we will not send the user marketing or promotional material."Post to Facebook as me: The Weather Network may post status messages, notes, photos, and videos on my behalf"We require this access to allow users to send comments made on our website to their own Facebook pages, allowing them to share links with their friends.
