Legal Notice
OpenSignal Inc. respects your privacy. This policy explains the privacy practices of OpenSignal Inc. ("OpenSignal") on www.opensignal.com (the "Website") and with respect to OpenSignal's mobile application (the "Application") (collectively referred to as "the Services"). It describes how OpenSignal collects and uses your personal information and the rights and options available to you.
This policy is incorporated in OpenSignal’s Terms of Service (the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms").
By surfing, logging or connecting to, accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between the Company and any person connecting to, accessing or using OpenSignal. 
In this policy, the term 'personal information' (or 'personally identifiable information') means any information that, with reasonable efforts, may be used to identify you, such as a first and last name, home address and email address.
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE
When you register with the Services, OpenSignal may ask you to provide certain contact and personal details, such as mobile device number and e-mail address. Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out dated information may impair OpenSignal's ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you when necessary. 
Further information may be collected when OpenSignal exchange communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact OpenSignal's support team, or report a violation to the abuse team.
PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE
The Services are based on users' locations and submissions, including user submissions made to third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Service upon such users' choice, all of which may include personal information. You may upload and share content, such as Speed Tests, with other users on social media. The content that you share over social media should be treated as neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.
