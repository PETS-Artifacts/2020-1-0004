What is “Personal Information?” 
“Personal Information” is information that can be associated with a specific user and used to identify that person,
                for example, full name (first and last); a home or other physical address including street name and city
                or town; phone number; or online contact information such as an email address or screen name. Personal Information
                may be willingly submitted by you in your interaction with the Services. OverDrive does not collect or access
                any Personal Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive. Other information, that is not Personal
                Information, may be collected automatically by visiting and/or using our Services.
Do I need to provide Personal Information to OverDrive in order to use the Services? 
No, you can use most Services without providing any Personal Information to OverDrive. An OverDrive account is
                not required to use most Services. A valid library card is all you need to use most Services.
If you choose to create an OverDrive account, you will be required to submit Personal Information to OverDrive.

                to us is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure.
                We encrypt the transmission of sensitive data we collect from visitors of our Services using secure sockets
                layer (SSL) technology. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and physical access

                library card number and/or Adobe® ID, Internet Protocol addresses, device types, and unique device
                data such as device identifiers and operating systems. Again, OverDrive does not collect or access any Personal
                Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive.
Some Services provide the ability for you to see your digital content selections/lending history. If you are
                using your institution’s OverDrive-hosted website, Libby or the OverDrive app, you will have the option to show your lending history in the app.
                You can hide your lending history by following the instructions within the app or help articles. Your lending history is private
                and protected as confidential. We do not share it with any third parties, except (i) to persons acting within
                the scope of their duties in the administration of your library, or (ii) if compelled to disclose it pursuant
                to a process, subpoena, or court order after a showing of good cause by the law enforcement agency or person
                seeking the records and authorized pursuant to a federal, state, or local law relating to civil, criminal,
                administrative or legislative investigative power.

                email address for any other purposes than the specified use. OverDrive will not send you any communications
                without your consent. Information about users of school Services is only retained by OverDrive for the time
                period necessary to support the authorized school or educational purposes. 
OverDrive may use and share non-personally identifiable information, such as general demographic or location
                information, or information about the computer or device from which you access the Services. Additionally,
                we may anonymize Personal Information and share it in an aggregated form with third parties

What happens when I visit an external website not related to OverDrive’s Services? 
Our Services may include links to non-OverDrive websites, outside the control of OverDrive. If you click these
                links, you will leave OverDrive and enter websites that may have different privacy policies than OverDrive.
                OverDrive is not responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites. These linked
                websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you
                read carefully.
Is my information transmitted to other countries? 
Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily
                involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using the Services, you acknowledge
                and consent to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country where we
                have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to, payment processors, cloud service
                or other Information Technology providers, and other companies that provide services to us). You understand
                that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection
                as in your country.
What if I contact OverDrive for a support issue? 
If you contact OverDrive directly for assistance resolving an issue with the Services, it may be necessary for
                OverDrive to use support tools to resolve your issue. For a limited number of issues, these tools may provide
                OverDrive support personnel with visibility of your borrowing information while your support case is being
                resolved.

What is OverDrive's Get a Library Card Service?
OverDrive’s Get a Library Card online service (“GLC”) helps users obtain access to the library’s OverDrive digital collection.
                Only authorized patrons of the library are permitted to access and checkout digital content from the library’s digital collection.
You must be at least 13 years old to use GLC.  If you use GLC, you will be asked to submit your name and mobile phone number to OverDrive.
                Only U.S. mobile phone numbers are eligible for use with GLC.  The information you submit will be used to confirm your mobile phone number
                is associated with you and to verify that you have an address in your library’s service area.
                Libraries that participate in GLC provide OverDrive with the zip codes that comprise their service area.
                Submitting your name and mobile phone number to GLC confirms your consent to this Privacy Policy and OverDrive’s
                Terms and Conditions.
To verify that your address is in your library’s service area, OverDrive will share your name and mobile phone number with a third-party verification service,
                Cognito.
                Cognito will use your name and mobile phone number to return an address, if any, to OverDrive. To aid the
                verification process and increase the likelihood that an address is found, you may be asked to submit your date of birth.
                Your date of birth will be shared with Cognito.
Cognito does not use your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth for marketing or sales purposes,
                nor do they share your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.
OverDrive will send a text message to the mobile phone number you provide (standard text message rates apply)
                to verify the mobile phone number’s association with you.
If you are validated as having a residential address within your library’s service area, you will be able to access and
                checkout digital content from your library’s OverDrive digital collection for twelve (12) months from the date you are validated.
                Your name, mobile phone number, and address are stored by OverDrive for the purpose of authenticating your checkouts
                from the library’s OverDrive digital collection. Your date of birth, if submitted to OverDrive, is not stored by OverDrive.
                Unless otherwise permitted through your opt-in consent to receive marketing communications,
                OverDrive does not use your name, mobile phone number, or date of birth for marketing or sales purposes, nor do we share your name,
                mobile phone number, or date of birth with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.
In addition to obtaining checkout privileges to your library’s digital collection,
                you may also be eligible for a library card for access to your library’s additional resources (e.g. physical book and media borrowing).
                Through the validation process, OverDrive will store your address for the purpose of providing your name, address,
                and mobile phone number to your library, where you may be eligible for a library card for access to additional library resources.
                Your use of GLC confirms your consent to OverDrive providing your name, address, and mobile phone number with your library,
                and confirms your consent to be contacted by your library, if necessary.
If you have questions or concerns regarding GLC, please contact OverDrive via email at privacy@overdrive.com.
