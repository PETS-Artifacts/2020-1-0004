You  may provide us with information, including personally identifiable information  when you use the IOC Digital Properties, for instance to communicate with us,  create a user account, complete certain transactions or subscribe to a  newsletter or other services.
If you want to create a user account, we ask  you to provide us with your name, email address, country of residence, login  information, and password.

We may implement automatic tracking processes  (cookies) gathering information (such as browser type, operating systems, IP  address and the date and time of access) on the IOC Digital Properties to help  improve their content, customise them based on users’ preferences and conduct  research on traffic and audience. Cookies may also be used to store user names  and passwords so that users don’t have to log in at each session. You may block  cookies by changing your browser settings.
Publicly  available information 
IOC Digital Properties may aggregate certain  publicly available information (e.g. texts, photos and videos) sourced from publicly  accessible accounts opened by third parties on third party social media  services such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Any person whose social media  content is displayed on IOC Digital Media Properties may contact the IOC at privacy@olympic.org,  in order to have such content removed from the IOC Digital Properties.

From time to time, we  may offer you the possibility to receive communications (including  communications related to products and services) from selected third parties  such as our commercial partners and members of the Olympic Movement. If you  agree to receive such communications, we may share your information with the  relevant third parties, while leaving you the possibility to opt-out at any  time.     
We reserve the right  to disclose personal information we hold about you if we are required to do so  under applicable laws or pursuant to any judicial or administrative process,  and to the extent necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding  unlawful activities, or violation of our Terms of Service.
HOW  DO WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
