The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:
i. Personal information you provide to us

More generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, or user music preference data, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Songkick only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally.

Again, Songkick never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Songkick if your computer supports this type of program.
