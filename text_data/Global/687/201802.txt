We may share and pass your Personal Information (including details of your purchasing preferences) with or to our holding companies, subsidiaries or associated companies in which we have an interest including, without limitation, any of our joint venture organisations (together, our “associated companies”).  For a list of our associated companies, please contact our Data Protection Officer whose contact details are listed below.
When you submit Personal Information to Arsenal Jobs (www.arsenal.team.careers), this will be used solely in connection with your registration to the site or your application for a particular role and will not be shared with third parties other than those engaged by us in connection with the recruitment process, such as recruitment consultants or agencies.
We will not send you any unsolicited marketing. Where you have provided us with your consent, we may send you emails or other marketing messages with information and offers relating to Arsenal, as well as information and offers which we may send you on behalf of our commercial partners (“Partners”) (a list of which can be found at www.arsenal.com/the-club/sponsors-partners).  
We will never share your Information with our Partners for them to send marketing messages directly to you, however we may share this Information with them so that they can tell us how to market to you on their behalf in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information.  In all cases, we will take care to ensure that these organisations only process your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, your preferences and the law.
If you no longer wish the Information you provide to us to be shared with our Partners in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, or you wish to update your marketing choices in other ways, please follow the procedure set out in Section 9.
As indicated in Section 2, we may also combine your Information with other information that we obtain from our dealings with you or which we receive from other organisations. For example, we may engage reputable third parties to analyse your Information and supplement it with demographic and other statistical information which those third parties hold. By understanding more about you, we can then communicate with you in the most appropriate way and with the most relevant information.  
In the event of the sale of the business or the integration of the business with another party, we may disclose your Personal Information to advisers or prospective purchasers’ advisers. We may also disclose your Personal Information to third party organisations for the following purposes:
·        to process and deliver orders which you have placed with us;
·        for credit control and debt collection;
·        to maintain our systems;
·        to comply with any legal obligations or a court order; or
·        to enforce or apply our terms and conditions and other agreements, or to protect our rights or property or those of our customers or others, including for fraud protection or credit risk reduction purposes.
Your Personal Information is password-protected to prevent unauthorised access to it. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone.
6. Use of your Information outside the European Union
Some of the organisations (including, without limitation, our associated companies and Partners) to which we may disclose your Information are situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your Information to these countries some of which do not have laws that protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom. If we do transfer your Information to other territories, we will endeavour to ensure that your Information is properly protected.
7. Policy for Children
We realise and understand that many children will visit the Websites, use the Apps, or interact with Arsenal via another route, but encourage all persons under 13 to consult with their parents or legal guardian before submitting any content or information to Arsenal. Parents or legal guardians should, in particular, supervise children when online and recommend that parental control tools be put in place. Although anyone known to be under the age of 13 may participate in competitions and promotions, notification of a win or prize will be sent directly to the parent or legal guardian identified in the initial registration process. Any publication of a competition winner’s personal details for visitors known to be under 18 will require parental or legal guardian consent during registration.
8. Changes to this Privacy Policy
We aim to meet high standards and our policies and procedures are, therefore, constantly under review. From time to time we may change our security and privacy policies. Accordingly we recommend that you check this page periodically, or request a copy of the current Privacy Policy from our Data Protection Officer, in order to keep up to date.

We would encourage you to update your Personal Information promptly if it changes.
