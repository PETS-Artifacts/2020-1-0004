Below is information regarding AppleInsider\'s commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.\n\nUser Information\n\nDuring your visit to the site, AppleInsider does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you beyond what you specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account through the AppleInsider discussion forums or article comment system. However, even then, AppleInsider does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages.\n\nAppleInsider does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, usually changes periodically depending of your type of Internet connection). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to statistically evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties or available to anybody outside of the AppleInsider staff.\n\n\nCookies\n\nAlong with countless other Web sites, AppleInsider uses cookies to enhance your experience.

Other user settings such as preferred site display options are also managed by cookies.\n\nCookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by AppleInsider staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without AppleInsider\'s knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.\n\nIf you would like to opt-out of Non Personally Identifiable Information (PII) cookie tracking, please visit the NAI opt-out page here: \n\nThird-party Ad Server\n\nA portion of the advertisements displayed on the AppleInsider Network are served by third-party advertisement providers, including Advertising.com, TribalFusion, Google, and Federated Media.
