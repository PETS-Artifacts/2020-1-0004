Introduction
This is the Online Privacy Policy of Xerox Corporation in the United States.
This privacy policy covers the websites belonging to Xerox Corporation (“Xerox” or “we”) in the United States. It does not cover the websites of Xerox subsidiaries or affiliates who publish their own policies.
At Xerox, privacy on the Internet means that:

Xerox reserves the right to notify you about administrative matters that pertain to your Xerox products or services. We may disclose your personally identifiable information, as required by law or regulation, in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; or if Xerox reasonably believes it is necessary to protect Xerox, our customers, or the public. Although we do not currently anticipate a change in our corporate status, in the event of a merger or acquisition of the company or a substantial portion of its assets, Xerox may disclose, transfer or sell personal information collected online to the surviving or acquiring party, respectively.
