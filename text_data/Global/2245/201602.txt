This Privacy Policy Statement informs you of terms and procedures for the collection, processing and use of your personal data by Ankama Games, registered under the business identifier 492 360 730 in the Lille Métropole trade and corporate register, and by its parent company and affiliates (jointly and indifferently called the "Company", "Ankama" or "We" ("Us")). This Charter also informs you of your data-protection rights and obligations when using the Ankama websites (the “Websites”), video games (the “Games”) and applications (the “Applications”) edited by the Company available on computers or mobile devices and that will provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

The Websites, Games and Applications are collectively designated by the term “Services”.

Ankama Games is responsible for collecting personal data, which are accessible to all the companies in the Ankama group.

By accessing or using the Services, you acknowledge that you are conversant with the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement and you consent to them.
 

Article no. 2 : Collection and use of personal data
The term "personal data" denotes any and all informing directly or indirectly identifying you, by reference to an identification number or to one or more elements specific to you.

When you use our Services, you may be asked to supply certain personal information, or such information may be processed, particular for the following reasons, without limitation implied:
 

the creation, management and monitoring of an Ankama account;
the purchase of products and services;
the management and tracking of orders, payments and subscriptions;
participation in competitive games;
replies to surveys;
the use of forums;
event marketing and commercial canvassing;
contacting Support;
user-satisfaction surveys and complaints handling;
customer loyalty initiatives, sponsoring and canvassing;
processing the IP address to identify the place of residence and for the security of the account;
subscription to certain newsletters and features;
inclusion in an e-mailing list;
preventing and detecting unusual or unlawful behaviour, particularly as regards bank card payments;
combating fraud;
supervision and monitoring of player behaviour and of compliance with the behaviour rules, possibly to the extent of closing the Ankama account;
analysing customer activity on the Services;
securing access to customer spaces;
managing job offers and applications.

For these purposes, you may be requested to provide certain personal information, particularly your name, postal address, e-mail address, user names and passwords, age, date of birth, telephone numbers and sex. You will be informed, when the data are collected, whether the data we are asking you to disclose are required or optional.

We will not ask you for this information if you are only visiting our Websites, but you will not be allowed to access certain areas of those Websites, such as the forums, unless you register.

The Company may offer you the chance to connect to certain Services by means of a social network or game platform identifier. This connection method will sometimes be required to access certain functionalities of the Services, notably to offer you the chance to interact with other users of these networks and platforms.

By connecting via a social network or a game platform, you will be asked to accept that certain data concerning you is shared with Ankama. By accepting this sharing of information, Ankama shall have access to this data and will keep some of it.

Thus, by connecting to some of our Applications via the social network Facebook, Ankama will have access to your list of friends but will not keep it. This access allows us to let you benefit from certain functionalities of the social network involving other users. We keep your Facebook identifier to allow us to recognise you on several mobile devices and to re-attribute to you the progress acquired during your prior connections.

When you authorise our Services to interact with social networks or game platforms, we can share data concerning you with your contacts. This data includes your name, profile photo on the social network concerned and your progress and/or ranking in our games.

These social networks and game platforms are created and managed by third parties and are not controlled by Us. We invite you to refer to their conditions of use and their privacy policies to understand how these third parties process your data and those they are likely to communicate to us.
 

Article no. 3 : Disclosure of personal data
Ankama may use third party service providers to collect your personal data on Ankama's behalf, for the purpose of performing the tasks required to execute your orders, deliver products, process your payments and combat fraud. Ankama may also, for the same purposes, be required to disclose to those service providers some of your data, particularly personal data, using a secure channel.

The personal details you sent us may be shared with other Ankama subsidiaries in countries outside the European Union, particularly Brazil and Singapore.

Ankama may also share your personal details with third party service providers situated outside the European Union, particularly Canada and the USA.

These details are sent to recipients outside the European Union to build good customer relationships. Ankama has taken every necessary precaution to ensure that your personal details are sufficiently protected either under contractual clauses established by the European Commission, or because these transfers are carried out for an American company which complies with the Safe Harbor principles.
