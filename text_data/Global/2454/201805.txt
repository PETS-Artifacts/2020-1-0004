This Privacy Policy and the ESRB Privacy Certified certification seals shown on our websites (“Websites”) confirm that ESA is a member in good standing of ESRB’s Privacy Certified Program.  To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative and all of our Websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection and use practices. As a licensee of this privacy program, we are subject to frequent audits of our Websites and other enforcement and accountability mechanisms administered independently by the ESRB.

1. What information does this Privacy Policy cover?

This Privacy Policy applies to the use and sharing of personal information collected on and after the date that this Privacy Policy is posted.

2. What types of personally identifiable information do we collect about our guests?
We don’t require personal information to access our Websites.  However, if you prefer not to disclose personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Websites.  Personal information is information that identifies you and may be used to contact you.  To offer our guests certain features on our Websites, we may collect several types of personally identifiable information.
Information You Provide to Us
All of the personal information we receive comes directly from our guests.  We may collect personal information from our guests to:

Participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions
Report piracy, offer feedback, or other business inquiries
Sign up to receive newsletters (such as ESA Tools and Updates)
Receive customer or technical support

This information may include:

Name
E-mail Address
Mailing Address
Telephone Number
Photo

Please note that, if you donate to our fundraising campaign, we collect the amount of your contribution, occupation and address (whichever address you provide), in addition to your name. This information is then sent to our vendor, Democracy Engine, for processing purposes. ESA does not collect any of your financial information. We encourage you to review Democracy Engine’s privacy policy at http://www.democracyengine.com/subscriber_privacy_policy.
Additionally, if you have access to our Policy Arcade website, please note that if you upload a document, the name and e-mail address you provide will be visible to other users who are logged into the website.
Children
We don’t knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.  We take kids’ privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience at all times. If parents believe that we have unintentionally collected their child’s personal information, they should contact us at privacy@theESA.com to request the deletion of the information.
Information Collected Through Technology
We collect information through technology to make our Websites more interesting and useful to you.  For example, when you come to one of our Websites, we collect your IP address.  An IP address often is associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company or your university.  At times, we use IP addresses to collect information regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our Websites.  We do not combine your IP address with any other personally identifiable information.
Cookies
Our Websites also use cookies.  Cookies are pieces of information that a Website sends to your computer while you are viewing the Website. We and other companies use cookies for a variety of purposes.  For example, when you return to one of our Websites after logging in, cookies provide information to the Website so that the Website will remember who you are.  You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies.  You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.  Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies.  If you turn cookies off, you won’t have access to many features that make your web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of our services may not function properly.

3. How is your personally identifiable information used and shared?
We don’t share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties without your consent.  Besides technical information required for the support of our internal operations (i.e., IP address), we don’t require disclosure of personal information to access most of our Websites.  If you prefer not to disclose any personal information, you may not be able to enjoy certain features of our Websites.
We will only collect information to the extent reasonably necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives.
ESA Tools and Updates
Information collected from those who voluntarily submit it to us is used to provide services like updates on special events, game news and e-mail announcements of interest to our users. We do not share your personally identifiable information with third party marketers.
Operational Uses
We may also use the personal information you provide to us for other “Operational Uses.”  For example, we may use your information to send you administrative communications either about your account with us or about features of our Websites, including any future changes to this Privacy Policy.
Please note that, through our Website at www.areweinyourstate.org, we use your mailing address for the purpose of compiling and providing users with statistics relative to their congressional district. You have the option of determining whether or not your name, city and state are displayed in our feed of video game industry advocates. You may also optionally upload a photo to be displayed with your name and generate a support banner that can be shared on your social media profile. We will never share your full mailing address with other users or with third parties outside of the scope of this Privacy Policy.
Third Parties
We occasionally use third parties (other companies, agents or contractors) to perform services necessary to our operations.  For example, we have partnered with other companies to personalize our Websites, analyze customers’ interaction with our Websites, assist with fundraising, send newsletters and process consumer surveys.  We also may provide postal addresses to the U.S. Post Office for delivery purposes.  In the course of providing such services, these private, third party companies may have contact with your personally identifiable information and have agreed to securely store and maintain the personal information received from us and only use your personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Business Information
For practical reasons, we treat personal information submitted to us in a business capacity different from information we receive in a non-business capacity.  Personal information submitted to us in a business capacity (e.g., resumes, event sponsorship) may be shared with third parties, depending on the nature of the inquiry.
Purchase or Sale of Businesses
From time to time, we may purchase a business or sell one or more of our businesses and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the purchase or sale.  If we purchase a business, the personally identifiable information received with that business would be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, if it is practicable and permissible to do so.  If we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy).  The provisions of this paragraph also will apply if we are sold as part of bankruptcy proceedings.
Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Web sites and Others
We will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce our terms of use; enforce contests, sweepstakes, promotions, and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or protect the safety and security of our Web sites or third parties.

4. What choices do you have about the collection, use, and sharing of your personally identifiable information?
As mentioned above, you have control over the personal information you submit to us.  If at any time you decide to remove your personal information from our database, you may do so by e-mailing us at privacy@theESA.com.
You may opt-out of receiving our newsletters at any time by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the newsletter email or by reaching out to us using our contact information provided later in this Privacy Policy.

5. What kinds of security measures do we take to safeguard your personally identifiable information?
The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us.  We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, improper use, loss or alteration.  We use industry standard practices such as encrypted communications, physically secured rooms, firewalls and password-protection systems to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information.  We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted personal information by e-mail or by posting a notice on the affected Web site.  We also strive to limit access to personal information to employees performing a legitimate business function.  We periodically review our security procedures to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods.  However, please understand that, despite our best efforts, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable.

We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time.  If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you provided us, or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Websites covered by this Privacy Policy.  Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective 30 days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or 30 days following our posting of notice of the changes on the Websites covered by this Privacy Policy.
