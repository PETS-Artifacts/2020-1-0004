CSIS may track IP addresses (the Internet address of a computer) to keep track of a user's session, while the user's personal information remains totally anonymous. Tracking IP addresses can give us important information about our visitors. For example, we can learn which parts of the Site users are visiting and how long they stay. When CSIS receives information about you or about your session, we may use it for research or to improve the Site and the services we offer you.
