NetApp Commitment to Data Privacy Protection  

NetApp is committed to compliance with all applicable country-specific data privacy laws. Protecting the privacy and security of your Personal Data is of the highest importance to NetApp; therefore, we conduct our business by abiding by applicable laws on data privacy and data security.
This Privacy Policy tells you about NetApp’s policies and practices for the collection, use, processing, storage, transfer, and disclosure of information that we may collect about you through our sites and services, including, but not limited to the Web site or subdomains of www.netapp.com, (e.g. our Communities site, Training site, and Support site). Before using our sites and services, you will be asked to provide your authorization and consent, agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and consenting to the processing of information about you as described here and in compliance with relevant data protection laws. The collection, use, storage, transfer and disclosure of your Personal Data will be strictly limited to the terms for which you provide your authorization. For the purpose of this policy, the reference to Personal Data includes the term “personally identifiable information.”
NetApp is committed to compliance with all relevant country-specific data privacy laws, including approval and adoption of our Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) within the European Union. NetApp’s global data privacy compliance program also consists of the implementation of unambiguous authorizations and consents, EU Standard Contractual Clauses, model contracts/transfer agreements, privacy principles, privacy statements, privacy policies, and country-specific registrations and filings. This privacy policy covers the Web site www.netapp.com, and all other applicable NetApp Sites
Personal data 

Through our Web sites, NetApp will not collect any Personal Data about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address), unless you voluntarily choose to provide us with it (e.g. by registration, survey, contest participation), provide your explicit consent, or unless otherwise permitted by applicable laws and regulations for the protection of your Personal Data.
Purpose of Use 

When you do voluntarily provide us with Personal Data, we will use it to respond to your inquiry, process your orders, register you for an event, provide information related to NetApp products, services and events, manage your Community, Support and/or NOW accounts, offer you the opportunity to participate in surveys and contests, register for NetApp training courses, or provide you access to additional information or offers. Also, to support our customer relationship with you:

we may store and process Personal Data and share it with our worldwide affiliates to better understand your business needs and how we can improve our products and services; or
we (or a third party on our behalf) may use Personal Data to contact you about a NetApp offer in support of your business needs or to conduct online surveys to understand better our customers' needs.

If you choose not to have your Personal Data used to support our customer relationship (especially direct marketing or market research), we will respect your choice. We do not sell or otherwise market your Personal Data to third parties, except to NetApp affiliates.
Information That We Collect and Use 

We collect personal information from you when you register with NetApp. Examples of personal information are name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, company name, position and any other contact details you willingly provide to us. For a complete list of all data elements that we collect and the use of those data elements, contact us at privacy@netapp.com.
We collect Personal Data about those who communicate with us such as e-mail address, user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and site registrations. This information is used to personalize our communications with you about products that are specific to your needs and interests. Rather than burden you with information that is not relevant or of interest to you, we try to target information that is specifically important to you. No Personal Data is collected, used, accessed, stored, transferred or distributed without your explicit authorization. At any time, even after you have given authorization, you can opt out of receiving these communications by contacting us at privacy@netapp.com or by clicking on our “Unsubscribe” link.
We use the information that we collect to improve the content of our Web pages by incorporating information that is relevant to our clients, to notify customers about updates to our Web site, to contact customers for marketing and sales purposes (including notifications related to product enhancements, warranties, and renewals) that are related specifically to their needs and interests, to track applicants for career opportunities, and to communicate with our partners. This information is not shared with other organizations for any reason, commercial or business, without your prior explicit consent.
If you browse and/or apply for jobs in the Careers portion of our Web site, your application and any additional information that you provide may be used to assess your skills and interests against career opportunities at NetApp, and for reporting purposes as may be required by U.S. law or country-specific laws. This usage is covered in the initial authorization that you provide to NetApp. When you access our Applicant Tracking System, you are asked to provide your authorization for us to collect, use, process, store, transfer and distribute your Personal Data before you enter any Personal Data. We use your information to communicate with you and to inform you of career opportunities.
NetApp does use third-party entities to provide valuable services on our behalf. To provide these services to you, we need your explicit consent to share your Personal Data with them. Third parties with which we share your information are bound by all relevant data privacy laws, terms of confidentiality, NetApp’s BCRs, and this Privacy Policy. All of our approved third party providers go through an extensive data protection compliance vetting process before being selected as a third party provider. For a complete list of these third parties and the services they provide, contact us at privacy@netapp.com.
NetApp supplements the data it collects with additional data received from third-party sources, by using data append services or data brokers. The additional supplemental data consists of contact, company, and industry data, as well as title, department, address, phone number, and updated e-mail addresses. When using the information provider through these services, we will contact you via email to obtain either your explicit opt-in to continue marketing to you, or your explicit opt-out to remove you from our contact database, depending on the applicable data privacy regulation. For additional information about supplemental data and the third-party sources, contact us at privacy@netapp.com.
The company does not share, sell, rent, or trade Personal Data with third parties for their promotional purposes or for any purposes without your explicit consent. If you do not want to receive e-mails from us in the future, go to the NetApp subscription center to unsubscribe or to update your subscription preferences: www.netapp.com/us/forms/sp-update.aspx, or you may contact privacy@netapp.com. NetApp follows the country-specific requirements to implement the opt-out within the legally allowed time period.
NetApp also offers a partial opt-out option. This option allows you to choose the data elements you want to provide and those you do not. For more information about opting out of providing certain data elements, contact us at privacy@netapp.com.

If you use communities, blogs, or chat rooms on NetApp Web sites, you should be aware that any Personal Data you submit there can be read, collected, and used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. NetApp is not responsible for the Personal Data that you choose to submit in these forums, unless it was released by NetApp without your consent.
For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name, but not the e-mail address.
Purpose Limitation 

NetApp will collect, use or disclose Personal Data supplied by you online only for the purposes disclosed to you, unless the disclosure:

is a use of the Personal Data for any additional purpose that is directly related to the original purpose for which the Personal Data was collected
is necessary to prepare, negotiate and perform a contract with you
is required by law or the competent governmental or judicial authorities
is necessary to establish or preserve a legal claim or defense
is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities, such as willful attacks on NetApp information technology systems.

Communications or Utilization Data 

Through your use of telecommunications services to access our Web site, your communications data (e.g. Internet protocol address) or utilization data (e.g. information on the beginning, end and extent of each access, and information on the telecommunications services you accessed) are technically generated and could conceivably relate to Personal Data. To the extent that there is a compelling necessity, the collection, processing and use of your communications or utilization data will occur and will be performed in accordance with the applicable data privacy protection legal framework.
Non-Personal Data Collected Automatically 

When you access our Web sites, we may automatically (i.e., not by registration) collect non-Personal Data (e.g. type of Internet browser and operating system used, domain name of the Web site from which you came, number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed). We may use this data and share it with our worldwide affiliates to monitor the relevancy of our Web sites and improve their performance or content.
"Cookies" - Information Stored Automatically on Your Computer 

Propensity management is the management of an individual’s inclination or natural tendency toward certain interests, products, needs, and so on. In order to tailor our communications with you to make sure that we are addressing your specific needs and not overwhelming you with unwanted information, we use cookies to handle propensity management. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your Web browser. When you revisit www.netapp.com, our server recognizes the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you can still use most of the features of our Web site, including ordering items.
This privacy statement covers the use of propensity management by this site only and does not cover the use of propensity management by any advertisers. We work with companies, such as Adobe, that use third-party cookies and Web beacons to collect anonymous information that helps us measure and improve our content and advertising effectiveness. Adobe collects and analyzes anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our users. This data is collected only in aggregate form.
NetApp complies with all global regulations regarding the use of cookies, including the EU Cookie Directive. Visitors to our site are asked to provide their consent before we place any cookies on your device. For detailed information regarding NetApp’s use of cookies, please refer to the NetApp Cookie Policy.
Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs) 

We employ a software technology called clear gifs (also known as Web beacons or Web bugs) along with other technologies such as e-tags, and javascript that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies that are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs, which are about the size of a period, are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs, e-tags, or javascripts to our customers’ personally identifiable information. For detailed information regarding NetApp’s use of Clear Gifs and other technologies, please refer to the NetApp Cookie Policy.
Children 

NetApp will not knowingly collect Personal Data from children without insisting that they seek prior parental consent if required by applicable law. We will only use or disclose Personal Data about a child to the extent permitted by law, to seek parental consent pursuant to local law and regulations or to protect a child. The definition of "child" or "children" should take into account applicable laws as well as national and regional cultural customs.
Security 

To protect your Personal Data against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss or alteration and against unauthorized disclosure or access, NetApp uses technical and organizational security measures.
Links to Other Web Sites 

NetApp Web sites contain links to other Web sites. NetApp is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other Web sites.
Data Security Breaches 

To protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access and use, or accidental loss and destruction, NetApp has implemented strict security controls and intrusion detection software to notify us in the case of any potential or actual invasion of our systems. We have implemented a Data Breach Notification Policy and Remediation Plan and have established an Incident Response Team that has been trained to react immediately to any unauthorized access of our databases and systems. Should any data security breach occur that negatively impacts your Personal Data, you will be notified as soon as possible once the breach has been determined.
Right to Be Forgotten 

NetApp is committed to taking all reasonable steps necessary to ensure that any data you request to be forgotten and can be erased with existing technology will be done so. However, any data you post to our sites that you agree to make available to third parties or for which you make public, is outside the boundaries of which NetApp can erase. NetApp will do everything technically possible to erase your data if you feel it is being held for longer than needed or if you withdraw your consent to receive information from us and request the right to be forgotten. However, NetApp will not be able to erase your data if:

it is technically impossible;
for legal reasons (if mandated by local law);

Do Not Track 

NetApp may receive data lists containing your contact details from third parties. In countries, states or regions where Do Not Track laws are in place, NetApp will take every reasonable action to validate the lists we have received with the Do Not Track lists available through government agencies before communicating with you. NetApp abides by all Do Not Track regulations.
Questions and Comments 

NetApp will respond to reasonable requests to review your Personal Data and to correct, amend or delete any inaccuracies. If you have any questions or comments about the NetApp Global Data Privacy Policy (e.g. to review and update your Personal Data), please send us your questions and feedback.
