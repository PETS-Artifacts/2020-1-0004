When you register with us, you may need to complete certain fields (some are required and some are optional), as well as choose a user name and password. In these situations, if you choose to withhold any personal information requested by us, it may not be possible for you to gain access to certain services or parts of a specific Web site.If you do provide personal information when signing up for a service or completing a survey, UCAR will process such information for specific and limited purposes which we inform you about when we ask you for information.  For example, we may collect and use personal data to provide you with services, to respond to a question, or to communicate with you for other purposes.  Except as described in Section 3 hereof, unless expressly described in an applicable privacy policy, UCAR will not distribute your information to third parties.2.  General Use Information. UCAR receives and stores certain types of information whenever you interact with the Web site. For example, UCAR maintains Web activity log files such as the number of pages requested, time spent on a page, and result sets from search queries.

From time to time, UCAR may also share user information with its sponsors, auditors and consultants.  Additionally, UCAR reserves the right to share user information with any entity that is an affiliate or successor in interest to UCAR or UCAR’s management of NCAR.4.  Cookies.
