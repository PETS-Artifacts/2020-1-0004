How We May Use and Disclose Information We Collect About You
 
The information we collect via our website may be used and disclosed to improve the content of ADA.org and advance the ADA’s mission. For example, the ADA may use this information for purposes such as:

Registering you for, or providing you with, programs and services you have requested


Processing, fulfilling and following up on your orders or membership application


Providing access to publications


Responding to your emails or online requests


Sending you information you request


Sending and processing surveys and continuing education quizzes


Publishing membership directories and registration lists


Sharing with companies to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you 


Sharing your email address with companies to deliver communications on our behalf


Sharing your email address as described below

Sharing information about you with service providers 


Sharing with third parties as required by law


Sharing demographic information for research purposes

For each visitor to our website, where reasonably possible, our web server automatically recognizes only the user’s internet protocol (IP) address, but not the email address. Our system can recognize the identity of individuals who sign in using their usernames and passwords.

We collect information such as the internet protocol (IP) address of visitors to our website, aggregate information on what pages users access or visit, user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, and information volunteered by users, including from surveys, purchases and/or registrations. We also may collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email.

With respect to cookies: We use cookies for a number of purposes, including to administer our website and to record session information, such as items that users add to their shopping carts and user-specific information on what pages users access or visit. 

Advertising on ADA.org may be served through a vendor that uses IP addresses for purposes such as controlling ad frequency.

The ADA, its subsidiary and affiliates may use or disclose your contact information and other information about you, such as your occupation, specialty, member status, graduation date and dental school, to alert you to new information, products and services, events and other opportunities. From time to time, we may also make your contact information and other information about you available to other organizations we believe to be reputable, such as companies whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you register on ADA.org to attend an event, the ADA may provide an attendee list to other attendees and to entities that collaborate with the ADA on the event.

With respect to your email address: We generally do not knowingly disclose your e-mail address without your express or implied consent.  We may disclose your e-mail address if you serve in a leadership capacity or if you provide your e-mail address in connection with an event or an attendee list. We have instituted opt-out capabilities to help you avoid receiving unwanted commercial email messages from the ADA. We will not knowingly give or sell your email address to any unrelated entity outside the ADA, its service providers, subsidiaries and affiliated entities, ADA members, and state and local dental societies. 

The ADA maintains directories of dentists that may include information you submit via our website. These directories are shared with ADA members and state and local dental societies. A directory containing information about ADA members is publicly accessible on MouthHealthy.org; members may elect to provide additional information, such as email address and photo, through the expanded profile option. 

The ADA may provide delegates’ names and mailing addresses in response to a request from a dental specialty organization. The Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA) publishes delegates’ names, districts, cities and states, as well as information, including ADA.org email addresses, about officers and trustees. 

The ADA may share or license information about you to a third party if, in our sole discretion, we believe that it is  (1) reasonably necessary to perform a service or deliver a product or publication; (2) authorized by you or as set forth in any applicable agreement (whether express or implied) between you and ADA, or with your consent; (3) permitted under this Privacy Notice; (4) required by statute or regulation; (5) of interest to dentists, dental students, members of the dental team, or consumers of dental services, or (6) in the good-faith belief that such action is appropriate for reasons of security or legal compliance.

If you participate in an activity such as attending or speaking at a program or authoring a publication, information such as your name and photo may be shared via ADA.org or ADA publications.

The ADA also occasionally hires other companies to provide services on our behalf, including, but not limited to, hosting of online resources, processing credit card transactions, packaging, order fulfillment, answering customer questions about products or services, consulting services, data modeling, printing, sending postal mail and processing membership and event registration. We will provide those companies with information they need to deliver the service. Third parties may collect information such as your IP address that may indicate your online activities over time or across different websites when you use our websites. At this time, this website does not respond to do-not-track signals.
If you use the ADA Credentialing Service the ADA transfers certain information about you into the ADA Credentialing Service, and you enter certain other information into the ADA Credentialing Service. The payors, hospitals and employers that you designate can access the information about you in the ADA Credentialing Service and can use it from time to time for credentials verification. The ADA and its service providers can access the information about you in the ADA Credentialing Service and can use it from time to time to make the service available. Security measures that include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings are in place to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and use. If information about you is disposed of, it will done securely.
