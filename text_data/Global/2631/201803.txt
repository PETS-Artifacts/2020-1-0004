Privacy Policy

We built Eventfinda to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around  you. We understand you may not want to share personal details; that is why we   give you control of your information. Registration requires you to choose a   username, home region and email address. Your email address is never displayed   to anyone on the site. Your email address may be dislayed in emails if you use   Eventfinda to connect with other people, like when sending friend invites.   Other personal details will only be displayed if you fill them in - the nature   of social networking websites means your details will be visible to others -   but only the details you choose to supply. Should you want your details removed completely from the Eventfinda Network   there is a simple 'cancel my account' feature in your profile settings on any   web site in the Eventfinda Network.
