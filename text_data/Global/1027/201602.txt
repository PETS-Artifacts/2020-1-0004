Privacy Policy - current as at 29 July 2015
We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (Privacy Act). We are also bound by Division 3 of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act, which regulates the handling of credit information, credit eligibility information and related information by credit providers.  This Privacy Policy outlines how we deal with your personal information (including credit-related information), as well as our legal obligations and rights as to that information. If we agree with you to use or disclose any of your personal information in ways, which differ to those stated in this Privacy Policy, the provisions of that agreement will prevail.  1. Key types of information  Certain words have special meanings when used in this Privacy Policy. These are shown below.  "Personal information" means information or an opinion about an individual who is identified, or who can reasonably be identified, from the information. Although we try to make sure that all information we hold is accurate, "personal information" also includes any inaccurate information about the individual.  "Credit eligibility information" means information that has been obtained from a credit reporting body, or that has been derived from that information, that is about an individual's credit worthiness.  "Credit information" means personal information that includes the following:  information about an individual, like their name and address, that we may use to identify that individual information about an individual's current or terminated consumer credit accounts and, from 12 March 2014, an individual's repayment history the type and amount of credit applied for in any previous consumer or commercial credit applications to any credit provider, where that credit provider has requested information information about an individual from a credit reporting body information about consumer credit payments overdue for at least 60 days and for which collection action has started advice that payments that were previously notified to a credit reporting body as overdue are no longer overdue information about new credit arrangements an individual may have made with a credit provider, in relation to consumer credit currently or previously held, to deal with any defaults or serious credit infringements by that individual information about court judgments which relate to credit that an individual has obtained or applied for information about an individual on the National Personal Insolvency Index publicly available information about an individual's credit worthiness, and an opinion of a credit provider that an individual has committed a serious credit infringement of credit provided by that credit provider.  We may not hold all of these kinds of information about a particular individual. However, if we hold any of these kinds of information, it is protected as "credit information" under this Privacy Policy.  "Credit-related information" means credit information, credit eligibility information and related information.  2. Collection  We will only collect personal information (including credit information) directly from you, unless you have provided your consent. This information will generally come from what you provide in your application for one of our products or services and supporting documentation.  We only ask for personal information relevant to our business relationship with a customer. When you first apply to become a customer, or apply for one of our products or services, we may request:  identifying information, like your name, address and other contact details and your date of birth information about your financial position, like your income, expenses, savings and assets and any (other) credit arrangements your employment details your tax file number, and your reasons for applying for a product or service.  We may also need to collect personal information (including credit-related information) about you from third parties. For example, when assessing an application for credit from you we may collect personal information from your employer, other credit providers and third party service providers including credit reporting bodies. Credit reporting bodies collect credit information about individuals which they provide as credit reports to credit providers and others in the credit industry to assist them in managing credit risk, collecting debts and other activities. From 12 March 2014, you can also ask a credit reporting body, through contact details on their website, not to use or disclose your personal information if you believe on reasonable grounds that you have been or are likely to be a victim of fraud, including identity fraud.   Some information is created through our internal processes, like credit eligibility scoring information.   3. Use   We may use your personal information (including credit-related information) for the purpose of providing products and services to you and managing our business. This may vary depending on which products and services you have applied for and which member of the Beyond Bank Group of companies you are dealing with. This may include:  assessing and processing your application for the products and services we offer executing your instructions ongoing servicing of our relationship with you charging and billing uses required or authorised by law protecting you and us from error or fraud research and development collecting overdue payments due under our credit products managing our rights and obligations regarding external payment systems, or direct marketing.   We do not use or disclose your personal information (including credit-related information) for a purpose other than:  a purpose set out in this Privacy Policy a purpose you would reasonably expect a purpose required or permitted by law, or a purpose otherwise disclosed to you to which you have consented.  4. Disclosure  We may disclose your personal information (including credit-related information) to other organisations that provide services that assist us in supplying or administering the products and services we offer.   Organisations we will usually disclose your personal information to include:  our related companies external organisations that are our assignees, agents or contractors external service providers to us, such as those we use to verify your identity payment systems operators our computer bureau (Data Acton Pty Ltd) printing and mailing houses fraud prevention service providers, and research consultants our professional advisors, such as accountants, lawyers and auditors your representative, for example, lawyer, mortgage broker, financial advisor or attorney, as authorised by you.

However, we will not sell any of your personal information to any other organisation. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that these organisations are bound by sufficient confidentiality and privacy obligations with respect to the protection of your personal information.   Disclosure outside of Australia: We may disclose your personal information overseas where you choose to make an international transfer. The countries we may disclose your personal information to are those to which you make a transfer. However, if we do disclose this information outside Australia, we will do so on the basis that the information will be used only for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. From time to time we may use service providers or other third parties who operate or hold data oustide of Australia, which may result in your personal information being stored overseas. These parties are selected specifically to assist in enabling us to provide products or services to you, in particular information technology solutions. At present our arrangements include providers based in the United States of America. Where this occurs we will ensure that appropriate data handling and security arrangements are in place to protect your data.  5.

Sensitive information includes information about an individual's health, and membership of a professional or trade association.  Unless we are required or permitted by law to collect that information, we will obtain your consent. However, if the information relates directly to your ability to meet financial obligations that you owe to us, you are treated as having consented to its collection.  6. Refusal of credit applications  We may refuse an application for consumer credit made by you individually or with other applicants. Our refusal may be based on credit eligibility information obtained from a credit reporting body about you, another applicant or another person proposed as guarantor. In that case, we will give you written notice that the application has been refused on the basis of that information. We will tell you the name and contact details of the relevant credit reporting body and other relevant information.  7. Security  We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information (including credit-related information), held on our website or otherwise, is protected from:  misuse, interference and loss, and unauthorised access, disclosure or modification.   We ask you to keep your passwords and personal identification numbers safe, in accordance with our suggestions.

From 12 March 2014, the credit reporting body cannot use information about your existing loans or repayment history in carrying out its pre-screening and it must destroy its pre-screening assessment once it has given us, or a contractor acting on our behalf, the list of eligible recipients. From 12 March 2014, if you do not want your credit information used for pre-screening by a credit reporting body that holds credit information about you, you can opt-out by informing that credit reporting body. The credit reporting body we use is Veda Advantage, whose contact details are available on their website (www.veda.com.au).  12.
