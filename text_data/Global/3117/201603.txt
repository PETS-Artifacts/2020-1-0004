Uptime Robot (a service by Buzpark Bilisim Tarim Urunleri Sanayi Tic. Ltd. Sti.) operates several websites including uptimerobot.com, api.uptimerobot.com and blog.uptimerobot.com. It is Uptime Robot's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.
Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Uptime Robot collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Uptime Robot's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Uptime Robot's visitors use its website. From time to time, Uptime Robot may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Uptime Robot also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for users. Uptime Robot only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Uptime Robot's websites choose to interact with Uptime Robot in ways that require Uptime Robot to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Uptime Robot gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at Uptimerobot.com to provide name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Uptime Robot -by purchasing access to the premium service, for example- are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. Transaction data, including personal data, can be transferred to PayLane Sp. z o.o. located in Gdansk at Arkonska 6/A3, zip code: 80-387, KRS: 0000227278, 2Checkout.com Inc. and PayPal Pte. Ltd. (PayPal.com), in order to process payments. In each case, Uptime Robot collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Uptime Robot. Uptime Robot does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
Aggregated Statistics
Uptime Robot may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Uptime Robot may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Uptime Robot does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information
Uptime Robot discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Uptime Robot's behalf or to provide services available at Uptime Robot's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Uptime Robot's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Uptime Robot will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Uptime Robot discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Uptime Robot believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Uptime Robot, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Uptime Robot website and have supplied your email address, Uptime Robot may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Uptime Robot and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Uptime Robot takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
