The Information We Collect
When you access official UF Health web sites, certain access information described below is automatically collected. No other information is collected through our official web sites except when you deliberately send it to us (for example, by completing and sending an online form or by clicking a link to send us an e-mail).
Access Information (automatically collected)
Client information: the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer youâ€™re using.
Technical information: identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access, the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our web site, and the "cookie information" used to direct and tailor information based on your entry path to the site.
Essential and nonessential technical information lets us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan Web site improvements. To expedite this process, some official UF Health web sites use "cookies." Usually a cookie enables us to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the site. We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web sites. For example, we may determine that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out a particular registration form. But we do not disclose information that could identify those specific individuals.
