SRI manages marketing communication preferences, including newsletters and e-mail, via opt-in consent.  You can opt-out from receiving future e-mail marketing communications by clicking here or by clicking the opt-out link at the bottom of marketing communications.  Data retention of e-mail addresses collected for marketing purposes is based on recency of the last open or click-through.  Recipients who have not opened or clicked-through an e-mail from SRI within 18 months will be removed from our database.
SRI may also collect the following information through user-submitted inquiries and lead forms on our Sites: name, job title, company/institution, country, e-mail address and phone number.  SRI may use this information to respond to user-submitted inquiries or to keep the individual informed on relevant industry updates.  For individuals residing in the European Union, SRI requires opt-in consent before sending marketing communications.  An individual may opt-out from receiving marketing communications from SRI at any time by clicking here.
