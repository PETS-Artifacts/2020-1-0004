	Privacy Statement

	The American Mathematical Society (AMS) is committed to protecting the privacy of its members and customers.

	Personal Information

	The AMS may collect personally identifiable information such as name, postal address, telephone number, e-mail address, institution affiliation, credit card number, checking account number, or date of birth through various activities of the Society. This personal information is collected and used by AMS staff for the purpose of facilitating a relationship or business transaction.

	The AMS website resides behind a firewall and uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, the industry-standard security protocol used to communicate with browsers) to transmit personal information. Data is strongly encrypted during transmission to ensure that personal and payment information is secure. Industry-standard data encryption techniques are used to protect personal information on AMS computers. SSL-capable browsers typically have a symbol on the browser window to indicate when they are in a secure mode. In addition, the URL will begin with "https:" for all browsers.

E-mail
	The AMS does not sell or rent e-mail addresses to other organizations. Certain e-mail addresses may be published in both print and electronic AMS publications including the AMS website. The AMS may generate e-mail for the following types of communication:


		Notification e-mail to which the individual may subscribe and unsubscribe.

		Transactional e-mail, which is the result of a business transaction initiated with the AMS.

		Relationship e-mail, which is sent as an informational service because of a relationship with the AMS.

		Commercial e-mail, which is sent to promote an AMS product or service (You may opt not to receive this type of e-mail).

		Correspondence from AMS staff as a result of a communication initiated by a member or customer.


	E-mail that has a provision for opt-out will include instructions on how to do so. All inquiries regarding subscription-based e-mails should be directed to the AMS Sales, Marketing and Member Services Department (see AMS Contact Information below).

Mailing Lists
	Postal mailing list's, comprised of full name and postal address, may be sold to other organizations (e.g. professional societies and/or commercial publishers) for one-time promotional or informational use. Promotional or informational materials are subject to AMS approval prior to the rental. E-mail addresses are not included in mailing lists.

	The AMS may occasionally send informational or promotional materials to members and customers. You may choose to exclude yourself from all, none, or only non-AMS mailings by contacting the Sales, Marketing and Member Services Department (see AMS Contact Information).

Third-party Agents 
	The AMS uses third-party agents for several business purposes, including credit card validation, hotel registration, and shipping. These agents are permitted to use your personal information only to provide the AMS with a specific service and not for any other purpose. Please contact the AMS Sales, Marketing and Member Services Department (see AMS Contact Information) if you believe this policy has been violated.

	The AMS makes every effort to preserve your privacy, but we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. The AMS may also disclose personal information if it believes in good faith that such action is necessary.

	Non-personal Information

	Non-personal information is collected behind the scenes by the AMS web server and is used to compile general website usage statistics or facilitate access to restricted website services. Such information includes:


		IP address of computer

		Browser-related information

		Locations visited on the website

		HTTP cookies


IP address
	IP address is used to verify access rights of licensed subscribers to AMS products that require license agreements, such as AMS Electronic Journals and MathSciNet. They also aid in the general administration of the website.

HTTP Cookies
	A HTTP Cookie is a piece of data that is stored by your browser in either your computer's memory or on your computer's hard drive. The AMS uses cookies to keep track of user session identity on the website, such as tracking items in a bookstore shopping cart or maintaining access to restricted website services via the AMS Web Account. Cookies are also used to track the effectiveness of various services provided on the AMS website. Browsers generally allow you to disable cookies. Services on the AMS website that require a login to an AMS web account require that cookies are enabled.

Public Forums
	Several public forums are hosted on the AMS website. The inherent public nature of these forums dictates that the AMS assumes no responsibility for protecting the information disclosed on them by users. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in public forums.
