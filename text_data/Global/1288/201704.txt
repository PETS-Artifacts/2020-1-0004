Wir garantieren, dass die zu Recht beanstandeten Passagen unverzüglich entfernt werden, ohne dass von Ihrer Seite die Einschaltung eines Rechtsbeistandes erforderlich ist.

Alle innerhalb des Internetangebotes genannten und ggf. durch Dritte geschützten Marken- und Warenzeichen unterliegen uneingeschränkt den Bestimmungen des jeweils gültigen Kennzeichenrechts und den Besitzrechten der jeweiligen eingetragenen Eigentümer. Allein aufgrund der bloßen Nennung ist nicht der Schluss zu ziehen, dass Markenzeichen nicht durch Rechte Dritter geschützt sind! Das Copyright für veröffentlichte, von EurekaMag.com selbst erstellte Objekte bleibt allein bei EurekaMag.com. Eine Vervielfältigung oder Verwendung solcher Dateien, Grafiken, Tondokumente, Videosequenzen und Texte in anderen elektronischen oder gedruckten Publikationen ist ohne ausdrückliche Zustimmung von EurekaMag.com nicht gestattet.

Verweise und Links: Bei direkten oder indirekten Verweisen auf fremde Webseiten ("Hyperlinks"), die außerhalb des Verantwortungsbereiches von EurekaMag.com liegen, würde eine Haftungsverpflichtung ausschließlich in dem Fall in Kraft treten, in dem EurekaMag.com von den Inhalten Kenntnis hat und es ihm technisch möglich und zumutbar wäre, die Nutzung im Falle rechtswidriger Inhalte zu verhindern. EurekaMag.com erklärt hiermit ausdrücklich, dass zum Zeitpunkt der Linksetzung keine illegalen Inhalte auf den zu verlinkenden Seiten erkennbar waren. Auf die aktuelle und zukünftige Gestaltung, die Inhalte oder die Urheberschaft der gelinkten/verknüpften Seiten hat EurekaMag.com keinerlei Einfluss. Deshalb distanziert er sich hiermit ausdrücklich von allen Inhalten aller gelinkten/verknüpften Seiten, die nach der Linksetzung verändert wurden. Diese Feststellung gilt für alle innerhalb des eigenen Internetangebotes gesetzten Links und Verweise sowie für Fremdeinträge in von EurekaMag.com eingerichteten Webseiten, Gästebüchern, Diskussionsforen und Mailinglisten. Für illegale, fehlerhafte oder unvollständige Inhalte und insbesondere für Schäden, die aus der Nutzung oder Nichtnutzung solcherart dargebotener Informationen entstehen, haftet allein der Anbieter der Seite, auf welche verwiesen wurde, nicht derjenige, der über Links auf die jeweilige Veröffentlichung lediglich verweist.

Cookies and Web Beacons: EurekaMag.com does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser. In short, EurekaMag.com collects (1) anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed, (2) Some 3rd parties like Facebook.com and Twitter.com may know you visited EurekaMag.com, if you use their services. While EurekaMag.com cannot control them, this knowledge presumably poses no threat to you. (3) EurekaMag.com is financed through online advertisments which use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on EurekaMag.com directly to your browser. (4) EurekaMag.com collects personal information if you explicitly request a PDF Full Text of an article on the site ("Request PDF Full Text").

(1) EurekaMag.com measures visitors using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within the site, how you arrived at the site and some basic information about your device. All of that information is anonymous – so EurekaMag.com does not know who you are; just that somebody visited the site. The information collected from analytics helps understanding what parts of the site are doing well, how users arrive at the site and so on. Like most websites, this information is used to make EurekaMag.com better. You can learn more about 
(2) Facebook, Twitter, AddThis and other social networks provide social buttons and similar features which EurekaMag.com uses on the site – such as the "Follow" and "Share" buttons. EurekaMag.com contains embedded code that these services provide and that the site does not control. These buttons work if you’re logged into their services. EurekaMag.com does not have any access to that information, and the site cannot control how those networks use it. Social networks therefore could know that you are viewing EurekaMag.com, if you use their services. As EurekaMag.com is remarkably inoffensive this might not be a concern for most users.	
	
(3)	Some of our advertising partners may use cookies and web beacons on our site. Our advertising partners include Google Adsense and Infolinks. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on EurekaMag.com directly to your browser. They automatically receive information including your IP address but excluding your name, address, email address, or telephone number when this occurs. Other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) may also be used by the third-party ad networks to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and/or to personalize the advertising content that you see. EurekaMag.com has no access to or control over these cookies that are used by third-party advertisers. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information on their practices as well as for instructions about how to opt-out of certain practices. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy. EurekaMag.com’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

(4) If you explicitly request a "PDF Full Text", EurekaMag.com records specific personal information about you, such as your name and email address. This is to inform you when the requested information, i.e, the PDF Full Text, is available on the site.

We may send you email notifications regarding the availability of a "PDF Full Text" which you have specifically requested.

In short, EurekaMag.com collects (1) anonymous statistics about your visit, like which of our pages you viewed, (2) Some 3rd parties like Facebook.com and Twitter.com may know you visited EurekaMag.com, if you use their services.

(4) EurekaMag.com collects personal information if you explicitly request a PDF Full Text of an article on the site ("Request PDF Full Text").(1) EurekaMag.com measures visitors using Google Analytics. This records what pages you view within the site, how you arrived at the site and some basic information about your device. All of that information is anonymous – so EurekaMag.com does not know who you are; just that somebody visited the site.

EurekaMag.com does not have any access to that information, and the site cannot control how those networks use it.
