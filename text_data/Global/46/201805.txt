Who we share your information with
When you use our website and services you are consenting to us
sharing your information for the following purposes:


Switching supplier online - if you place
an order with a supplier through our website we will share your
personal information with that supplier and they will collect
additional personal information from you.  Please note that
you will be entering a contract directly with that supplier and we
advise you to carefully read their privacy policy and their terms
and conditions.  We cannot be held responsible for the uses to
which a supplier puts your personal information once you have left
our website.



Switching suppliers by phone - if you
place an order with a supplier by phone we may use a telephone
service provided by a company called SimplifyDigital.  Your
personal information will be share with SimplifyDigital but may
only be used by the supplier you are placing an order with. 
SimplifyDigital will not share this information with any other
company or use it for any other purpose.  Please note that you
will be entering a contract directly with the supplier and we
advise you to carefully read their privacy policy and their terms
and conditions. 



Phone order tracking - we use a company
called Responsetap to help us track phone orders placed with
suppliers.  If you phone a supplier's call centre to place an
order, we will share your phone number with Responsetap solely to
monitor the progress of your order.  They will not share this
information with any other company or use it for any other
purpose.



Prize draws, competitions, special offers and
rewards - sometimes we use other companies to help us
manage prize draws and competitions and to fulfil special offers or
rewards.  In those circumstances, we will make this clear to
you and will provide a link to that company's privacy policy, which
we advise you to read.



Email communications - we use a company
called The Rocket Science Group to help us manage our email
communications.  If you provide us with your personal
information to send you additional information on other products
and special offers, we may share this information with The Rocket
Science Group solely to provide this service.  They will not
share this information with any other company or use it for any
other purpose.



Customer services - we use a company called
Zendesk to help us manage customer services enquiries.  If you
provide us with your personal information when making an enquiry,
we may share this information with Zendesk solely to provide this
service.  They will not share this information with any other
company or use it for any other purpose.


Other members of our group - we may share your personal
information with other companies within our group,
if you have given your consent for us to do so.  For example,
if you have bought a mobile phone or taken out a new mobile
contract then we may send you information on how to get money by
recycling your old handset or how to save money by buying a
refurbished handset.  Please read their privacy notices to
understand how they may use your personal information: Sellmymobile.com
and Comparemymobile.com.

We may use other companies to help provide or maintain different
parts of our website and service and in doing so they may process
your personal information.  This includes our postcode
checker; our speedtester; and our help desk and LiveChat
platform.  In these instances, we are the data controller and
the other companies must comply with our strict privacy
requirements.    
We link to other companies' websites from our website. We try to
only include quality, safe and relevant links but we cannot
guarantee or verify the content of any externally linked website.
If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that
they should have their own privacy policies and we have not
endorsed or approved those policies. We cannot be held responsible
(and do not accept any responsibility or liability) for the uses to
which any other company puts your personal information once you
have left our website. 
Where permitted by law, we may also disclose your personal
information:

if we sell the group or any company or part of the group;
to comply with any legal obligation, or to enforce or apply our
rights and other agreements; and
to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our group;
our customers, or others.

We may also exchange your personal information with other
companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection
and credit risk reduction.
Where we transfer your information
Some of the personal information we collect may be transferred
to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Union (EU).
It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EU who work
for us or for one of our suppliers.
Some of our services are provided by companies based in the
United States (for example, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud
Platform).  When your personal information is transferred to
the US we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that it is
treated securely and in accordance with this privacy notice and all
appropriate legal and regulatory requirements.  Many of the
companies we use are certified by the Privacy Shield
framework (which sets security and privacy requirements for
protection of your personal information) and we have written
agreements with them to ensure they cannot process your personal
information for any other purposes or share it with any other
companies without our express permission.
By submitting your personal information to us, you agree to this
transfer, storing or processing.
How we keep your information safe
Keeping your personal information secure is very important to
us.  Once we have received your personal information, we will
use strict procedures and security measures to protect it. 
Our website is certified secure by McAfee SECURE and we use a secure protocol (https://) to
encrypt your information between your computer's browser and our
website.  We protect our network with the latest firewall
technology and we securely store personal information and encrypt
it where necessary.  We restrict the number of our staff that
have access to any personal information and we have secure backup
systems to ensure that any personal information cannot be lost or
deleted.  We train all our staff so that they understand the
importance of keeping our customers' personal information
secure.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password
which enables you to access certain parts of our website, you are
responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not
to share a password with anyone and to choose a strong password
(which should contain a mixture of letters and numbers).
Please bear in mind that no information sent over the Internet
can be guaranteed to be totally secure. Although we will do our
best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the
security of any personal information that you send to our website
and it is sent at your own risk.
How to change your preferences
Our group will only send you emails or marketing communications
if you have agreed to this but you can ask us to stop at any
time.
If you no longer wish to be contacted by us, then you can let us
know by emailing our customer services team (customerservices@broadbandchoices.co.uk)
or by writing to us at the address below.
All group marketing emails have a clear unsubscribe link and if
you click it then we will automatically unsubscribe you and you
will not receive any further marketing emails.
In addition, all group marketing emails have a clear preferences
link and if you click it then you can update your marketing
preferences and your personal details.
How to get your information corrected or request we stop using
it
If you have any concerns about the accuracy of your personal
information then you can contact us in writing by post or email
(details below) and we will correct it.
If you want us to stop using your personal information then
please contact us in writing by post or email (details below)
explaining why you object to its use and what you want us to
do.  We will then respond appropriately to your request.
Please note that if you do not provide us with your personal
information or object to us using it then this may prevent us from
fulfilling certain requests (for example we cannot provide accurate
information on the broadband services where you live without your
postcode and we cannot help you with certain enquiries without your
contact details).
How to find out what information we hold
You have the right to get a copy of the information we hold
about you. This is known as a subject access request.
If you wish to make a subject access request then please contact
us in writing by post or email (details below).  You must
provide your full name, address and a contact telephone number.
If we hold information about you we will:

give you a description of it;
tell you the legal basis for us holding it;
tell you what we are using it for;
tell you who it could be disclosed to;
tell you how long we keep it; and
let you have a printed copy of the information or, if you
prefer, provide it to you in a commonly used electronic
format.

We will do this free of charge and we will respond to you within
one month or your request.
If you identify any inaccuracies in the information we send you
then we will correct it.
Changes to this privacy notice
We update our privacy notice from time to time so we suggest you
review it each time you provide any personal information.  Any
