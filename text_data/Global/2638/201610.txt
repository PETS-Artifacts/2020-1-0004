Oldways adheres to a permanent privacy policy that can be stated in clear English as follows: if you are a donor or if you give us your name, email address, or any other information about yourself — whether through this website or oﬄine — we will use it only for:
The purpose stated when you give it to us, such as signing up for one of our e-newsletters, or entering a contest, and 
Telling you about other nutrition activities and events in the future.
We will not trade, share or sell personal information to others, nor will we conduct donor mailings on behalf of other organizations. Our privacy policy includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following principles:
Personally identiﬁable information may only be obtained through lawful means.
The purposes for which personally identiﬁable data are collected shall be speciﬁed at or prior to the time of collection, and any subsequent use of the data shall be limited to and consistent with the fulﬁllment of those purposes previously speciﬁed.
Personal data will not be disclosed, made available, or otherwise used for a purpose other than those speciﬁed, except with the consent of the subject of the data, or as required by law or regulation.
Personal data collected shall be relevant to the purpose for which it is needed.
The general means by which personal data are protected against loss, unauthorized access, use, modiﬁcation, or disclosure shall be posted, unless the disclosure of those general means would compromise legitimate agency objectives or law enforcement purposes.
