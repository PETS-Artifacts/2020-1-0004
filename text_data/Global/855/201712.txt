Protect yourself when applying for jobs

There are thousands of genuine job vacancies posted every day on the jobactive website. However recently we have seen an increase in fake employers posting false job ads on the jobactive website. They may also email you directly through the Find Candidates feature of the website.
While we are vigilant in tracking down and removing false employers, it’s important for you to protect yourself. Here’s how:

Never give your bank or credit card details when applying for a job
Never provide your date of birth
Do not pay job application fees
Do not give out your Driver’s Licence or passport information
Check if the job is genuine (if possible) by researching the employer online or calling them before applying

If something doesn’t seem right, you can report fake job ads by:

using the ‘Report This Job facility’ available on all vacancies

        sending any relevant details to ajsfeedback@cc.employment.gov.au; or
    
calling the Job Seeker Hotline on 13 62 68

This Privacy Notice informs you of the collection of your personal information by the Department of Employment (the Department) in accordance with the department’s functions in connection with the delivery of employment services and ensuring compliance with participation and activity test requirements. It also informs you of how your personal information will be used and the circumstances in which it may be disclosed to another party.

    All personal information collected by the Department is protected by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (the Privacy Act). Employment Services Providers (the providers) contracted to the Department and the providers’ subcontractors are required to comply with the Privacy Act. For information about the Department’s personal information handling practices, please refer to the Department’s Complete Privacy Policy. This Privacy Notice contains three Parts as follows:


Part 1 – Job Seekers

How does the department collect your personal information?
Your personal information is collected from you when you register, provide or update your personal details on jobactive. It may also be collected from a third party, including Centrelink, your provider, or employers whom you have contacted via jobactive or whom you have submitted a job application to, if you have agreed or would reasonably expect your personal information to be collected in this way.
What personal information is the Department collecting?
The types of personal information collected by the Department may include your name, date of birth, Job Seeker ID, Centrelink reference number, telephone number, facsimile number, email address, information about your website, resumes (written, online video or online profile), cover letters, jobs you have applied for, job searches you have conducted, job vacancies that you have viewed and jobs you have been matched to on jobactive.
“Sensitive information” about you may also be collected, for example if you provide that information in your resumes (written, online video or online profile), cover letters or job applications on jobactive. Under the Privacy Act, “sensitive information” includes information about your health, criminal record, racial or ethnic origin, and membership of a trade union, or a political, professional or trade association.
Why does the Department collect your personal information?
The Department collects your personal information for the purposes of:

assisting you in finding employment
determining whether you are eligible to take part in services provided by a provider
ensuring you are paid correctly if you receive Government benefits
assisting you in complying with participation and activity test requirements
providing you with ready access to your job search related documents, and allow you to access your ‘My Job Search Effort’, and forwarding this information via email to a recipient of your choice. Please note that ‘My Job Search Effort’ functionality replaced ‘Application History’ from 6 December 2014
ensuring correct payments are made to providers for services they provide to you
evaluating and monitoring outcomes, programs and services delivered by providers
including you in surveys conducted by the Department and its providers
assisting in resolving complaints made by you or your provider
assisting in the administration of programs
assisting in providing and improving its services to both job seekers and employers.

By using jobactive, you consent to your personal information being collected, used and disclosed to third parties for the above purposes.
When you select a ‘Visible - Public’ privacy option, you also consent to your personal information being disclosed by providers to Employers for the purposes of assisting you find employment.
If the Department did not collect your personal information, the Department would not be able to provide you with some or all of jobactive services and make correct payments to you.
Who has access to your personal information?

Employers and Employer Brokers
providers

In limited circumstances, the Department may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties, including where:

the Department has reasonable grounds to believe that the disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to your life or that of another person
the disclosure is required or authorised by, or under law
the disclosure is for the enforcement of criminal law or of a law imposing a fine, or for the protection of the public revenue.

For the purposes of the Career Profile, if you select the ‘Visible – Public’ privacy setting, and choose to share your career profile with a third party, that third party will have access to all personal information contained in your career profile. In that situation, the recipient may not be bound by privacy law, and might share your personal information with other third parties without your consent or knowledge. Public access to your career profile can be revoked by changing your privacy setting back to ‘Visible – Registered Employer Only’ or ‘Private’. It should be noted if you select a ‘Visible’ privacy setting, your employment service provider may choose to share your career profile with an Employer via a public link.
jobactive users who have a Jobfit account can connect their two accounts together. The connection will involve entering their Jobfit email address and password on the jobactive website and submitting it for validation. To enable validation, the jobactive website will share any information required to do so (including your username, email address and password) with the Jobfit app.
Where validation is successful a connection is established which will allow for job applications submitted in jobactive or the job seeker's Job Seeker app to automatically transfer to their Jobfit account and award the user points, without them having to log the tasks in Jobfit separately. Job matching and job alerts set in jobactive will also be logged as an activity within Jobfit and award points to a user's Jobfit account, where they have established a connection between their accounts.

You should be aware that the jobactive website allows registered jobactive users to refer Vacancies to another person by email. Therefore, if a registered jobactive user elects to refer a Vacancy to you by entering your personal information (such as your name and email address) into a job vacancy referral form on the jobactive website, you will receive that referral. In these circumstances, the Department uses your personal information for the purpose of sending you that referral.
