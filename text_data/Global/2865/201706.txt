1.  What Personal Information About Customers Does UA Gather? 

The information we learn from you helps us personalize and continually improve your UA experience. Here are the types of information we gather:

Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on a UA Domain or give us in any other way. Click here to see examples of what we collect. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping experiences for you, improving our webstores, and communicating with you. 
Automatic Information: We also collect and analyze certain information when you interact with us that you may not intentionally give us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses a UA Domain or advertisements and other content served by or on behalf of UA on other websites.  Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 
Mobile: When you download or use software provided by UA, we may receive information about your location and your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. Most likely, these controls are located in the device's settings menu. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service provider or your device manufacturer. 
E-mail Communications: To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from UA, information on what items within the email you click, and information on any resulting web store purchase activities, if your computer and email software supports such capabilities. We also periodically compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences
Information from Other Sources: We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. Click here to see examples of the information we receive. 

2.  What About Cookies? 

Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to facilitate shopping on a UA Domain, enable personalized “remarketing” advertisements on other websites with content served by UA, and provide other functionality. 
The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the UA Domains’ essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use your myaudio account, add items to your Shopping Cart or proceed to Checkout. 

3.    Does UA Share the Information It Receives? 
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only in the situations set forth below and, in each such situation, only when the third party is subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice.

Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses sell offerings to you through a UA Domain. In other cases, we provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. Click here for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. 
Third-Party Service Providers: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, serving online advertising, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
Promotional Offers: Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of UA customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your Customer Communication Preferences.
Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other companies or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that UA, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will, of course, be one of the transferred assets. 
Protection of UA and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our website Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of UA, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice. 
With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

4. How Secure Is Information About Me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 
We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 
It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

5. What About Third-Party Advertisers and Links to Other Websites? 
Our site includes third-party advertising and links to other websites. For more information about third-party advertising at UA, including personalized or interest-based ads, please read our Interest-Based Ads policy. 

6.  Which Information Can I Access? 
UA gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with UA for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Click here to see some examples, the list of which will change as our website evolves. 

7.    What Choices Do I Have? 

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such UA features as myuaudio. 
You can add or update certain information on pages such as those referenced in the Which Information Can I Access? section. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 
If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your Customer Communications Preferences (If you do not want to receive Terms of Use and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Notice, those notices will still govern your use of the UA Domains, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes). 
If you do not want us to use personal information that we gather to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please adjust your advertising preferences via the appropriate third party advertising provider (such as Ad Roll or Google Ads. 
The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. Because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the UA Domains’ essential features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to use myaudio, add to your Shopping Cart or proceed to Checkout. 

8.    Are Children Allowed to Use the UA Domains?
If you are under 18, you may use the UA Domains only with the involvement of a parent or guardian. 

9. Does UA Participate in the Safe Harbor Program?
Until recently, the manner by which companies from the United States can transfer personal information about European Union citizens to countries outside of the European Union was regulated by the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the European Commission and relevant Swiss authorities.  But a recent decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union purports to invalidate the Safe Harbor, leading to some uncertainty in this area of the law.  We recommend that you visit the US Department of Commerce’s website for the most current information about the status of the Safe Harbor.  In the meantime, we will continue endeavor to resolve all complaints about privacy and the collection or use of customer information. If you have questions about our participation in the Safe Harbor program or have a complaint, please send an e-mail to kkoegler@uaudio.com.  

10. Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions 
If you choose to visit a UA Domain, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice and our website Terms of Use, including limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of the law of the State of California. If you have any concern about privacy at UA, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Notice and the Terms of Use will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

UA Website Terms of Use [3.b]

Interest-Based Ads [5.a]
On both UA Domains and unaffiliated sites, UA displays interest-based advertising using information you make available to us when you interact with our sites, content, or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our sites, visiting sites that contain UA content or ads, interacting with UA tools, In providing interest-based ads, we strive to follow the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).
Like other online ad networks, we use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively, “cookies”). Cookies enable us to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and other actions you take on our sites and other sites. This allows us to provide you with more useful and relevant ads. For example, if we know what ads you are shown, we can be careful not to show you the same ones repeatedly. We do not associate your interaction with unaffiliated sites with your identity in providing you with interest-based ads.
We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to third party sites that display our interest-based ads. However, advertisers and other third-parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the ad or content is directed towards (for example, users in the Pacific Northwest who bought or browsed for classical music). Also, some third-parties may provide us information about you (such as the sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that we may use to provide you more relevant and useful advertising.
Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that appear on our sites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Interest-Based Ads page. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices.

Which Information Can I Access? [6.a]
Examples of information you can access easily at UA Domains include up-to-date information regarding recent orders; personally identifiable information (including name, e-mail, password, communications and personalized advertising preferences); payment settings (including credit card information, billing address, and promotional certificate and gift card balances); e-mail notification settings; and you’re my.uaudio account.

UA offers you choices about receiving interest-based ads from us. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from UA. Please visit  the appropriate third party advertising provider (such as AdRoll, Facebook, or Google Adwords) to learn how to set this preference.
You can also generally opt-out of receiving personalized ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance’s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting the opt-out pages on the NAI website and DAA website.
