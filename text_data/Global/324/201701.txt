HT Media Ltd and our affiliated companies worldwide are
			committed to
			respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for
			appropriate protection and management of any personally
			identifiable
			information (personal information) you share with us
					
At HT Media Ltd we collect different types of information about
			our
			users for three main reasons: 
1. to help us to improve the services we offer 
2. to provide personalized services unique to individual users
				
3. to use anonymous details about our users to sell appropriate
			advertising space on the site. This might mean showing an
			advertiser
			how many users we have on the site; it does not mean sharing an
			individual's details with an advertiser. Where we collect
			registration information from an individual, we will never share
			that
			individual’s information with a third party, including an
			advertiser,
			without that user’s explicit permission.  
Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
Some of our Web pages utilize “cookies” and other tracking
			technologies. A “cookie” is a text file that may be used, for
			example, to collect information about Web site activity. Some
			cookies
			and other technologies may serve to recall Personal
			Information
			previously indicated by a Web user. Most browsers allow
			you to control
			cookies, including whether or not to accept them and
			how to remove
			them. 
You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie,
			or
			you may choose to block cookies with your browser, but please
			note
			that if you choose to block the cookies, you will need to
			re-enter
			your original user ID and password to gain access to

Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet
			domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser
			software and operating system types; click stream patterns; and
			dates
			and times that our site is accessed. Our use of cookies and
			other
			tracking technologies allow us to improve our Web site and
			your Web
			experience. We may also analyze information that does not
			contain
			personal information for trends and statistics. 
To protect your privacy, we have adopted the following
			principles:

Where HT Media Ltd collects personal information on the Web, we
			intend to post a purpose statement that explains why personal

			personal information outside of HT Media Ltd or those working on HT
			Media Ltd’s behalf. HT Media Ltd does not intend to transfer
			personal
			information without your consent to third parties who are
			not bound to

			legally required.
		
Choice
You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to
			HT

			this
			choice. If you choose not to provide the personal information
			we
			request, you can still visit most of HT Media Ltd’s Web sites,
			but you
			may be unable to access certain options, offers, and
			services that
			involve our interaction with you. 
If you chose to have a relationship with HT Media Ltd, such as a
			contractual or other business relationship or partnership, we will
			naturally continue to contact you in connection with that business
			relationship. 
Security
 Wherever your personal information may be held within HT Media
			Ltd

			from
			unauthorized access or disclosure. 
Third Party Services

			HT
			Media Ltd’s behalf. HT Media Ltd may provide information, including
			personal information that we collect on the Web to third-party

			means by which HT Media Ltd maintains its Web site and mailing
			lists.
			HT Media Ltd will take reasonable steps to ensure that these
			third-party service providers are obligated to protect personal
			information on HT Media Ltd’s behalf. 
HT Media Ltd does not intend to transfer personal information
			without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on
			HT
			Media Ltd’s behalf unless such transfer is legally required.
			Similarly, it is against HT Media Ltd’s policy to sell personal
			information collected online without consent.

			Use and to HT Media Ltd’s processing of personal information for
