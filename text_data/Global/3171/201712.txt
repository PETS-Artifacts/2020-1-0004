A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer or device until it expires or you delete it. You can always choose not to receive cookies by setting your browser's options to refuse to accept cookies. Amtrak, or any third parties on behalf of Amtrak, does not collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site. Accordingly, because Amtrak does not engage in the collection of such information, Amtrak does not respond to 'do not track' signals or other mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services. However, Amtrak uses cookies to collect certain technical or non-personal identifying information such as your IP address, operating system, browser software and other non-affiliated sites visited. See Sections 3 and 4 below for how we use this non-personal information, with whom we share it and why.
