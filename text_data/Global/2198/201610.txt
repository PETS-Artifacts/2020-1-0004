SYNONYM.COM'S SHARING OF INFORMATION.
                        Synonym.com shares information with third parties, but only
                        as described in this Section 4.

                        
Advertisers and Others. We share
                            non-personally identifiable information with advertisers,
                            service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct
                            business. Conversely, these advertisers, service
                            providers, and other persons may share with us non-PII
                            about you that they have independently developed or
                            acquired.
Service Third Parties. We contract with
                            affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide
                            services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include
                            providing marketing assistance, providing customer
                            services, sending Synonym.com email to you, removing
                            repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing
                            data. These third parties have access to personal
                            information needed to perform their functions.
Business Transfer. As we develop our business,
                            we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or
                            engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes
                            of control, or similar transactions. In such
                            transactions, customer information generally is one of
                            the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely
                            event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be
                            transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in
                            possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.
Affiliates. We may share user information with
                            our corporate affiliates. Some of our most significant
                            affiliates are identified on the website of our parent
                            company, Demand Media, Inc. (www.demandmedia.com).
                            Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control,
                            are controlled by us, or are under common control with us
                            and any joint venture in which any of the controlled
                            entities may participate from time to time. Any use of
                            your information by our corporate affiliates is subject
                            to this Policy or another policy no less protective of
                            your privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about
                            you from our corporate affiliates or from your visits to
                            other web sites that we or our corporate affiliates
                            control.

Compliance and Safety. We may release user
                                information when we believe release is appropriate
                                to:

                                    otherwise address written complaints of copyright
                                    infringement;
make disclosures under programs intended to
                                    prevent potential crimes or investigate
                                    persons;
enforce or apply agreements, including the
                                    Terms; or
protect the rights, property, or safety of
                                    Synonym.com, our users, or others, including
                                    exchanging information with other companies for
                                    fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

                            passwords in an email and you should assume that if you
                            get such a request, it might be fraudulent. YOU MUST
                            DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR
                            PERSONAL INFORMATION.
Our Security Measures. We have physical, electronic,
                            and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent
                            unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
                            correctly use your information. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT
                            GUARANTEE SECURITY. Neither people nor security systems
