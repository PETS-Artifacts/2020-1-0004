 Passively Collected Data Like most websites, we may automatically receive and record information in our server logs from your browser when you visit aclu.org. The information that we collect with these automated methods may include your IP address, cookie information, browser type, system type, and the referring URL. We use this type of information to measure and improve the performance of our site.  On occasion we also access this type of information to investigate or maintain the stability and security of our site. Voluntarily Submitted Data Certain pages on the ACLU site may invite you to share personally identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number.  Sharing that information will allow you to make a donation, join our email list, sign a petition, or participate in other similar online activities. We may use that voluntarily submitted data to:  Fulfill your orders or transactions. Contact you about other ACLU activities or news, or about opportunities to support the ACLU. In the case of petitions, display your first name, last initial, city, and state on petition forms that you sign. In the case of blog comments, post your comment and, if given, your name.  When We May Share Your Information With Other Organizations When we give you an opportunity to voluntarily submit information about yourself, we may give you the option of indicating that you permit us to share that data with other parties such as coalition partners or specific legislators. We will not share your data with such parties unless you have indicated that you permit us to do so. To help facilitate our membership growth, we may also use your name and mailing address in blind exchanges with other nonprofit organizations. Learn more about how this type of exchange helps our work, while limiting disclosure of your information: https://www.aclu.org/address-share. However, you may choose not to participate in this type of exchange by visiting our contact page and submitting a request to opt out. Our Email List If you sign up for our email list, we may collect data by using an embedded image to track whether you open our email and by using a URL that enables us to identify that you have taken an action, such as clicking a link in an email or signing an online petition. This allows us to build a more effective advocacy program, to inform you about the ACLU issues you care about most, and to make it simpler for you to sign petitions and fill out surveys.
