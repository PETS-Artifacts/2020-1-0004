Policy and Legal

The College operates under the terms and conditions outlined in its RVC Charter and RVC Statutes, and it remains compliant with statutory and financial regulations.  
The policy documents below are a transparent statement of our internal rules and regulations.  
The College complies with The Higher Education Code of Governance (Dec 2014), issued by the Committee of University Chairmen (CUC) in December 2014.  
Charitable Status
The College is a charitable body but is exempt from registration with and oversight by the Charity Commission under the terms of the Charities Act 2011 and therefore has no charity number. It is subject to the legal rules applicable to charities under English Law and to the general provisions of the Charities Acts. The College is treated as an exempt charity because it was created under Royal Charter and its principal statutory regulator, OfS, oversees its compliance with charity law.
The College is also the sole trustee of the Animal Care Trust, which is an independent charity that is fully registered with the Charity Commission.
Registered Name and Address
Legal name: The Royal Veterinary College .
Also known as: “Royal Veterinary College” and by the abbreviations “the RVC” or “RVC”, according to context.
