Any and all personally identifiable information you provide to AMTA through this Site is provided on a voluntary basis, and how much you disclose is up to you. The personally identifiable information collected on these pages may include, but is not limited to, name, title, organization, mailing address, email address, phone and fax numbers, and credit/debit card information. We also may collect information on your views and preferences as they relate to AMTA services.
In some cases, such as blogs or public forums, any personal information you provide may become publicly available to other members and possibly the general public. When you voluntarily disclose such personal information, that information may be collected and used by others, resulting in unsolicited messages from others.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, no confidential relationship is established when any user of this Site voluntarily provides comments, e-mail addresses, and/or other information to AMTA or posts the same in conference rooms, on profile pages, or in other interactive programs and features that may be developed and placed on-line from time to time. Such information is considered non-confidential, and AMTA is free to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use such information for any purposes whatsoever.
We also may record information about the computer you are using to connect to the Internet (IP address) and about your browser.

We also may use information you provide to conduct other business or to contact you about AMTA news, activities, membership, surveys, products, and services, and for other legitimate and lawful business purposes. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. However, AMTA expressly reserves the right to contact any member or other visitor regarding account status, renewals, or other matters relevant to subscription or service.
