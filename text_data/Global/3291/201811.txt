How We Collect, and Use Your Personal Information
Credit or debit card information and personal financial account information is considered “Sensitive Information.”  We do not directly collect credit card, debit card or personal financial account information when you subscribe to our content, because we use a third party vendor, Suntrust Merchant Services, via a third party fulfillment vendor to process our subscription billing. When you provide payment information to subscribe to our content you provide it directly to Suntrust Merchant Services and not to foreignpolicy.com. Suntrust Merchant Services is a third-party vendor and has its own privacy policy, which may be different from ours. This Privacy Policy does not cover Suntrust Merchant Services and foreignpolicy.com is not covered by Suntrust Merchant Services privacy policy. To learn about Suntrust Merchant Services privacy practices, please read their privacy policy at www.suntrustmerchantservices.com/privacy/
When you register for the Site or subscribe to our content, we collect your IP address for analytic purposes. If you have access to the Site through a business or employer account, we use your IP address to identify you with the account so you may access the Site.
We may receive information about you from publicly and commercially available sources, as permitted by law, which we may combine with other information we receive from or about you. For example, we may receive information about you from a social media site if you connect to our Site through that site.
Our collection of your personal information is limited to the collection of necessary and adequate information required to accomplish the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
When you provide personal information, it is being provided directly by you to us, unless we receive it from publicly available sources such as a social media site.
If we are involved in a reorganization, merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or sale of our assets, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you (for example, via a message to the email address associated with your account) of any such deal and outline your choices in that event.
Marketing Communications
You may receive marketing emails from us, only if you agree to do so.  Before sending any marketing communications we will make it clear to you during the registration or subscription process to check boxes or otherwise to “opt in” to receiving marketing emails and providing you the ability to change your preferences if you no longer want to receive them.  We also may email you occasionally with information or questions about your registration or your subscription account with reminders, warnings, or other types of requests.  We will collect and use individual user details if we have your permission or we have a legitimate interest for doing so, for example, collecting enough information to manage your subscription.
How do we Protect Your Personal Information?
We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your information when you enter, submit, or access your information online. We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures designed to protect your personal information against accidental or intentional destruction or loss, and unauthorized disclosure or access.

International Transfers of Personal Information
Please be aware that the personal information we collect may be transferred to and maintained on servers or databases located outside your state, province, country, or other jurisdiction, where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your location. If you are located outside of the United States, please be advised that we process and store personal data in the United States. Foreign Policy has executed standard contractual clauses to legitimize these data transfers.

In addition to collecting information directly from you, these third-party businesses may use tracking technology to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content, and track users who click on the links made available through the Site.

Accuracy of personal information
While we take various steps to ensure the accuracy and completeness of your personal information, we rely upon you to provide accurate and complete Information when interacting with us.
Your Rights in Connection with Your Personal Information
Under certain circumstances, and as required by applicable law you have the right to:

Request access to your personal information. This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you.
Request correction of any incomplete or inaccurate personal information that we hold about you.
Request erasure of your personal information when there is no need for us continuing to process it or you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below).
Object to processing of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.
Request the restriction of processing of your personal information to suspend the processing, for example if you want us to verify its accuracy or the reason for processing it.
Request the transfer of your personal information to another party.

If you want to exercise any of these rights, please contact the Data Protection Officer in writing per the ‘Where to turn with questions’ section of this Policy. Valid requests will be honored within 30 calendar days of request. This 30-day period may be extended for another 2 months for complex requests with notification of the reasons for the extension to you. Any such requests should be submitted using the information listed in the Contact Information section.
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. In addition, there may be requests that we are unable to process because of other EU legal requirements.  If a request is denied, we will notify you of the reason.
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
If you are located in the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU Supervisory Authority. However, if you have a complaint regarding the processing of your personal information we request that you first contact us and we will reply on timely basis.
If you have a rights request, please contact us using the information in the “Contact Information” section of this Privacy Policy.
