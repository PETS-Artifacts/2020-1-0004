Our Security Practices and Information Accuracy


            TaxSlayer understands the importance of protecting customer information.  TaxSlayer adheres to regulatory, security, and privacy standards applicable to the tax preparation industry.  TaxSlayer’s web-based and desktop applications have a proven record of securing Taxpayer information by utilizing a variety of security related technologies including, but not limited to, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, web application firewalls, encryption, access controls, network isolation, auditing systems, data classifications, and data obfuscation.  In order to protect the data as our client enters it in the system, TaxSlayer incorporates the use of SSL encryption facilitated by an Extended Validation SSL Certificate issued by a recognized trusted certificate authority.  TaxSlayer utilizes security guards, access controls, biometrics, man traps, and other security mechanisms to protect physical access to the datacenter.
        

TaxSlayer’s information systems maintain PCI compliance which must be renewed annually. Additionally, our systems are routinely subject to automated vulnerability testing purposely exceeding the requirements of PCI compliance.
