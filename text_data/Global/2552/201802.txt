The American Institute of Physics (AIP) is committed to protecting your privacy and values your trust. This Privacy Policy describes the information that we collect from you, how we collect this information, and what we do with it after we collect it.
What information is collected and how it is used
Personal Information. We collect Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us, such as your name and email address, to receive services such as email alerts and newsletters. We may use your email address to contact you from time to time about new offers or product enhancements. We may also use page tags (a.k.a. “web beacons”) in html-based emails which allow us to see whether specific users have opened, forwarded, or clicked on a link in an email. Information about what users are interested in helps us to improve our offerings. We will not share or sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization.
Non-Personal Information. We use cookies to track user activity on the site and also to collect non-personal information, such as your browser type, operating system, and the URL of the previous website you visited. We anonymize Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Knowing more about who uses our site and how they use it helps us to make improvements. This information is maintained and used in aggregate form only and does not contain personally identifiable information.
Notice to EU Users: The server for www.aip.org is located in the United States. By entering information on this site, you are consenting to the transfer of that information to the United States. Your information will be handled in accordance with AIP's Privacy Policy.
How collected information is used
The primary purpose of gathering information is to allow AIP to link a name and contact information to a user ID or to enhance your browsing experience. Once you have provided appropriate information, you will be enabled to use a variety of products or personalized services, and to access online help or support.
AIP has a policy to use or sell its customer lists only for the delivery of information deemed of potential relevance or interest to members of the physics community. AIP offers an option to remove your information from any list that might be sold or given to another organization. To do so, please contact the appropriate AIP department with which the list is associated.
We may share aggregated (i.e., non-individual) demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This aggregated information cannot be related to identifiable individuals.
How we keep information secure
AIP is committed to safeguarding your information. We make commercially reasonable efforts to protect your information both online and off-line.
Data security To maintain data security we have put in place appropriate procedures to safeguard all sensitive information.
All online purchases you make with AIP are secured with SSL (secure socket layer) encryption using encryption certificates issued to AIP by well-known and reputable certificate authorities such as VeriSign and RapidSSL. You will know that you are in a secure session because the "http" in the URL box of your browser will read "https".
AIP continually monitors the security status of its networks and has taken appropriate measures to ensure intrusion prevention.
Ecommerce
AIP adheres to the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard developed to protect account and transaction information of cardholders. We partner with a secure and reliable payment system provider and employ industry-standard anti-fraud measures.
Opt-out for European Union and other users

If you configure your browser to reject cookies, you may still use some, but not all, portions of our site. We recommend closing browsers on publicly available machines (such as those in libraries) after use.
Links
AIP sites contain links to other sites, and other sites have links to AIP. Please be aware that AIP is not responsible for the privacy practices (or other practices, goods, services, or content) of other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site that collects personally identifiable information.
