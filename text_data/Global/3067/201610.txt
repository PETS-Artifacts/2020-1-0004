Collection of General Information
Our web servers automatically collect some non-identifying basic information from your visit to help measure website activity and improve our site. This information includes your IP address, browser type, computer type, the pages requested, and the referring website.
Like many other websites, the James Beard Foundation website occasionally deposits bits of information called "cookies" in a visitor's computer. Cookies help us distinguish repeat visitors from first-time visitors and give us helpful information about how our pages are viewed. This technology does not collect personal, identifiable information.
Volunteering Personal Data
You may voluntarily submit your email address or other personally identifying data to take part in an activity on the site, such as to sign up for a mailing list. In this case, we will use your data to send you the requested information. We may also send you occasional messages about other James Beard Foundation programs and information sources. You can unsubscribe from a James Beard Foundation mailing list at any time by responding to the instructions provided at the bottom of each message. We do not share our email lists with other organizations.
