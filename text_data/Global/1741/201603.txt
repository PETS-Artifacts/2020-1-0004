Information Voluntarily Provided by Users:

You can visit much of Bumrungrad Web without telling us who you are or providing us with other personally identifiable information. Some areas of the Bumrungrad Web allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information. We use this information so that we can respond more efficiently and keep track of our correspondence.

When you request an appointment we will ask for additional information. Our purpose is to begin identifying your medical and timing needs so that we can propose or schedule the appropriate services for you. This also helps us begin setting up a record for you, so that registration is easier when you arrive at the hospital. Finally, by requesting some basic information we discourage correspondence from those who are not serious about their healthcare, or might be contacting us for the wrong reasons. This allows us to focus more attention on patients who genuinely seek our help.
