Reasons we Share the Information we Collect
We do not sell or otherwise disclose information we collect to others except as described in this statement. Bentley may share your information we collect with its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. In  some cases Bentley may share information we collect with  vendors or agents working on our behalf for any purposes described in in this  statement. For example, we may share information for  purposes of data processing or storage, delivering customer support, processing  credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf. In such cases, these  companies must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and are not  allowed to use your information for any other purpose. 
Some Bentley Web pages allow  you to choose to share your information with select Bentley partners so that  they can contact you about their products, services, or offers. Other sites do  not share your contact information with third parties for marketing purposes,  but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive  communications from Bentley on behalf of external business partners about a partner’s  particular offering (without transferring your information to the third party). 
Some Bentley services may  be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register  for or use such services, both Bentley and the other company may receive  information collected in connection with the co-branded services. 
We occasionally hire  other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the  processing and delivery of mailings, providing user or customer support,  hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis  of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the  information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the  confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any  other purpose. 
We may access and/or  disclose information we collect if we believe such  action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on  Bentley; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bentley (including  the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to  protect the personal safety of users of Bentley services or members of the  public.
If we merge with another  company or reorganize some part or all of our business, assets, or stock  (including if we file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share information we collect from and about you in connection with  the merger or reorganization. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and  that any acquirer may continue to use information we  collect from and about you as set forth in this privacy statement.
 
Your Choices and Controls
You may have the ability  to view or edit information we collect from and about  you online. To help prevent this information from being viewed by others,  you will be required to sign in with your credentials (e.g. username and  password). The appropriate method(s) for accessing your information will depend  on which sites or services you have used. Some Bentley Web pages or services  may collect information that you may be able to access through alternative  means of access described by the service. Or you can use our contact  us form and we will contact you within 30 days regarding  your request. 
You can stop the delivery of future promotional email  from Bentley and services by following the specific instructions set forth in  such promotional email. You may also have the option of proactively making  choices about the communications you receive from Bentley by contacting us. We  may send out email periodically informing you of administrative and technical  service issues about the products and services that you are using. These  communications are considered essential to the provision of the service you  have requested. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe to these  mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen. You  can also click here about the types of cookies and  similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your  choices.
 
Other Important Privacy Information
Security  of Your Information
Bentley is committed to  protecting the security of information we collect from and about you. We use a  variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect this information  from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the  information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located  in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information  (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it  through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
If a password is used to  help protect your accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep  your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you  are sharing a computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before  leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent  users. 
Collection  and Use of Children’s Information
Bentley Web pages and  services are intended for general audiences and do not knowingly collect any  personal information from children. When a Bentley Web page does collect age  information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either  block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain  consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of their children’s personal  information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide  more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services. Bentley  strongly encourages you to talk with your children about communicating with  strangers and disclosing personal information online and about using the  Internet safely.
Use of  Cookies
We  and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies on our websites,  services, applications, tools, and electronic communications (collectively  referred to as our “sites and services”) that  automatically receive and track certain data about your device and interaction  with our sites and services. You can read more here about the types of  cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can  exercise your choices.
Use of Third-Party Ad Networks
The majority of the  online banner advertisements you see on Bentley Web pages are displayed by Bentley.  However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad  networks, to display advertisements on Bentley Web pages. Some of these ad  networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer in order to recognize  your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad  networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your  computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked. This  information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they  believe will be of most interest to you. Bentley does not have access to nor  does it control the cookies that may be placed on your computer by the third-party  ad servers or ad networks. You can read more  here about the types of cookies and similar technologies we use, why we use them,  and how you can exercise your choices. 
Bentley maintains  relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating.  Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of  ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the  individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative. 
Links to  Other Sites
Bentley Web pages may  contain links to other sites. Bentley is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of other websites. Please refer to the policies of the  respective site. 
Links to  Bentley Web Pages or Services
You are welcome to  establish a hypertext link to our sites and services as long as the link does  not state or imply Bentley’s sponsorship of your site. However, you may not use  any Bentley logo in conjunction with the link without obtaining Bentley’s prior  express permission to do so. Bentley reserves the right to revoke this  courtesy, at its sole discretion. You may not link to our sites or services  through a frame. 
Controlling  Spam or Unsolicited Email
Bentley is concerned  about controlling unsolicited commercial email, or spam. Bentley will not sell,  lease, or rent its email subscriber lists to third parties. While Bentley  continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded  filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will  totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited email. Using various email  client tools and being cautious about the sharing of your email address while  online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited email you receive. By using  or otherwise accessing Bentley Web pages, you agree not to gather any email addresses  for spamming purposes. 
Miscellaneous
Bentley Web pages may  include inaccuracies or typographical errors. Bentley may make improvements  and/or changes in the products, services, programs, and prices described in  Bentley Web pages at any time without notice. Pennsylvania law and controlling  U.S. federal law will govern any action arising from use of Bentley Web pages.

When we make changes, we will post the "Last Revised" date at the top of  this statement so you know when those changes were made. If there are material  changes to this statement or in how Bentley will use information we collect  from and about you, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice  of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a  notification.
