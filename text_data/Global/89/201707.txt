Reasons we Share the Information we Collect
We do not sell or  otherwise disclose information we collect to others except as described in this  Privacy Statement. Bentley may share your information we collect with our  controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. 
In some cases Bentley may share information we collect with vendors or agents working on our behalf for any purposes described in in this Privacy Statement. For example, we may share information for purposes of data processing or storage, delivering customer support, processing credit card payments, and sending emails on our behalf. In such cases, these companies will be permitted to obtain only the information they need to deliver the respective services and are not allowed to use your information for any other purpose, except where required by law. Such vendors and agents must abide by our data privacy and security requirements and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information, except where required by law to disclose your information. Bentley may also share information with carefully selected strategic partners who provide services and sponsor events that may be of interest to you. These companies are obligated to protect your information and use it in accordance with their own privacy policies and practices.
Some Bentley webpages  allow you to choose to share your information with select Bentley partners so  that they can contact you about their products, services, or offers. Other  sites do not share your contact information with third parties for marketing  purposes, but instead may give you a choice as to whether you wish to receive  communications from Bentley on behalf of external business partners about a  partner’s particular offering (without transferring your information to the  third party).
Some Bentley services  may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you  register for or use such services, both Bentley and the other company may  receive information collected in connection with the co-branded services. The  other company's use of your information is subject to such other company's own  privacy policies and practices, and Bentley is not responsible for the privacy  practices of, or use of your information by, such other companies.
We may access and/or disclose  information we collect if we believe such action is necessary to: (a) comply  with the law or legal process served on Bentley; (b) protect and defend the  rights or property of Bentley (including the enforcement of our agreements) or  third parties; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal  safety of users of Bentley services or members of the public. If we merge with  another company or reorganize some part or all of our business, assets, or  stock (including if we file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding), we may share  information we collect from and about you in connection with the merger or  reorganization. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any  acquirer may continue to use information we collect from and about you as set  forth in this Privacy Statement.
 
Your Choices and Controls
You may have the  ability to view or edit information we collect from and about you online. To  help prevent this information from being viewed by others, you will be required  to sign in with your credentials (e.g. username and password). The appropriate  method(s) for accessing your information will depend on which sites or services  you have used. Some Bentley webpages or services may collect information that  you may be able to access through alternative means of access described by the  service. Or you can use our contact us form and we will contact you within 30 days  regarding your request.
You can stop the  delivery of future promotional email from Bentley and services by following the  specific instructions set forth in such promotional email. You may also have  the option of proactively making choices about the communications you receive  from Bentley by contacting us. However, we may send out emails periodically  informing you of administrative and technical service issues about the products  and services that you are using. These communications are considered essential  to the provision of the service you have requested. You will not be able to  choose to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the  service you have chosen.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (EU RESIDENTS)
  Bentley complies with  the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of  Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information  transferred from the European Union to the United States. Bentley has certified  to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles  of Notice, Choice, Accountability for  Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability, and the 16 Supplemental  Principles (collectively, "Privacy Shield Principles"). Such adherence is subject to investigation and enforcement by  the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 
Bentley's  participation in the Privacy Shield applies to all personal information that is  subject to this Privacy Statement and is received by or on behalf of Bentley from  the European Union and European Economic Area. Bentley will comply with the  Privacy Shield Principles in respect of such personal information. If there is  any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Statement and the Privacy Shield  Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern in respect of such  personal information. Bentley’s adherence to the Privacy Shield Principles may  be limited to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest,  or law enforcement requirements.
Bentley’s  accountability for personal information that it receives under the Privacy  Shield framework and subsequently transfers to a third party is described in  the Privacy Shield Principles. In particular, Bentley remains responsible and  liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if third-party agents that we engage  to process personal information on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent  with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible  for the event giving rise to the damage.
You have the right to  access your personal information maintained by Bentley under the Privacy Shield  framework, and to correct, amend or delete such information where it is  inaccurate or processed unlawfully, as described in the Privacy Shield  Principles. To exercise these rights, please contact us by clicking on this contact us link.
In addition, Bentley provides individuals with certain choices regarding how we use and disclose personal information we receive under the Privacy Shield framework. First, if Bentley uses your personal information for a materially different purpose than that for which it was originally collected or discloses your personal information to a third party (other than third party providers acting on our behalf), we will first provide you with a clear, conspicuous, and readily available mechanism to opt-out of any such use or disclosure (for example, by sending you an email seeking your consent). Further, all of our email communications include the ability to opt-out from receiving future emails, except those emails that are necessary to provide you with the services you have requested or purchased. If you have any questions about your choices regarding how we use and disclose your personal information, or how to exercise these choices, please contact us via our contact us form.
We encourage you to  contact us should you have a Privacy Shield-related (or general privacy-related)  complaint or inquiry by clicking on this contact us link.  For any complaints that cannot be resolved with Bentley directly, Bentley has  chosen to cooperate with the  American Arbitration Association, an alternative dispute resolution  provider, to resolve such complaints at no charge to you. Please visit http://info.adr.org/safeharbor for more information and to file a complaint.  As further explained in the Privacy Shield Principles, a binding arbitration  option will also be made available to you to address residual complaints not  resolved by any other means.

Other Important Privacy Information
Security of Your  Information
Bentley is committed to protecting the security of information we collect from  and about you. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help  protect this information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For  example, we store the information you provide on computer systems with limited  access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly  confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the  Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure  Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is used to help protect your  accounts and information, it is your responsibility to keep your password  confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a  computer with anyone you should always choose to log out before leaving a site  or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.
Collection and Use of  Children’s Information
Bentley webpages and services are intended for general audiences and we do not  knowingly collect any personal information from children. When a Bentley webpage  does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the  site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will  seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use, and sharing of  their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under  the age of 13 to provide personal information to us. Bentley strongly  encourages you to talk with your children about communicating with strangers  and disclosing personal information online and about using the Internet safely.
Use of Cookies
We and our approved partners use cookies and similar technologies on our  websites, services, applications, tools, and electronic communications  (collectively referred to as our “sites and services”) that automatically  receive and track certain data about your device and interaction with our sites  and services. You can read more here about the types of cookies and similar  technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.
Use of Third-Party Ad Networks
The majority of the  online banner advertisements you see on Bentley webpages are displayed by  Bentley. However, we allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad  networks, to display advertisements on Bentley webpages. Some of these ad  networks may place a persistent cookie on your computer to recognize your  computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad  networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your  computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked. This  information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they  believe will be of most interest to you. Bentley does not have access to nor  does it control the cookies that may be placed on your computer by the  third-party ad servers or ad networks. You can read more here about the types of cookies and similar  technologies we use, why we use them, and how you can exercise your choices.
Bentley maintains  relationships with a number of third-party ad networks currently operating.  Those ad networks that use persistent cookies may offer you a way to opt out of  ad targeting. You may find more information at the website of either the  individual ad network or the Network Advertising Initiative.
Links to  Other Sites
Bentley webpages may  contain links to other sites. Bentley is not responsible for the privacy  practices or the content of other websites. Please refer to the policies of the  respective site.

When we make changes, we will post the "Last  Revised" date at the top of this Privacy Statement so you know when  those changes were made. If there are material changes to this Privacy  Statement or in how Bentley will use information we collect from and about you,  we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior  to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We  encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Statement to be informed of  how Bentley is protecting your information.
