Privacy Policy
Website Visitors

  Like most website operators, iNaturalist.org collects
  non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
  servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
  preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
  iNaturalist.org's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
  information is to better understand how iNaturalist.org's visitors use its
  website. From time to time, iNaturalist.org may release
  non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing
  a report on trends in the usage of its website.


  iNaturalist.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information
  like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. iNaturalist.org does not use such
  information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
  information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
  discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

  Certain visitors to iNaturalist.org's website choose to interact with
  iNaturalist.org in ways that require iNaturalist.org to gather
  personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
  iNaturalist.org gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each
  case, iNaturalist.org collects such information only insofar as is necessary
  or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
  iNaturalist.org. iNaturalist.org does not disclose personally-identifying
  information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to
  supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may
  prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Aggregated Statistics

  iNaturalist.org may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
  website. For instance, iNaturalist.org may reveal how many downloads a
  particular observation got. However, iNaturalist.org does not disclose
  personally-identifying information other than as described below.

Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

  iNaturalist.org discloses potentially personally-identifying and
  personally-identifying information only to those of its programmers,
  contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
  information in order to process it on iNaturalist.org's behalf or to provide
  services available at iNaturalist.org's websites, and (ii) that have agreed
  not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
  affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
  using iNaturalist.org's websites, you consent to the transfer of such
  information to them. iNaturalist.org will not rent or sell potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone.
  Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as
  described above, iNaturalist.org discloses potentially
  personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
  required to do so by law, or when iNaturalist.org believes in good faith
  that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
  iNaturalist.org, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a
  registered user of iNaturalist.org and have supplied your email address,
  iNaturalist.org may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
  features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
  going on with iNaturalist.org and our products. We primarily use blogs and
  groups to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
  type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a
  support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right
  to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to
  help us support other users. iNaturalist.org takes all measures reasonably
  necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or
  destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
  information.

Cookies

  A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
  computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time
  the visitor returns. iNaturalist.org uses cookies to help iNaturalist.org
  identify and track visitors, their usage of iNaturalist.org website, and
  their website access preferences. iNaturalist.org visitors who do not wish
  to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to
  refuse cookies before using iNaturalist.org's websites, with the drawback
  that certain features of iNaturalist.org's websites may not function
  properly without the aid of cookies.

Privacy Policy Changes

  Although most changes are likely to be minor, iNaturalist.org may change its
  Privacy Policy from time to time, and in iNaturalist.org's sole discretion.
  iNaturalist.org encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any
  changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any
  change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such
  change.
