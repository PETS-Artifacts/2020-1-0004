Marcus Theatres Privacy Policy
Marcus Theatres Corporation values its relationships with its guests. As part of its commitment to providing best-in-class service to our guests, Marcus has created this policy to describe its policies regarding its collection of information from consumers, its use of such information, and its privacy practices with respect to same. In order to make informed decisions regarding your personal information, Marcus strongly urges you to review this policy completely and carefully.
This privacy policy applies to information collected by Marcus Theatres Corporation, its subsidiaries, licensees, and affiliated companies (collectively, “Marcus”) through your (i) use of Marcus’s website and/or mobile application(s), (ii) participation in the Magical Movie Rewards loyalty program, or any sweepstakes, promotion, or survey offered by Marcus, and (iii) disclosure of personal information to Marcus through any other means. While your acceptance of this policy is voluntary, your continued use and/or participation in any of the foregoing constitute your acceptance of this policy and any other applicable terms.
How Marcus Collects and Uses Data. For each visitor to our website, our web server automatically recognizes only the consumer’s domain name, not email address. When you visit the Marcus website, Marcus automatically collects data on your website usage and online behavior, e.g., previous websites you visited, your computer’s web browser, operating system, and IP address, and how you navigate and interact with the Marcus site.
When you register for the Magical Movie Rewards program, you will be asked to provide your name, street address, email address, phone number, birthday, and other marketing preferences. Through your participation in the Magical Movie Rewards program, Marcus may collect information on your theatre movie transactions as well as concessions and food and beverage purchase at our theaters, including, without limitation, the movies you see, concession items you purchase, and theatres you attend.
Marcus may also collect additional information from you, depending on how you engage with Marcus. For example, Marcus may collect information from you if you post messages to our bulletin board, communicate with us through email or online comment cards, or participate in surveys or site registrations. While Marcus generally limits the use of such information to its own internal use to address guest concerns and improve the guest experience, Marcus may post guest feedback and comments on its website or on social media.
Marcus uses information collected from you in a number of ways, including, without limitation, to improve the content and navigation of Marcus’s website and mobile applications, to assist in the marketing and promotion of films, events, and Marcus products in which you may be interested, to communicate with you for customer services purposes, and to prevent and detect fraud or other misuse of our website, mobile application, Magical Movie Rewards program, and promotions. Further, Marcus routinely shares this information with third parties, such as motion picture distributors, industry data sharing services, and promotional and other business partners.
Marcus takes reasonable measures and implements appropriate safeguards to protect your personal information. However, by agreeing to this policy, you acknowledge that transmission of information over the Internet is, inherently, not secure. Security breaches cannot be prevented entirely, and by continuing to use the Marcus websites and applications, you accept the risk that a security breach may occur.
Third parties. Marcus may retain third parties to place and manage advertisements on its website and mobile applications. These third parties may automatically collect information from you, through cookies and other technology, in order to provide you with advertisements for goods and services in which you may be interested.
In addition, the Marcus website may contain links to other websites that are not operated or controlled by Marcus, including to our online ticketing vendor and social networking sites. Marcus does not endorse the content, nor make any assurances about the security, of these websites. Marcus is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of third party websites. This policy applies only to the information collected by Marcus as specified in this policy. It is your responsibility to understand the individual privacy policies of any website you visit.
Cookies. The Marcus website uses cookies to pre-populate your Magical Movie Rewards loyalty card number (if you have previously accessed your account through the website), so that you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the site. Marcus does not use cookies in any other way. However, advertisers that place ads on the Marcus website may use their own cookies, which collect their own information independent of Marcus’ activities. You may adjust your browser’s settings to alert you when a site is attempting to send a cookie and allow you to refuse cookies.
Website use by children under 13 years of age. Marcus does not specifically target its websites and applications to children under 13 years old. If you are under the age of 13, you should only use our website and applications under the supervision of a parent or guardian.
Policy Changes. Marcus reserves the right to change this policy at any time without notice. You are responsible for keeping apprised of the current policy; thus, Marcus encourages you to check the policy periodically. The policy posted at www.marcustheatres.com/about-marcus-theatres/privacy-policy is the current policy. Your continued use and/or participation in any Marcus website, mobile application, loyalty program, promotion, etc., constitute your acceptance of any revised policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Marcus will endeavor to provide notice of any material changes to this policy by sending an email explaining such changes to you at your email address on file with Marcus if you are a Magical Movie Rewards member and by posting notice to Marcus’s website.
Disclosures. Marcus may be required to share personal information with law enforcement or government agencies as a result of a court order, subpoena, or as otherwise required by law. Additionally, Marcus may disclose your information as part of a planned or potential corporate sale, merger, reorganization, consolidation, or similar events. Your information will be treated as an asset and be transferred to the purchaser as part of a sale or other transaction.
Opting Out. You are never obligated to provide Marcus with any personal information. At any time, if you would like to cease receiving communications from Marcus or limit Marcus’s ability to share your information with third parties, you may “opt out.” If you do not want to receive communications from Marcus in the future or have personal information shared with third parties, email guestservice@marcustheatres.com or call 800.274.0099 and indicate your preference.
