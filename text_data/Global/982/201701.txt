Comments and other public activities
We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on TED.com. "Public activities" are any actions you take that are designed to be visible to other users -- including comments, recommendations and ratings. If you choose to engage in public activities, any personal information you submit there can be read, collected or used by other users of these areas. Your account is public by default. Please refer to the Community Guidelines about how to best take advantage of our interactive spaces.
We are not responsible for personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. Information shared here could be used by others, potentially to send you unsolicited messages. If the information posted publicly is not consistent with our terms of use, your content may be removed. For more information, see the TED.com Terms of Use.
