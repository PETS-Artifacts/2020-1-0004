The Full Detailed Privacy Policy


1. What Information Does the Site Collect?

(a)
Information You Provide to Us

Personal Information and Demographic Information.
 On the Site, we may ask you to provide us with certain categories of information such as: (1) personally
      identifiable information, which is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, home
      address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, and social security or tax payer identification number
      (“
      Personal Information”); and (2) demographic information, such as information about 
      your gender, age, marital status and education level(“
      Demographic Information”). We may collect this information through various forms and in various places on
      the Site, including when you complete a university application form, seminar registration form or information request form or
      when you otherwise interact with the Site. To the extent we combine Demographic Information with your Personal Information we
      collect from you directly on the Site, we will treat the combined data as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

(b) Information Collected and Stored As You Access and Use the Site

In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our
      third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain
      information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“ 
      Usage Information”). This Usage Information may be stored or accessed using a variety of technologies that
      may be downloaded to your personal computer, browser, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “
      Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site. To the extent we associate Usage Information with
      your Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Site, we will treat it as Personal Information.
This Usage Information may include:

your IP address, UDID or other unique identifier (“
        Device Identifier”). A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device used
        to access the Site, and our computers identify your Device by its Device Identifier;
your Device functionality (including browser, operating system, hardware, mobile network information);
the URL that referred you to our Site;
the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your
        preferences;
your Device location;
your Device characteristics; and
certain other Device data, including the time of day, among other information.

We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“
      Tracking Technologies”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations
      on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and
      methods later developed):


Cookies
 . A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared
      object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your
      Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a
      plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial
      browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use
      will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these
      tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to
      Adobe’s web site 
      www.adobe.com. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or
      HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your
      ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.


Web Beacons
 . Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear
      GIFs”) may be included in our Site’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or
      other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be
      used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate
      the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were
      actually viewed.


Embedded Scripts
 . An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the
      Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third
      party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.


Browser Fingerprinting
 . Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system,
      plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.


ETag, or entity tag
 . A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of
      a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in
      this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer
      blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.

Tracking Technologies Usage. We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:


Strictly Necessary
 . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and
      access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of
      shopping‑cart functionality.


Performance‑Related
 . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site,
      including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the
      Site.


Functionality‑Related
 . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when
      accessing the Site, including identifying you when you sign‑in to our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences,
      including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.


Targeting‑Related
 . We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Site and
      third‑party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content. This includes using Tracking Technologies
      to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that havebeen delivered to you. Further information on
      this, and your opt-out choices, is found in 
      Section 6 below.

Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.

We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your
      consent is meaningfully informed.

Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track .
There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third
      parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your
      online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking
      Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking
      Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the
      Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.
Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice
      regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party
      web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with
      respect to these do not track signals or other mechanisms.

(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You

We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Site, such as when they submit information
      to us on your behalf. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our
      Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor
      our content to you and to offer you courses that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive
      from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we
      will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do
      our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties, even if they have used
      our technology to collect it and share it with us.

(d)
Interactions with Third-Party Services

The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and a third-party web site
      or application. For example, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate sending a
      communication from the Site and we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third
      parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’
      practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. St. Matthew's University may not control or have access to your
      communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services
      and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party
      privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.

(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party

You may send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending an invitation to a friend. If so, the information
      you provide (names, email addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other
      marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use
      any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in
      the communication sent to your addressee(s). Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy
      policies.
2. How Do We Use the Information Collected?

(a) Use of Information by Us . We may use your Personal Information, Demographic Information or Usage
      Information that is subject to this Privacy Policy:

to provide you with information or services or process transactions that you have requested or agreed to receive or to
        provide you with marketing materials or services on behalf of us or third parties;

(b) Use of Information for Recruitment Purposes. Where you have provided us with Personal Information or
      Demographic Information as part of an online application for employment or internship, we may use that information in order
      to allow us to make an informed decision about whether to proceed with your application. We may, as part of this recruitment
      process, collect information about your education, employment history and similar matters. Where this Personal Information or
      Demographic Information is considered to be sensitive, you expressly consent to our processing of this information for
      recruitment purposes by submitting it to us.

(c) Interest-Based Advertising and Location-Based Services. We may also use your Personal Information,
      Demographic Information or Usage Information that we collect about you: (1) to specifically target relevant advertisements or
      content to you based on how you interact with our Site; (2) to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements or
      content that have been delivered to you; and (3) to increase our Site profile, including allowing you to comment or add
      content to the Services.

(d) Contact Us. Please note that information submitted to any of the Services via a “contact us” or
      other similar customer inquiry function may not receive a response. We may use the information provided by you in a customer
      inquiry communication to contact you for marketing purposes unrelated to your request, but as described further in this
      Privacy Policy you may opt-out of such communications at any time.
3. How and When Do We Share Information with Third Parties?
We may share non-Personal Information, such as aggregated user statistics, with third parties. We may share your Device
      Identifiers with third parties along with data related to you and your activities. We do not share your Personal Information
      that we have collected directly from you on our Site with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes
      unless you have consented at the time you provide your Personal Information. If we de-identify data about you, it is not
      treated as Personal Information by us, and we may share it with others freely. In addition, we may share the information we
      have collected about you, including Personal Information, as disclosed at the time you provide your information and as
      described below or otherwise in this Privacy Policy. St. Matthew's University may disclose your information as

      user profiles, writings, music, video, audio recordings, computer graphics, pictures, data, questions, comments, suggestions
      or other content, including Personal Information (collectively, “
      User Content”), such as on blogs and message boards. We or others may store, display, reproduce, publish,
      distribute or otherwise use User Content online or offline in any media or format (currently existing or hereafter developed)
      and may or may not attribute it to you. Others may have access to this User Content and may have the ability to share it with
      third parties. Please think carefully before deciding what information you share, including Personal Information, in
      connection with your User Content. Please note that St. Matthew's University does not control who will have access to the
      information that you choose to make public, and cannot ensure that parties who have access to such publicly available
      information will respect your privacy or keep it secure. We are not responsible for the privacy or security of any
      information that you make publicly available on the Site or what others do with information you share with them on the Site.
      We are not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any User Content that you disclose or receive from third parties
      through the Site.

(b) Name and Likeness. We may also publish your name, voice, likeness and other Personal Information that is
      part of your User Content, and we may use the content, or any portion of the content, for advertising, marketing, publicity
      and promotional activities. For full terms and conditions regarding User Content you submit to the Site, please review our 
      Terms of Service.
5. Do Third-Party Content, Links to Third-Party Sites, and/or Third-Party Apps Appear on the Site?
The Site may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and
      your Device Identifier when pages from the Site are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Site you may be directed
      to other sites that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data
      collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their sites and they may be tracking you across
      multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others. For example, if you “click” on a
      link, the “click” may take you off the Site onto a different site. These other sites may associate their Tracking
      Technologies with you, independently collect data about you, including Personal Information, and may or may not have their
      own published privacy policies.
Third-party applications may also be available via the Site. The owners of these applications (“
      Third-Party Owners”) may collect Personal Information and other data from you and may have their own
      policies and practices. We are not responsible for how Third-Party Owners or their applications collect or use your
      information and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or
      others. These Third-Party Owners may have their own terms of service, privacy policies or other policies and ask you to agree
      to the same. We are not responsible for these third-party privacy policies or the practices of Third-Party Owners. Be sure to
      review any available policies before submitting any personally identifiable information to a third-party application or
      otherwise interacting with it and exercise caution in connection with these applications. We also encourage you to note when
      you leave our Site and to review the third-party privacy policies of all third-party locations and exercise caution in
      connection with them.
6. What About Ads?
Data about your activities online is being collected on our Site for use in providing advertising tailored to your
      individual interests. We may use third parties such as network advertisers and ad exchanges to serve advertisements across
      the Internet and may use third party analytics service providers to evaluate and provide us and/or third parties with
      information about the use of these ads on third party sites and viewing of ads and of our content. Network advertisers are
      third parties that display advertisements, which may be based on your visits to the Site. Third parties may offer you a
      choice as to whether or not to have your information collected for that purpose. This section of the Privacy Policy provides
      details and explains how to exercise that choice.
The Site’s third-party ad network and exchange providers, the advertisers, the sponsors and/or traffic measurement
      services may themselves set and access their own cookies (including Flash cookies), web beacons and other Tracking
      Technologies on your Device and track certain behavioral Usage Information regarding users of your Device via a Device
      Identifier. These third-party Tracking Technologies may be set to, among other things: (a) help deliver advertisements to you
      that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the
      usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology
      may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations.
      Note that any images (or any other parts of content) served by third parties in association with third-party ads or other
      content may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities.
Third-party Tracking Technologies are not controlled by us, even if they use our technology to help store or collect data.
      Statements regarding our practices do not apply to the methods for collecting information used by these third-party
      advertisers and others or the use of the information that such third parties collect. We do however work with third parties
      to make efforts to have you provided with the information on their practices and any available opportunity to exercise
      choice. The relevant third party’s terms of service, privacy policy, permissions, notices and choices should be reviewed
      regarding their collection, storage and sharing practices. We make no representations regarding the policies or practices of
      third-party advertisers or advertising networks or exchanges or related third parties.
However, some may offer you certain choices regarding their practices, and information we have been informed of regarding
      such choices is available at the 
      end of this Privacy Policy.
While we may use a variety of companies to serve advertisements, you may wish to visit 
      http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp,
      which provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“
      NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including the
      “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. Opting out of one or more NAI members only means that those NAI members no longer
      will be allowed under their own rules to deliver targeted content and/or ads to you, which will affect this and other sites,
      but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject
      cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different Device or change web
      browsers, your NAI opt-out may not, or may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on the NAI’s web
      site accessible by the above link. You may also be able to opt-out of receiving third-party behavioral ads on certain sites
      by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance (“
      DAA”) web site at 
      http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed. Similar limitations
      may apply to the DAA opt-out. We are not responsible for effectiveness of or compliance with any third-parties’ opt-out
      options.
