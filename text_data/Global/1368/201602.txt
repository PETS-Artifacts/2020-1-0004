INFORMATION GATHERED
          Web servers collect and log information about the computers connecting 
          to them. The antiqueradios.com server is no different. It logs the date 
          and time of each request for a page or file, along with other information 
          such as the browser being used, the operating system and the I.P. address 
          of the connecting computer and the file requested. This data is collected 
          and analyzed to improve the site.

          matches up the name(s) used for each I.P. address recorded.
