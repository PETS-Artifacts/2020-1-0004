MCCCD does not sell or distribute confidential information collected online to individuals or entities not affiliated with the college, except in the very limited circumstances described below. Non-confidential information may be sold or distributed pursuant to Arizona Public Records law.
MCCCD and the Governing Board policies protect the confidentiality of student educational records and employee personnel information. These policies explain what information may be shared with the public or anyone who requests it. They also explain what information is protected as confidential; confidential information will not be disclosed without the consent of the student or employee, except under subpoena, court order, or in case of an emergency.
 
Student Records
Student records are protected by the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), Arizona law, and MCCCD policy. Information about student access to education records and protection of education records is available on MCCCD’s Public Records and Information page. This policy also provides information on a student’s right to limit access to otherwise public directory information.
 
Chat Rooms
MCCCD does not routinely retain logs or copies of chat rooms, forums, message boards, or newsgroups available to its users. Information disclosed in these areas is public, however. Information such as name, email address, phone number, and program of interest will be used to provide you with the information you are requesting as well as information about other products and services offered by MCCCD.
Academic chat rooms and discussions conducted in connection with college classes may be logged but may be treated as confidential educational records under FERPA.
 
Employee Records
Employee records are protected by MCCCD policies and by Arizona law.
 
Public Records Law
Under the Arizona Public Records Law, MCCCD may be required to provide information in college records to a third party.

Confidential information protected by FERPA or by other laws or Governing Board policy will not be disclosed in response to a public records request. Additional information about Arizona public records law is available on MCCCD’s Public Records and Information page.
 
Contractors
From time to time, individuals or companies under contract with the MCCCD may have access to confidential information in the course of the service they provide to the university, but those entities are not permitted to use or re-disclose that information for unauthorized purposes.
