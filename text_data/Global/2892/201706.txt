Information We Collect
When visiting our websites, some information is collected electronically or by technology. For example, when accessing the Internet, each computer is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address that identifies where information is coming from or where information should be sent. Along with your IP address, we collect information regarding which pages you visit on our site, from which page you came to our site, and the software you use to visit our site and its configuration. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. When you use any shopping cart functions that may be included on our websites, your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. None of that information is associated with you as an individual.
Our websites also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. A Cookie is a collection of information stored on your computer that usually includes a username and the current date and time or other user specific information that helps us tailor our websites to your interests.

Contact information from these forms is used to respond to requests for information, send orders to you, or to contact you when necessary or requested. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/Opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services you have requested. Unique identifiers (such as Social Security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the your identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.
