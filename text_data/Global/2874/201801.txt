What Information We Collect and How We Use That Information: 
Our registration forms require users to give us contact information that may include name, email address, format preference (HTML vs. Text), address, interests, and similar information. We do not request or store sensitive information from our visitors, such as credit card or social security numbers. 
Your User Profile/Account
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any passwords associated with your ZERO TO THREE account, monitor all activity under your account, and assume full responsibility for all activities that occur under your account (unless ZERO TO THREE is the direct cause of a security breach).
Email address
Your email address helps us better communicate with you. For example, we use it to deliver ZERO TO THREE newsletters and respond to your questions. We also use it to deliver special offers to you from ZERO TO THREE and our partners conditioned on your agreement to accept such offers.
Password
Your password gives you access to nonpublic areas of the site and the Member Center (where your membership information is stored and can be updated).
Your name
Your name helps us personalize our site and our communications with you in various ways. It also helps us send special offers by postal mail if you have agreed to accept such offers.
Your address
It’s convenient to enter your address here so that it will be available for certain ZERO TO THREE services. For example, if you order from the ZERO TO THREE Bookstore, we’ll already know where to send your packages. We’ll also use it to send special offers or catalogs if you have agreed to accept such offers. In addition, knowing where our members live helps us tailor our site to meet your needs.
Your phone
Having your telephone number allows us to get in touch with you directly when appropriate – for example, if our Customer Service staff is helping you with an order from the ZERO TO THREE Bookstore, or to communicate special offers by phone if you have agreed to accept such offers.
Your child’s due date or birth date
One of the things visitors tell us they love best about ZERO TO THREE is getting relevant information about their children when they need it most. Knowing your child’s exact due date or date of birth enables us to provide that information – in formats such as email newsletters – tailored precisely for the stage of your child’s age. Your child’s birth date may also be used to help us compile overall, non-personal statistics about our visitors, which we share with advertisers, the media, or other third parties. For example, we might tell an advertiser that a certain number or percentage of our visitors have children born in a certain month and year.
Your Donor Information
All donor information, including names, beneficiaries, gift amounts, estate sizes, etc., is kept strictly confidential by ZERO TO THREE and its authorized staff unless permission is obtained from the donor to release the information.
