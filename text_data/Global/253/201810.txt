Learning Ally Privacy Policy
Updated: March 28, 2017

Learning Ally’s mission is to promote personal achievement when access and reading are barriers to learning by advancing the use of accessible and effective educational solutions.  Our website is an important tool in the pursuit of this mission.

Learning Ally is committed to safeguarding your information and protecting the privacy of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) gathered from individuals who utilize our services, visit our website and/or donate online, by phone, through mail or at events.

Our Privacy Policy below explains how we collect, store and use information gathered on our website. To update your contact or billing information, email subscription or direct mail preferences, please email custserv@LearningAlly.org.

Learning Ally complies with applicable U.S. laws that impose additional responsibilities on Learning Ally beyond those stated in this Policy in connection with the treatment of Personally Identifiable Information.


Collecting Information
Learning Ally does not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly, by registering for our services, requesting information from us, submitting a volunteer request or by making a donation. We do not sell names or other personal data that we collect on our website, nor do we maintain any credit card information.

Use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL Technology):
Learningally.org uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to provide you with the safest, most secure experience possible. SSL technology enables encryption (scrambling) of sensitive information, including passwords and credit card numbers, during your online transactions. All of the forms on our site are secured with SSL technology so your personal information stays safe and out of malicious hands.

Use of Cookies:
Cookies may be used to enhance your experience while using our website. Cookies are pieces of information that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as remembering your customized settings for viewing our site and saving your password.

Most people consider the use of cookies to be an industry standard. Your browser is probably set to accept cookies. However, if you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, it is possible that some areas of our website will not function optimally when you view them.

Non-personal Electronic Information:
Learning Ally uses non-personal electronic information, such as log files that record and collect information about general site traffic, site usage, and length of stay. We may use this data to improve our website’s performance or content. This data is used in aggregate and does not contain personally identifiable information.

Learning Ally uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports trends without identifying individual visitors. You can opt out of Google Analytics. For more information about how to opt out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use, please visit this Google page.

In addition, we may use Google's remarketing technology to advertise to visitors that have previously visited our site when those visitors go to other websites participating in the Google Display Network. Learning Ally and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party and third-party cookies together to inform and optimize ads based on a visitor's past visits to our website. Please go here for more information about remarketing or to opt-out of the Google remarketing cookie.

At times, in order to expand our list of prospective donors or schools, Learning Ally may purchase lists of like-minded organizations from a trustworthy third party.  To maintain our costs, we on occasion will exchange our mailing list with other like-minded organizations, through the same reputable third party.  Email addresses are never sold. To update your preference, please email custserv@LearningAlly.org.



Storing Information
All information provided to Learning Ally is transmitted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our website that is only accessible by Learning Ally employees who need access to personal identifiable information to perform a specific job. Voluntarily submitted data we collect through this site is stored on a secure, password protected server. Vendors we use to store data use industry-standard encryption technologies in the receipt and transfer of your voluntarily submitted data. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.



Sharing Information
Learning Ally limits the use of personally identifiable information and other information to provide you services, process your donations, inform you about Learning Ally and its programs and to improve our services and site content for you. We may send you information about our services, invitations to special events or solicitations for donations.

Learning Ally will not sell personally identifiable information (PII), nor do we use PII from education records to market to students. We may send you periodic emails on a variety of topics. You may start or stop receiving such emails at any time by sending an email to custserv@LearningAlly.org.

Learning Ally may also share information with consultants and affiliates for internal business purposes and may divulge personal information if such information is subpoenaed. In some situations, your personal information may be used on a confidential basis with third parties who perform a particular service on our behalf, such as sending emails.



Other Websites
Our website contains links to other websites, which have information and services that may be helpful.  These websites have their own privacy policies and practices. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website. Learning Ally assumes no responsibility for the privacy policies or information collection practices of websites other than its own. We encourage you to read the privacy policies on all such sites as their policies may be different than ours.



Access to Information
Review and Correction:
Procedures have been developed through which our members may, upon request, review and correct the personally identifiable information that has been collected from them by Learning Ally. These procedures may not, however, compromise the security, integrity and privacy of either Learning Ally own proprietary databases or databases licensed from third party companies.



Internet Protocol Address
We collect an internet protocol (IP) address from all visitors to our website. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our website, analyze trends, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the site and our products. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.



Changes to Policy
The Learning Ally Privacy Policy, as well as policies specific to the various operating departments within Learning Ally, will be periodically assessed against new technologies, business practices and our members’ changing needs. Learning Ally may, from time to time, modify this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technological and other developments.

Learning Ally reserves the right at any time and without notice to change this Privacy Policy simply by posting such changes on our website. Any such change will be effective immediately upon posting.
