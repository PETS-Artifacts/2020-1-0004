Jump to:

Your privacy is important to us at Olive Tree Bible Software ('Olive Tree'). So we've developed this privacy policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.  Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know you have any questions.
OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY
Your privacy is important to us.  Personal information is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person.  When you create an Olive Tree account or identification, register your products, purchase a product, download a software update, participate in an online survey, we may collect a variety of information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, contact preferences, and credit card information.
To better protect your personal information we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  It applies to all information you submit, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card number.  We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order, and when assisting with support issues.  We may also contact you from time to time with product updates, links to free downloads, and other product information that we think may be of interest to you.  We also use personal information to help us develop, deliver, and improve our products, services, content, and advertising, although again, we do not disclose personal information to any outside parties in this regard.
The personal information we collect allows us to keep you posted on Olive Tree's latest product announcements, software updates, and upcoming events. It also helps us to improve our services, content, and advertising. If you don't want to be on our mailing list, you can opt out anytime by following the unsubscribe directions in email correspondence that you receive from us.  From time to time, we may use your personal information to send important notices, such as communications about purchases and changes to our terms, conditions, and policies. Because this information is important to your interaction with Olive Tree, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.  You can review information about you that we have collected online and maintain by writing us at support@olivetree.com.  You can also call to request factual correction in your information.  To better safeguard your information, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
We also collect non-personal information ? data in a form that does not permit direct association with any specific individual (e.g. occupation, area code, zip code, unique device identifier, time zone, etc.).  We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personal information for any purpose.  However, if we combine non-personal information with personal information, then the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.
Please note that whenever you submit any information to us in connection with any Olive Tree related services, you consent to Olive Tree's processing of this information in the United States as necessary to provide the services in which you are participating.  We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
ONLINE PRIVACY AND CREDIT CARD PROTECTION POLICY
At Olive Tree, we want you to feel safe and secure when you provide us with your personal information online. For this reason we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your credit card and other sensitive information when you make product purchases or request technical assistance. The process of encryption minimizes the possibility of unauthorized individuals from viewing your information as it is securely transmitted over the Internet. Once received, your credit card information is not transmitted over the Internet again.  However, even with such protection policies and safeguard procedures in place, there is always the possibility of fraud occurring. If you believe unauthorized disclosure or use of your credit information has occurred, please follow the reporting procedures defined by your credit card's issuing bank and contact us immediately.  Most credit card companies cover all charges that result form unauthorized use of your credit card or may limit your liability to $50.
DATA SECURITY AND YOUR USE
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online or by telephone.
Olive Tree takes precautions including administrative, technical, and physical measures to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.  
However, when you use some Olive Tree products, services, or applications or post on an Olive Tree forum, chat room, or social networking service, the personal information you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.
COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES
Olive Tree's website, online services, interactive applications, email messages, and advertisements may use 'cookies' and other technologies. These technologies help us better understand user behavior, tell us which parts of our website people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. We treat information collected by cookies and other technologies as non-personal information. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information. Similarly, to the extent that non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.
Olive Tree and our partners also may use cookies and other technologies to remember personal information when you use our website, online services, and applications. Our goal in these cases is to make your experience with Olive Tree more convenient and personal.  For example, knowing your first name lets us welcome you the next time you visit the Olive Tree website.  Knowing someone using your computer or device has shopped for a certain product or used a particular service helps us make our advertising and email communications more relevant to your interests.  And knowing your contact information, product serial numbers, and information about your computer or device helps us register your products, personalize your operating system, set up your services, and provide you with better customer service.
As is true of most websites, we gather some information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet addresses, browser type and language, Internet service provider, referring and exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to understand and analyze trends, to administer the site, to learn about user behavior on the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Olive Tree may use this information in our marketing and advertising services.
THIRD PARTIES
Olive Tree websites, products, applications, and services may contain links to third-party websites, products, and services. Our products and services may also use or offer products or services from third parties ? for example, a third-party iPhone app. Information collected by third parties, which may include such things as location data or contact details, is governed by their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of those third parties.
On some rare circumstances, it may be necessary ? by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence ? for Olive Tree to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.  We may also disclose information about you if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our terms and conditions or protect our operations or users. Additionally, in the event of a reorganization, merger, or sale we may transfer any and all personal information we collect to the relevant third party.
OUR COMMITMENT TO YOUR PRIVACY
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Olive Tree employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
Olive Tree may update its Privacy Policy from time to time. When we change the policy in a material way, a notice will be posted on our website along with the updated Privacy Policy.
Please understand that if you utilize Olive Tree's website or services, then it is highly recommended that you review our Terms Of Service, and that if you utilize any of Olive Tree's software, then it is highly recommended that you review our End User's License Agreement, which both shall take precedence over any conflict of terms that may be referenced herein.

	it affects you, please feel free to contact us at:
