Privacy Policy
General notes

  The general privacy policy of the Adblock Plus project is to avoid collecting more data than
  is required for the extensions and the AdblockPlus.org website to function correctly.
  The data gathered is anonymized, if possible, and removed when no longer required. It is
  never shared with any third parties. This policy lists the data that is collected and
  the processing applied to it.

AdblockPlus.org website
Website logs

  All requests to the AdblockPlus.org website are recorded in the website logs. Data stored includes your IP address, the time at which the request was made, the web
  address accessed, the browser identifier and the referring page. This data is used to
  generate usage statistics as well as to investigate potential security issues and forum or blog
  spam. Detailed logs are retained for a period of 30 days, after which only the
  aggregated usage statistics remain.

Uninstallation page feedback

  After uninstalling Adblock Plus, you may be directed to a webpage that asks for your feedback. The webpage stores some application and platform related data anonymously. If you decide to submit feedback, we will also store it anonymously.

Stored IP addresses

  The web applications installed on AdblockPlus.org store your IP address when you create a
  forum post, add a blog comment or translate a page. This allows administrators to
  effectively address spam content and security breaches. All stored IP addresses are
  removed after 30 days.

Cookies

  Several areas of the Adblock Plus website use cookies to recognize signed in users or to store
  settings. Cookies are not evaluated in any other manner and are never used to
  track website visitors.

Forum registration

  Data entered during forum registration is used to form the user's public profile
  and is therefore visible to other forum visitors. 


  There are two exceptions:



    Passwords go through one-way encryption before they are stored on the server.
    This means that they cannot be recovered by anyone, even with access to the database.
  

    Email addresses are only displayed in the public profile if explicitly agreed to.
    By default, they are only used for the sending of notifications to which you subscribed.
  


  Registration is not required to participate in the forums.


  When a comment is added on the Adblock Plus blog, an email address can be
  optionally specified. Unlike the other fields, it is never displayed and
  is only used to notify the comment author about replies.

Adblock Plus extensions
Extension update checks

  Your browser periodically checks for updates of all your extensions including Adblock
  Plus. Some general information, such as browser version, extension version, operating
  system and your IP address, are transmitted during an update check. Adblock Plus nightly
  build updates, as well as updates for Adblock Plus for Android and Internet Explorer, are handled
  by the AdblockPlus.org website and the data transmitted is subject to
  its privacy policy. Updates to stable
  Adblock Plus for Firefox releases are handled by the Addons.Mozilla.Org website and are subject
  to the Firefox Privacy
  Policy. Updates to stable Adblock Plus for Chrome releases are handled by the
  Google Web Store website and are subject to the
  Google Privacy Policy. Updates
  to stable Adblock Plus for Opera releases are handled by the Opera Add-ons website and are
  subject to the Opera privacy policy.

Subscription downloads

  If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription
  will be requested to regularly retrieve updates. Every update results in the hosting
  website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus
  version, browser and browser version. This data is subject to the privacy policy of the
  website in question.


  Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated
  address of the filter list is requested from the AdblockPlus.org domain. The data
  transmitted includes the Adblock Plus version, subscription address and any information about the
  error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by
  subscription maintainers and is subject to the usual
  AdblockPlus.org privacy policy.

Issue reporter

  Adblock Plus for Firefox allows you to send issue reports that will be
  temporarily stored on the AdblockPlus.org domain. These reports contain information
  required to investigate the issue including the Adblock Plus version, browser version,
  address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page,
  matching filters and active subscriptions. Parameter values are removed from all
  transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information. It is also
  possible to provide additional information, which may be privacy-sensitive:



    A website screenshot provides a scaled-down and color-reduced version of the page
    viewed. It is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before
    the report is sent.
  

    The email address is only used to request more information or to update the user on the issue.
  

    A list of installed extensions is necessary for the investigation of conflicts with other
    extensions.
  


  The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique address.
  These addresses are only shared with the maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in
  the report and are unlikely to be found by others unless a link is provided. All
  reports and their associated data are automatically removed after 30 days.

Emergency notification

  Recent Adblock Plus versions contain an emergency notification mechanism that allows them to
  notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation. This
  feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org
  domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes
  your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock
  Plus version, browser and browser version. This data allows serving different
  notifications to different clients and is subject to the usual
  AdblockPlus.org privacy policy.

Further requests

  Adblock Plus may make further requests to the AdblockPlus.org website as required. For
  example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs
  to be downloaded. These requests are subject to the usual
  AdblockPlus.org privacy policy.

Data retention

  Adblock Plus stores some data in
  the Firefox profile
  on your computer. Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other
  extensions and services, such as
  Firefox Sync,
  may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom
  filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent
  issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. Adblock Plus treats
  this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser: this data
  isn't stored if you are using
  Private Browsing mode
  and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.

Element Hiding Helper extension
Extension update checks

  Your browser periodically checks for updates of your extensions including the Element Hiding
  Helper extension (Firefox-specific). Some general information, such as browser version, extension version, operating
  system and your IP address, is transmitted during an update check. Element Hiding Helper nightly
  build updates are handled by the AdblockPlus.org website and the
  data transmitted is subject to its privacy policy. Updates to stable
  releases are handled by the Addons.Mozilla.Org website and are subject
  to the Firefox Privacy
  Policy.

Email collection

  Some of our webpages host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile
  device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email).
  Further, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch).
  In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).
  We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.
