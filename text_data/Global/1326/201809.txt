Kalmbach Media Privacy Policy
Kalmbach Media (“Kalmbach”) is committed to providing service that exceeds expectations. This includes maintaining your privacy when it comes to the collection and use of any personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) you may provide us via the Internet or otherwise. We believe it is important to explain our information gathering practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
This Privacy Policy (or “Policy”) addresses information that Kalmbach collects from you, both via the Internet or through other methods, and begins by answering the following questions:

Who is Kalmbach?
What types of Personal Data does Kalmbach collect?
Does Kalmbach share Personal Data?
How does Kalmbach use your Personal Data?
What are your rights regarding your Personal Data?
How can you exercise your rights?

After answering these initial questions, this policy then addresses a number of other issues related to privacy. We suggest that you read this Policy in full before providing information to Kalmbach or visiting Kalmbach’s websites, and that you regularly check our Policy to determine if there have been any material changes that would affect your decision on whether to continue using Kalmbach’s websites. Please note that this Policy is written in English. Kalmbach does not guarantee the accuracy of any translated versions of this Policy. To the extent any translated version of this Policy conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.
Any Personal Data that we collect from you is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the new Policy online or by sending you an email or other notification as required by applicable law. The effective date of those changes will be posted at the top of this Privacy Policy.

What types of Personal Data does Kalmbach collect?
Personal data is collected by Kalmbach when you decide to place an order (personally or as gifts for others), register on our websites or for our newsletters, enter a contest, participate in a survey, or make a general inquiry. The information collected when you order from us or enter a contest could include the following: name, address, phone / fax number, email address, and credit card information. With regard to credit card information, we employ the Internet’s strongest encryption tools and technology, allowing your transaction to be instantaneous, while as secure as possible from unauthorized access or misuse. We also may collect certain information automatically as you use our websites, such as your Internet Protocol address, browser type, computer type, operating system version, type of mobile device (if used), location data (if available), the website from which you navigated to our website, the time and date associated with your use of our website, the pages on our website that you view and how long you view each page, as well as other miscellaneous information about you.
To enhance your online experience, we use “cookies.” Cookies are text files we place in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Once you choose to furnish the site with Personal Data, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie, and to personalize your experience on our websites.
We use cookies to understand Internet usage and to improve our content, offerings, and advertisements. Kalmbach will use cookies, pixel trackers, server logs and other Internet technologies to measure the effectiveness of our website content.
We may have enabled Demographic & Interest reporting via Google Analytics Advertising Features for some of our websites. This information is used to better understand how website visitors are interacting with our websites. This information is not used to personally identify any website visitors. Visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics Advertiser Features through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI’s consumer opt-out). Google also provides a listing of currently available opt-outs for the web, here.
We also may use small pieces of code called “web beacons” or “clear gifs” to collect anonymous and aggregate advertising metrics, such as counting page views, promotion views, or advertising responses. We are not responsible for and do not control cookies placed in third party ads or any actions or policies of any third party advertising technology service providers or of any third party members of any related advertising networks.

Does Kalmbach share my Personal Data?
Kalmbach reserves the right to disclose your Personal Data as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on Kalmbach. We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to Kalmbach, our websites, or our customers. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.
Additionally, if the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the websites to a third party, we may transfer your personal information to the new owner to be used consistent with this Policy.
Kalmbach may also engage certain trusted third party companies and individuals to facilitate the websites on Kalmbach’s behalf, to perform services (e.g., without limitation, hosting and maintenance services, customer relationship services, web analytics, payment processing and database storage and management services). We may share your Personal Data with these third parties to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services.
Kalmbach may also provide your information to other reputable companies or organizations for marketing or information gathering purposes. Typically, such third parties serve the hobby or leisure-time industries in one form or another. You may request to be excluded from such mailings by contacting the Privacy Office as indicated at the end of this policy.
Kalmbach does not rent, trade, or sell your Personal Data to third-party organizations.

How does Kalmbach use my Personal Data?
We use your information primarily to respond to you and to fulfill your needs as a customer or prospective customer. We use your information to send you the magazines, books or other products you have ordered, to send you newsletters or welcome messages, to process your payment, to fulfill your request to enter a contest, to recognize you as a repeat visitor to our websites, to acknowledge your interest in participating in a survey, or to resolve a customer service matter or other inquiry you have brought to our attention.
Information volunteered by you in any message or postings on Kalmbach-provided forums, discussion/bulletin boards, club membership sites, event calendars, or the like, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any such posted message.
If you subscribe to one or more of our magazines, you will also receive a notice or notices about renewing your subscription prior to its expiration date. You may request to be excluded from such renewal mailings per the procedure set forth later in this Policy. You may also receive periodic mailings from us about new products, services or upcoming events, and — from time-to-time — as mentioned earlier in the Policy, your information may be made available to other reputable companies or organizations for marketing or information gathering purposes. Typically, such third parties serve the hobby and/or leisure-time industries in one form or another. You may again request to be excluded from such mailings by contacting us directly or by taking other proactive measures, as specified below.

What are my rights regarding my Personal Data?
We believe it is important for you to understand your rights and be able to control the Personal Data you provide. Please note the following rights you have regarding your Personal Data.

You have the right to be informed about what Personal Data we collect and how we use it.
You have the right to obtain a copy of your Personal Data.
You have the right to correct Personal Data that is incorrect or complete your Personal Data if it is incomplete.
You have the right to have your Personal Data deleted from our systems in certain circumstances.
You have the right to object to the processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.
You have the right to restrict processing of your Personal Data in certain circumstances.
You have the right to obtain or reuse any Personal Data that you provide.


How can I exercise my rights with respect to my Personal Data?
To ask a question or exercise any of your rights listed above, please contact Kalmbach’s Privacy Office as indicated at the end of this policy.
In addition, at the time you volunteer Personal Data and at any time thereafter, you can direct us not to use this information for promotional or informational mailings. At your option, you may also elect to suppress the mailing of renewal notices for any of our magazines. If you do so, your Personal Data will be flagged in our system as “do not promote” to correspond with your request, and you will be excluded from the related Kalmbach mailings. You can also elect separately to be excluded from mailings by any third party to whom your address might otherwise be provided.
You can, at any time, send such directions to our Privacy Office at Kalmbach Media, P.O. Box 1612, Waukesha WI 53187-1612, or simply contact us at privacy@kalmbach.com.
If you wish to review or request any changes to information that is stored by Kalmbach, please contact us at privacy@kalmbach.com.
There are also national clearinghouse organizations and governmental entities where you can register to suppress unwanted solicitations. The most prominent of these is the Direct Marketing Association (DMA). The DMA provides mail, email and telephone database “preference services” free of charge to consumers who wish to block all unsolicited direct mail, e-mail and telemarketing contacts, respectively. For more information, visit DMA’s website at https://thedma.org/resources/consumer-resources, or contact them at (212)768-7277.
In addition to the special measures you may take to suppress unwanted solicitations by contacting us directly, Kalmbach has implemented procedures whereby files that otherwise would be used for promotional mailings are processed with the DMA to remove any records belonging to individuals who may have registered with DMA’s Mail Preference Service (but not with Kalmbach).
As yet a further safeguard, many third parties to whom Kalmbach may provide Personal Data take the additional step to suppress the solicitation of anyone who has just recently registered with the appropriate DMA preference services, by doing so just prior to their mailing dates. Although Kalmbach uses reasonable good faith efforts to require third parties to regularly follow this practice, we cannot, of course, guarantee that they adhere to our expectations.

Surveys and Sweepstakes
With regard to surveys in which you elect to participate, we may request demographic information (age, family income level, etc.) along with basic information regarding your reading or hobby interests and how Kalmbach may better serve those needs. Finally, name, address and other contact information may be collected so that we can respond to any customer service issue, request for information or other general inquiry, along with information about the nature of your inquiry.
Demographic and other information volunteered in connection with surveys is used primarily for internal purposes to improve the company’s responsiveness to customers’ wants, needs, interests, opinions and suggestions. On occasion, the aggregate findings and results of such surveys may be published as a matter of interest to the hobbyists/respondents who provided the information, or for the benefit of trade associations or others who may occasionally sponsor such surveys.

Our Policy With Respect to Children Under 13
Kalmbach’s websites are not directed to children under 13. Kalmbach does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Data without parental consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@kalmbach.com. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with Personal Data without verifiable parental consent, we will delete such information from our files.
