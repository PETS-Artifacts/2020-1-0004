Ariat is committed to respecting the privacy and security of your personal information. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and provide you with an online browsing and shopping experience. The following privacy policy further describes the information we collect, and how we use and protect your personal information. By using this website, you consent to this privacy policy, and the collection and use of the information you provide to Ariat as set forth herein. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post any new terms on this page so that you can always be aware of any changes in how we collect, use and protect your personal information.
This site collects no personally identifying information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide it. In connection with your use of this site and/or your online shopping experience with Ariat, we need to know certain information like your name, e-mail address, mailing or shipping address, credit card number, and date and expiration, etc. This allows us to process and fulfill your order. Similarly, we collect email addresses and information volunteered by visitors such as product registration, contest entries and survey information. We use this information not only for the basic functionality of your online browsing and shopping, but we may also use it to monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to improve our site design, and thus improve your experience. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about changes to our web site or to send you mailings or e-mails with information on new products or upcoming events, or special offers we think you might find valuable. Affiliates or partners of ours may also use this information to do the same.
When you register, you have the discretion whether or not to submit certain information such as telephone number, personal address, gender and purchase criteria. As mentioned above, this type of information helps us to understand our visitors and tailor products and promotions around your needs. For instance, address and telephone information assist us in contacting winning entrants for any of our contest promotions.
As a visitor to our site, you can always select whether or not you would like to be on Ariat's email list. Visitors who choose to be on Ariat's email list and later decide they would not like to receive information may unsubscribe by replying to any email and typing UNSUBSCRIBE.
