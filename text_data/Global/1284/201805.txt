Below you'll find information describing our most common uses of cookies, which are an inherent part of our production, communication and distribution processes and have enabled us to better serve you.What's a cookie? A cookie is a small file that is sent to your computer by a site's server. A cookie can be a record of your visit to a site, including information such as your User Name, registration information, time of last visit, pages viewed, etc. Cookies created by the servers of one site can be retrieved only by that site’s servers. Thus, information in Stratfor cookies is not accessible to other sites.Why do you use cookies? We use cookies to allow you to move quickly through our site. We accomplish this in many ways, using several different cookies. When you first enter www.stratfor.com, for example, we may use a test cookie to confirm your browser's ability to retain cookies. Other cookies that you might receive during your sessions are from Stratfor or our third-party service providers or third-party network advertisers. These network advertisers may use their own cookies in order to serve ads on our Web sites, ensuring you won't see the same ads over and over again.So, what's in it for me? Here's a quick rundown of what we see as the biggest advantages of cookies:Faster, more convenient access. We can deliver to you customized information and store your settings more efficiently. Better information. We want to give you features and services in which you're interested. Through the use of cookies, we can determine which features are most popular with subscribers on an aggregate basis and thus better serve your needs by developing new features and services in response to our analysis of subscribers' usage. More efficient ad processing. Cookies enable us to streamline our ad presentations. Will the cookies you send me go away? Some of our cookies are long term. Some cookies do expire after a short period of time. Remember, cookies are small files (just a few hundred bytes) and won't pose any significant disk-space concerns. You are, of course, free to clear cookies from your device any time you wish.Should I set my browser to not accept cookies or to alert me each time I receive one? You certainly could set your browser to alert you each time a cookie is passed to your machine. However, we'd recommend that you turn that feature off, perhaps after using the site for a day or so with it on, once you've seen firsthand how we use this technology. Our use of cookies ultimately helps you have a better experience here. You might find it cumbersome to be alerted to each cookie you'll encounter.
