Austrade works closely with state and territory governments to attract and facilitate productive foreign direct investment into Australia

However, it may be impracticable for us to deal with you in that way in other circumstances or we may be required or authorised by law to know your identity in order to perform our functions. For example, to provide you with information relevant to your business or to provide you with consular services, we may need to know your identity.
How does Austrade collect personal information?

Austrade generally collects your personal information directly from you. Â However, in some circumstances we collect personal information about you from someone else such as where you have authorised us to do so, where the information is on a publicly available source (eg by way of a company search), where it is necessary for a consular function or where it is unreasonable or impracticable to collect the information from you such as in the case of a medical opinion.
We may collect your personal information in a variety of ways including by phone, in writing, via our website when you provide information on online forms or through signing-up to a subscription.
How does Austrade use and disclose personal information?
