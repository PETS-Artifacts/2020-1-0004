              information about your health, race, ethnic origin and religious beliefs.

              understand how their information will be handled.
Information we collect automatically
Whenever you visit or interact with a Toyota Group website or other online platform of ours
              (“Platforms”), we, as well as any third-party service provider and/or advertiser, may
              use a variety of technologies that automatically or passively record information about how the Platform is accessed
              and used (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include your IP address or other
              unique identifier for the device used to access a Platform ("Device Identifier"), browser
              type, “Device” type (computer, mobile phone, tablet or other device), operation system,
              application version, date and time of visit, pages viewed, preceding page views and your use of features or
              applications on the Platform such as interactions with connections or groups.
Usage Information helps us keep our Platforms relevant to users and allows us to tailor content to a user’s
              interests. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and
              identifiable person, we will treat it as personal information.
We may use Device Identifiers to help us administer Platforms, diagnose problems with our servers, analyze trends,
              observe Platform usage and activity over time, help identify you and your shopping cart, and gather broad
              demographic information for aggregate use.
Cookies (data files placed on a Device when it is used to visit a Platform) may be used to associate
              you with social media platforms like Facebook and, if you so choose, enable interaction between your activities on
              our Platforms and those social media platforms. We or our vendors may place cookies on your Device for security
              purposes, to facilitate site navigation and personalise your experience while visiting our Platforms (such as
              allowing us to select which ads or offers are most likely to appeal to you, based on your interests, preferences,
              location or demographic information).
To learn how you may manage cookies, or delete cookies that have already been installed, please refer to your browser’s
              help menu or instructions. If you disable or opt out of receiving cookies, some features and functions on our
              Platforms may not work properly or fully because we may not be able to recognise and associate you with your Toyota
              account(s). In addition, the offers we provide may not be as relevant to you or tailored to your interests.
Remarketing: We use Google Adwords Remarketing to advertise our products and services online. Third
              party vendors, including Google, use cookies to display relevant ads based on your past visits to our website(s).
              Google Remarketing allows us to tailor our marketing to better suit your needs and display ads that are relevant to
              you. We respect your privacy and any data collected will be used in accordance with this privacy policy, Google's
              privacy policy or the privacy policy of other remarketing services that we may use.
If you do not wish to participate in our Google Adwords Remarketing, you can opt out by visiting Google's Ads
              Preference Manager (myaccount.google.com/u/0/privacy?pli=1#ads). You can also opt
              out of any third party vendor's use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page www.networkadvertising.org

6.    Direct marketing
The OneToyota Network (or any of the entities which make up the OneToyota Network including their agents and
              contractors if any acting on their behalf) may send you direct marketing to inform you about products or services,
              special offers, promotions and events that may be of interest to you. These marketing communications may include
              joint promotions with Toyota dealers or other promotion partners, and may be sent to you using any contact details
              provided by you, such as post, phone, email or SMS.
Please note that the organisations comprising the OneToyota Network are separate organisations. If you do not wish to
              receive marketing communications and surveys from a member of the Network, you can let that organisation know at any
              time using the contact details in their respective privacy policies or utilising the “unsubscribe” or
              other opt-out function offered by the organisation.
If you do not wish to receive any marketing communications from Toyota Australia or Toyota Finance, you can let the
              relevant organisation know using the contact details provided in section 13 “Contacting us” below, or by
              utilising the “unsubscribe” function in electronic communications from the organisation. In some
              circumstances we may need to contact you to obtain additional information, verify your identity or to clarify your
              request, in order to action it.
Your consent to receive direct marketing communications from the OneToyota Network in the above ways will be deemed
              if you do not opt out when you are offered the opportunity to do so, and will remain current on an ongoing basis
              unless and until you advise otherwise.
If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products or services (for example, product recalls),
              we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive information about our products and services
              generally.
7.    Who do we disclose your information to?
We may share your information within the OneToyota Network in order to provide an integrated OneToyota guest
              experience across our Network.
Your vehicle logbook data, and service and repair history (including in relation to warranty and recalls, if
              applicable) may be made available to subsequent owners (if any) of your vehicle. We do not disclose any personally
              identifying information about you to subsequent owners of your vehicle.
We may disclose your information to others including:

the Toyota Group’s related bodies corporate (including our parent company Toyota Motor Corporation in
                  Japan);

                  authorities; or
              
your employer or former employer (for example, to conduct a reference check for potential employment or finance

8.    Credit reporting (applies only if you seek finance from Toyota Finance)
In this section, references to “we”, “us” or “our” refer to Toyota Finance only,
              not Toyota Australia. Toyota Finance participates in the comprehensive credit reporting system to make better and
              more informed decisions about providing credit to our customers. When you apply for credit with Toyota Finance, or
              propose to be a guarantor, we may request a credit report about you from a CRB. Credit reports contain information
              about your credit history that will help us assess your credit worthiness and your ability to repay credit.
What credit information and credit eligibility information do we collect and hold?
The credit information we collect and hold includes your identification details, the type of credit you hold, the
              amount of credit borrowed, the terms and conditions of your credit, when your credit was opened or closed, whether
              or not you have met your repayment obligations under your loan contract and loan contracts with other credit
              providers, and information about your credit worthiness. The credit eligibility information we collect and hold
              includes credit reports obtained from a CRB and our own rating or score which help us to assess your
              creditworthiness.
What do we do with credit information and credit eligibility information? 
We collect, hold, use and disclose credit information and credit eligibility information about you for purposes which
              include:

confirming your identity;
assessing your consumer or commercial credit or guarantor application;
managing your account and collecting any overdue payments;
helping you avoid defaulting on your loan;
complying with any relevant laws and regulations.

We will use the information obtained from a CRB, and combine it with information we already hold about you, to
              calculate our own rating or score to help us assess your creditworthiness.
We may also disclose to the CRB if you have not met the payment obligations under your loan contract or if you have
              committed a serious credit infringement (for example fraud). Some of the information we disclose to a CRB may be
              included in your credit report and provided to other credit providers to help them assess your creditworthiness.
We may disclose your information to any of the following CRBs:

Dun and Bradstreet - dnb.com.au -
                  1300 734 806
Experian - experian.com.au -
                  1300 784 134
Veda - veda.com.au

If you would like to know how these organisations manage your information, you can view their privacy policies on
              their websites or contact them directly by calling the numbers above.
What are your rights?
You have the right to ask a CRB not to use your information for the purpose of pre-screening or direct marketing by a
              credit provider. You can ask them not to use or disclose this information for a period of time if you reasonably
              believe that you have been, or are likely to be, a victim of fraud.
9.   Holding and protecting your information
We may hold information about you in digital and paper forms. We take reasonable steps to protect your information
              from misuse, loss, interference, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. Some of the ways we
              protect your information include:

external and internal premises security;
restricting access to your information only to personnel who need it to perform their functions;
utilising and maintaining information security applications to prevent unauthorised access or damage to
                  electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus
                  software; and
              
maintaining physical security over paper records.

10.    Disclosing your information overseas
We may disclose your information to organisations located overseas. These include:

our related companies in Japan and elsewhere in the world; or
our service providers that are located or hold data overseas including in the USA, Singapore, the UK and
                  Sweden.
              

11.    Accessing and correcting your information
You can generally access and request the correction of information we hold about you by contacting us in any of the
              ways set out at the bottom of this policy. Please note that the organisations comprising the OneToyota Network (that
              is, each of Toyota Australia, Toyota Finance, each Toyota dealer, Toyota Insurance
              and Toyota Western Australia) are separate organisations, and each organisation may hold different information about
              you (if any).
          
We may charge an access fee to recover the reasonable costs incurred. This charge is only designed to help us
              reasonably recover the costs associated with providing you with access and does not apply to the making of the
              request. Before we act on a request, we will provide an estimate of the access fee and ask you to agree to it.
Access to your information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to
              anticipated legal proceedings or if the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny or restrict your
              access, we will write to you to let you know why, unless, having regard to the grounds for the refusal, it would be
              unreasonable for us to do so. You may make a complaint about a refusal to the Office of the Australian Information
              Commissioner.
We rely on the information that we hold about you to provide our products and services to you, and to perform our
              business functions. Therefore, it is very important that the information we hold is accurate, complete, up to date
              and relevant. This means that, from time to time, we may ask you if your information is still accurate and up to
              date. If you find that any information that we hold about you is incorrect, you should contact us immediately and we
              will take reasonable steps to correct it.
12.    Resolving concerns
If you believe that your privacy has been compromised, or if you feel that we have breached the privacy laws, you are
              entitled to make a complaint. Complaints can be made by contacting the person or department you were dealing with,
              or by contacting us using our contact details set out at the bottom of this policy.
We endeavour to respond to you within 24 hours to acknowledge the complaint and explain how we will investigate it.
              This may include consulting with the CRB or other credit providers if the complaint relates to your credit
              information. We will try to resolve your complaint within 20 working days and write to you to explain the reasons
              for our decision. When this is not possible, we will contact you and let you know how long it will take for us to
              resolve your complaint.
If your complaint is not satisfactorily resolved, you can contact us to discuss your concerns or lodge a complaint
              with Office of the Australian Information Commissioner by visiting oaic.gov.au,
              calling 1300 363 992 or emailing enquiries@oaic.gov.au.
              If your complaint relates to your finance with us you may access the Financial Ombudsman Service at fos.org.au or by calling

The kinds of personal information that we collect and hold about you will depend on the circumstances of collection, including whether we collect the information from you as a customer, Toyota dealer, supplier, contractor, stakeholder, job applicant, or in some other capacity.
We will only collect sensitive information about you with your consent (unless we are otherwise allowed or required by law to collect that information). Sensitive information includes information about your health, race, ethnic origin and religious beliefs.
If we are not able to collect your personal information, we may not be able to provide you with our products or services or do business with you or the organisation with which you are connected.
If you provide us with personal information about another person (such as a joint vehicle owner), please make sure that you tell them about this privacy policy.
4.    Why personal information is collected by the company
The Company collects personal information for a range of purposes relating to the products and services it offers. Those purposes include but are not limited to:

responding to enquiries regarding vehicles and vehicle sales, products and accessories and services we offer;
receiving feedback and dealing with complaints;
processing orders and administering accounts;
providing customer and Toyota dealer support;
considering job applicants for current and future employment;
vehicle warranties and product recalls;
marketing and promotional activities;
product development and market research; and
meeting our regulatory and legal obligations.

We may also use your information for other purposes required or authorised by or under law (including purposes for which you have provided your consent).
5.    How does the company collect personal information
Where possible, the Company will collect your personal information directly from you. This may take place in a number of ways, such as when you interact with us in writing (including if you give us a written order), or ask us to provide a product or service or otherwise deal with us over the telephone or internet.
We may obtain personal information from third parties such as our Toyota dealer network, Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited, contractors, service providers and regulatory authorities.
Regardless to who provides personal information to us, it will always be handled by the Company in accordance with this Privacy Policy and the Australian Privacy Principles.
6.    Do we disclose personal information to anyone else
In conducting our activities, we may sometimes need to disclose your personal information to others. Examples of the types of organisations we may need to disclose information to include but are not limited to:

related bodies corporate;
Toyota Dealers;
Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Ltd;
parts suppliers;
insurers and financiers; and
a person or organisation outside Perron Group who is contracted to us to provide a particular service on our behalf.

Examples of organisations with which we contract include but are not limited to:

information technology service providers; and
accountants, lawyers and other service providers

Contracted parties are not authorised by us to use personal information provided to them for anything other than the purpose for which they are contracted.
Toyota Motor Corporation Ltd has offices located overseas and as a result, personal information collected and held by the Company may be transferred to those overseas offices.
Sometimes the law requires us to disclose personal information. For example, information may be disclosed to a court in response to a subpoena or to a Government agency such as a vehicle licensing authority. We also disclose driver and vehicle information to the National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS).
We may also disclose your personal information to other third parties and for other purposes with your consent. That consent may be written, verbal or implied from your conduct.
The Company does not disclose personal information to its related entities, Toyota dealer network, service providers or other associated organisations for the purposes of direct marketing their services or products. However, we may join the Toyota dealer network, service providers and other associated organisations in joint marketing of our respective products and services to customers.
If the law requires us to provide you with information about our products and services, we will provide that information even if you have elected not to receive such information.
7.    Ensuring personal information is up to date
We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we hold is accurate, complete, up to date and relevant whenever we collect or use it. This means that from time to time we will ask you to tell us if there are any changes to your personal information. If you find that information we hold about you is incorrect, please contact us immediately and we will take reasonable steps to correct it.
8.    Security of personal information
We may store your information in hardcopy and/or in electronic form. Security of personal information is important to us and we take reasonable precautions to protect personal information from misuse, interference and loss, and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.
Some of the ways we protect personal information include:



external and internal premises security;
restricting access to personal information only to staff who need it to perform their day to day functions;
maintaining technology products to prevent unauthorised computer access or damage to electronically stored information, such as requiring identifiers and passwords, firewalls and anti-virus software; and
maintaining physical security over paper records



9.    Access to personal information by individuals
You can access most of the personal information we hold about you by contacting us by any of the means set out below and we will generally provide you with access subject to some exceptions permitted by law.
We may charge an access fee to cover the reasonable cost of retrieving the information and supplying it to you.
Access to personal information may be refused in a number of circumstances, such as where the information relates to anticipated legal proceedings or the request for access is frivolous or vexatious. If we deny of restrict your access, we will explain why.
10.    If you send us an email
If you send us an email containing personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of that information. The content of emails is sometimes monitored by our Internet host for maintenance and fault detection purposes. We may also monitor email for legal compliance purposes. Emails may also be sent to our Toyota dealer network, service providers or contractors when they relate to product or service enquires or complaints.
Although we take steps to protect information sent by email, email is not a secure method of communication and if you are concerned about sending your personal information to us in this manner you may prefer to contact us by any of the other means set out below.
11.    Resolving concerns
If you have any concerns or complaints about the manner in which we have collected or handled your personal information, please let us know. You can make a complaint by contacting the person or department you were dealing with. We will investigate your complaint and respond to you in writing within 30 days. If you are not satisfied with our response, you can contact us to discuss your concerns or lodge a complaint with the Australian Information Commissioner (www.oaic.gov.au).
12.    Contacting us

Aioi Nissay Dowa Insurance Co., Ltd. ABN 39 096 302 466 (Andia).

About Toyota Insurance
Toyota Insurance was underwritten by Andia up until 31 December 2013. However, due to an internal re-organisation,
              Adica will be the new Australian operated and regulated insurer of all Toyota Insurance products from 1 January 2014. As both Andia and Adica collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information, this privacy policy relates to both of them.
About Adica and Andia
Adica and Andia are members of MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc., which also includes Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance
              Co., Ltd. MS&AD Insurance Group Holdings Inc. is one of Japan’s largest non-life insurance companies, with
              a worldwide network providing diversified insurance services through subsidiaries and branches in key cities in
              Asia, Australia, North America and Europe.
By combining our core expertise with the strength and resonance of the Toyota Group of Companies, we are uniquely
              placed to provide a niche suite of financial products and services. Adica and Andia are APRA regulated general
              insurers and Australian Financial Services Licence (AFSL) holders.
Our commitment to the protection of your personal information
This privacy policy sets out the way we collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information including, where
              relevant, your sensitive information such as your health information or criminal record.
By visiting any of our websites, applying for, renewing or using any of our products or services, or providing us
              with your personal information, you consent to your personal information being collected, held, used for the
              purposes and disclosed as set out in this privacy policy.
You do not have to provide us with your personal information. However, if you do not provide us with the information
              we request, we may not be able to assist you or provide you with our products or services.
What personal information do we collect?
We collect personal information necessary for us to provide you with the assistance, products and/or services you
              have requested, or to manage the claims made by you or against you. Such personal information includes your name,
              address and other contact details, age, gender, occupation, insurance profile, driving record and details of
              insurance policies you hold.
We will only collect, hold, use or disclose sensitive information (including health information or past criminal
              convictions) about you for the purposes noted in this privacy policy, with your consent or if required by law and if the information is necessary to provide you with cover or process a claim under any of our products.
How do we collect personal information?
We collect your personal information in various ways, such as over the phone, in one of the Toyota Dealers’
              premises, in one of our offices or over the internet if you transact with us online or via one of our
              partners – Toyota Finance Australia Limited, Toyota Motor Corporation Australia Limited or a Toyota Dealer
              (collectively the “Toyota Family”).
Whenever possible, we collect your personal information directly from you. However, we may collect personal
              information about you from someone else. For example, from our intermediaries, including intermediaries in the
              Toyota network (if you apply for, receive or acquire a Toyota Insurance product or service via them), other insurers, medical practitioners, assessors, repairers, your employer, another party involved in a claim or your family members.
Please note that our intermediaries may (but only with your consent) obtain a credit report about you from a credit agency for the purpose of a loan application assessment or to obtain financial details from your accountant and may provide a copy of this report to us.
Irrespective of the source, we respect and value your personal information and will deal with it in the manner set out in this privacy policy.
We may also request for you to provide us with personal information about someone else, such as a co-insured person
              or a witness to an accident that is the subject of a claim. Before providing us with such information, you must tell
              the person that you will be providing personal information about them to us and that their information
will be handled in accordance with this privacy policy. You must also provide them with a copy of (or refer them to
              where they can obtain a copy of) this privacy policy. If you provide us with the personal information of another
              person, you warrant that you have that person’s consent to do so.
How do we use your personal information?
We collect your personal information for the purposes for which it was provided to us, other related purposes or as
              authorised or required by law. These purposes include:

communicating with you, providing you with the assistance, products and/or services you have requested and
                  processing any payments;
              
setting premiums appropriately and compiling statistics;
managing, assessing and paying claims;
conducting market research to better understand the needs of our customers;
enabling any of the Toyota Family to conduct their own market research to better understand the needs of Toyota
                  customers;
              
providing you with marketing material and keeping you informed of special offers, new products or services of ours or any of the Toyota Family that we believe you may be interested in (“Toyota Marketing”) (if you have consented to receiving such); and
any other purposes specified at the time of collecting your personal information.

We will only use your sensitive information (such as health information or criminal record) for the purposes for
              which it was initially collected, the purposes listed in this privacy policy, other directly-related purposes or
              purposes to which you otherwise consent.
If at any time you do not wish to receive Toyota Marketing from us or any of the Toyota Family, you may contact us by
              calling 137 200 or follow the unsubscribe instructions on any Toyota Marketing. You can elect to receive or cease receiving Toyota Marketing at
              any time by simply calling that number or following the instructions on any Toyota Marketing.
How do we disclose your personal information?
Where appropriate, we may disclose your personal information to any of the Toyota Family and other third parties who
              provide
services to us or on our behalf for purposes such as processing a claim, validating and confirming information,
              administering policies and where customer research is conducted and/or such other purposes as noted below. The types
              of entities to which and purposes for which we may disclose your personal information include:

related entities ( for the management of your policy or if they take over any of our functions or activities as a result of a restructure or otherwise);
other insurance companies (such as the life insurers of our finance protection insurance policies) and re-insurers (for example, to confirm your insurance profile);
the Toyota Family (including our intermediaries throughout the Toyota network and/or an appointed representative
                  to provide or facilitate the provision of our or their services to you);
              
our third party Information Technology (IT) and other service providers (such as our mailing house or our
                  lawyers);
              
any of the Toyota Family in order for them to provide you with Toyota Marketing (if you have consented to
                  receiving it);
              
your employer;
claims/loss assessors, loss adjusters, investigators and recovery agents (for example, when a claim requires
                  assessment or investigation);
              
repairers, suppliers, medical practitioners, rehabilitation providers and case managers;
insurance reference bureaus, data collection and verification agencies and consumer research organisations;
the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) (this is an external dispute resolution scheme);
a guarantor noted on a finance contract and finance companies (such as Toyota Finance); and
government authorities, law enforcement agencies and credit enforcement bodies and agencies (if permitted or required by law).

Some of the entities listed above are located in countries outside of Australia (such as Japan). We will only disclose your sensitive information (such as health information or criminal record) for the purposes for which it was initially collected, the purposes set out in this policy, other directly-related purposes, as permitted by law or purposes to which you otherwise consent.
Security of your personal information
We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information against loss, misuse, interference and unauthorised
              access, alteration or disclosure. For example, access to the personal information that we store on our systems is
              subject to the use of secure passwords and identifiers. We also implement reasonable physical security measures.
However, no security measure is completely secure and, despite the procedures we have put in place, we cannot
              guarantee the security of your personal information (particularly in relation to transmissions over the
              internet).
Any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk. You must also make sure you protect your
              personal information, for example, by protecting your usernames, passwords and policy details.
You should notify us as soon as you become aware of any such security breaches.
How to access and correct your personal information
We take reasonable steps to ensure the personal information we collect and hold is accurate, complete and up-to-date.
              However, we rely on you to advise us about any changes to your personal information to help us maintain accurate, complete and
              up-to-date information. Please let us know if you think any information we hold about you is not accurate, complete
              or up-to-date.
On request, we will provide you with access to your personal information that we hold (unless otherwise required or
              permitted by applicable law). We will notify you of the basis for any denial to access your information.
In most cases, a summary of basic policy information such as your name, address, contact details, policy details or
              copies of documents such as repair quotations can be requested by phone and will be sent to you.
Although some requests can be made by telephone, for others (such as a relevant assessor’s or investigator’s
              report) we may need you to complete a written application.
Please contact us on 137 200 if you would like information on how to request access to such information.
There is no charge for making a request.
If you have a complaint relating to privacy
If you believe we may have compromised your privacy or breached the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) or its privacy principles,
              you can call Toyota Insurance on 137 200, or email or write to us. Our contact details are provided on the next
              page.
You will need to provide us with details of your complaint and any supporting evidence and/or information. You will
              receive an acknowledgement from us no later than five business days after receipt of your written complaint.
We will refer your complaint to our Internal Dispute Resolution Department (IDR) and will appoint an IDR specialist
              to investigate your complaint and determine the steps (if any) that we will undertake to resolve your complaint.
We will contact you if we require any additional information from you. You will be sent the final decision of our IDR
              specialist in writing no later than 15 business days after you contact us, if we have all the necessary information to make that decision.
