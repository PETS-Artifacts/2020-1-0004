Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. Kids under 13 are not allowed to register with our website or to post on our site. We won’t knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide us any personally identifying information.Information we do and don’t collectThe information we gather on our site falls into two categories:* Personally identifying information (such as your name, mailing address and email address) you supply when you initiate transactions, register to receive catalogs or newsletters, or use our bulletin boards if or when we have them; and* Completely anonymous tracking information we collect as you navigate through our site.Additionally, third-party providers featured on or linked to by our website — such as vendors of products and services offered through our site — may gather the same kinds of information.How we use the information we collectWe use the personally identifiable information you provide about yourself to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services; to respond to your inquiries; to send you e-mail newsletters you have requested; and to offer you other products or services that we believe may be of interest to you– but only if you opt to receive this information.In general, it is our policy not to share your e-mail address or any phone numbers you may provide us with any third-party organizations. We do not share our e-mail mailing list with third parties.Please note, however, that our site also may include links to other websites, and we provide access to products and services offered by third parties. We share with these third parties such information as is necessary to provide the products or services. We will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it’s necessary to provide services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion. For example, we will provide your name and e-mail address to a marketing partner from which you’re purchasing goods or services, or from which you are requesting a catalog.We also provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don’t control. The privacy policies of these third party sites may differ from ours.

Occasionally we also invite our users to anonymously share certain personal information about themselves — such as their age, income levels, hobbies and the like. In both cases, we aggregate this information and use it to gain a better understanding of our users’ interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. We also share this aggregate information with advertisers, to help them gain a better understanding of the demographics of our audience.Users also should be aware when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on HomeTips bulletin boards, comments, postings, or forums, that this information can be collected and used by third parties.
