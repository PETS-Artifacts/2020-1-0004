We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. We will also use this information to notify you when your order has been shipped and to contact you if we have trouble processing your order.

Email to a friend:
If you choose to use our 'email to a friend' service to tell a friend about a book you found on Biblio.com, we will ask you for your friends name and email address.

Agents:

We do not sell, rent or share your Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties unless we have your prior consent to do so.
