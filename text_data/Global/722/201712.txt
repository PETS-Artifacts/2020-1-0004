Information we collect via the BV website and social media/eUpdate channels
If you choose to engage with any of the services provided on our website we collect information in two ways:

Information you provide.  (Personal Information) -  For example, you may have signed up to a Business Victoria Account to use some of our services and we ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number. If you want to join our social media communities, we have access to your publicly visible details, which may include your name and photo; and
Information we get from your interaction with our services. (Aggregated information -  collected in an anonymous form) -  For example, we may identify the type of device you use to access our services, age, gender and interests through third-party vendors such as Google Analytics.


If you access social media/eUpdate channels such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and the Small Business Victoria eUpdate, you should be aware that any information you post onto such media is available for the public to see.  You should therefore check your individual privacy settings for profiles and accounts on social media networks and their privacy policies. BV strongly recommends that you regularly check and configure the privacy settings for your profiles and accounts to make sure that you know what information you are making available, and to which audience.
Data Quality and Security
While BV takes reasonable precautions to protect the information it holds from unauthorised use, the nature of the information systems is such that the security of information cannot be guaranteed. BV relies on commercially available technologies for the security of its information systems - this applies not only to BV but to the use of online information security systems in general.

BV relies on the information that users provide and it is the users' responsibility to ensure that information they submit is accurate. Users are prohibited from posing as someone else. BV will deactivate accounts and delete information in these circumstances.

BV and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party “cookies” (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together  to retrieve statistics on how our visitors use the BV website, social media/eUpdate channels and other internet services provided, how long you are on those channels, how you got there etc.. Google Analytics cookies do not collect personal identifiable information about your visits to the website. They do however collect other non-personal information including your IP address which is transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. This information will help us understand and better meet our audience’s needs.
