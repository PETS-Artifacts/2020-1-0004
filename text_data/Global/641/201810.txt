POLICY STATEMENT
This policy describes Chapman University's data protection strategy to comply with multiple regulations, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation ("EU GDPR").
REASON FOR THE POLICY
In order for Chapman to educate its international and domestic students, engage in world-class research, and provide community services, it is essential and necessary, and Chapman has a lawful basis, to collect, process, use, and/or maintain the personal data of its students, employees, applicants, research subjects, and others involved in its educational, research, and community programs.  These activities include, without limitation, admission, registration, delivery of classroom and study abroad education, grades, communications, employment, applied research, development, program analysis for improvements, and records retention.
The EU GDPR imposes obligations on entities, like Chapman, that collect or process personal data about people in the European Union ("EU").  The EU GDPR applies to personal data collected or processed about anyone located in the EU, regardless of whether they are a citizen or permanent resident of an EU country.
