In common with many sites we use outside providers for website statistics.

The primary provider we use is Google Analytics. You can find further information on the data it collects at https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-GB
The above information is collected on the basis that it is necessary to provide our services to you, or that, through posting, you consent to the collection of the information you provide.

Anonymous and aggregated data
Boards.ie Limited may aggregate data in an anonymous manner for disclosure to advertisers or business associates for promotion and marketing purposes.
