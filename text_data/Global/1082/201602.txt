You are solely responsible for guarding the secrecy of your username and its related password. We encourage you to change your password frequently. Although by diligence and care you may reduce the risk of unauthorized use of your username and password, such risk may not be eliminated. Again, we are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Website; if you elect to use this Website, you, and you alone, have assumed the risk of doing so.
