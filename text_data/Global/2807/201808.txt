This privacy policy sets out how Stockland Corporation Limited and its related companies and trusts ("Stockland", “we”, “our” or “us”) collects, uses, stores, discloses and manages your personal information and how Stockland complies with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act").
By providing personal information to us, you consent to our collection, use, storage, disclosure and management of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and any other arrangements that apply between us. We may change our privacy policy from time to time by publishing changes to it on our website. We encourage you to check our website periodically to ensure that you are aware of our current privacy policy.
What is personal information?
When used in this privacy policy, the term 'personal information' has the meaning given to it in the Act. In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address and occupation. If the information Stockland collects personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered to be personal information.
What personal information do we collect?
The information Stockland collects about you depends on the products, services or information that you ask us to provide to you and the dealings that you have with us. We may collect the following types of personal information:
- your name, date of birth, gender and contact details including your physical address, mailing address, email address and telephone number;
- bank account and credit card details;
- information to verify your identity such as your driver licence number;
