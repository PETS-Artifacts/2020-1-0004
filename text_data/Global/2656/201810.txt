Collected Information
You do not have to provide any personal information to read the content of our Websites. However, there are many instances where an individual may provide the Society with personal information. These include but are not limited to: students applying to participate in an education program (e.g. Intel Science Talent Search), an individual subscribing to one of our publications (e.g. Science News) or other communications (e.g. enewsletter or eblast), an individual who is a member/volunteer or who is interested in volunteering/becoming a member, an individual who claims and maintains a profile and/or claims a digital achievement badge in the Student Alumni Network or an individual who makes a donation or purchases a gift membership. Information that may be collected includes name, address, city, state, zip code, email address, date or year of birth, school, grade level, awards, username and/or password. For entrants in the Intel ISEF, the Regeneron STS and Broadcom MASTERS, the Society also requests social security number and ethnicity, but providing this information is optional. If an entrant wins a monetary prize for participating in the Society competitions, the entrant will be required to provide their tax identification number to process payment in accordance with IRS rules. 
Users may use the Websites without registering, but registration must occur in order to use any of the personalized web services. The Websites’ registration form requires specific contact information, including, but not limited to, name, address and e-mail address.  Users’ contact information is used to learn more about our Users and to contact Users when necessary. Unique identifiers are collected to verify a User's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.
When you make a donation or gift membership, become a member or renew a membership, we also ask for your credit card information (i.e., card type, number, security code and expiration date). Credit card payment processing is handled by a third party and we do not receive or store any credit card information.
To post comments on our Websites, you must register with and provide personal information to a third-party provider. The personal information provided to the third-party provider is governed by its privacy policy.
The following guidelines set forth our practices for handling your personal information.
Education Program Applicants, Entrants and Finalists
The Society currently administers programs that typically engage students ages 13 and older. Any student providing information as part of an application, whether or not selected for a program, will have their information used for consideration of entry to the program and to send communications about the applied-for program and other the Society programs, membership and publications.
Applicants selected to participate in an the Society program will have their applicant information transferred to an Alumni Database following program participation. Certain information, including name, school, hometown, competition and year of participation, competition abstract and any awards won, may be automatically published in the online Student Alumni Network. Those individuals will be able to claim their profiles by registering with the Society and upon registration, edit their profiles, upload photos and provide additional information, all in accordance with the Society’s Terms of Use. Those individuals also may be contacted by the Society’s alumni program staff for participation in additional alumni activity. the Society may also contact alumni concerning other the Society programs, membership and publications.
Certain programs require the Society membership and students cannot opt-out of communications with the Society that are related to participation in these programs. 
Subscribers, members, donors, “friends” and other commercial activity
Many individuals provide information in order to volunteer with the Society, receive the the Society Newsletter, the Science News daily/weekly email newsletter or the Science News for Students email newsletter or otherwise participate in or learn more about the Society programs and publications. For example, Users may be prompted for address information in order to subscribe to the Society publications, including, but not limited to, Science News, the Society Newsletter, the SNS email newsletter and the SN daily/weekly email newsletter. Addresses and other personally identifiable information will be stored as necessary to process and fulfill an individual’s gift, membership, subscription or other commercial transaction. The Society may send solicitation and/or subscription offers along with these communications, subject to a User’s opt-out selection described below. This information may also be shared with other programs and publications of the Society or as otherwise described elsewhere in this Policy.
From time to time, the Society may rent subscriber information to third party organizations.  If you would like us to remove your name from such lists, please contact us via mail, telephone or email address as provided for in the Third-Party Disclosure of Information found elsewhere in this policy.
E-mail Communications
The Society sends email communications to current and past members, program participants, volunteers, subscribers, digital badge earners and other individuals or organizations upon request. Every bulk email includes an “unsubscribe” link that will allow the recipient to decline all future email communication from the Society. Removal from all lists may take up to five business days to complete. Replying directly to the email, rather than using the unsubscribe form, may require additional time to process.
The only instance where an “unsubscribe” link would not be included in the bottom would be an email sent as direct correspondence from an the Society staff person. Please respond directly back to that individual staff person if you would prefer to be removed from future communication.
