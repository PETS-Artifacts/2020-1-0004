Unique Email Address
For your convenience and security, your email address is unique to you in the system. (ESMO does not permit two different persons to have the same email address in the system). You are strongly recommended to use an email address which is personal to you and that is not shared with others. This is to ensure that communications which are sent to you personally are not read by others, and that others do not gain access to the information in your ‘My ESMO’ account. Furthermore, ESMO may use your email address to communicate with you about value added products linked either to your membership or your congress attendance.Your unique email permits automated retrieval of your login details, which are sent to your personal email address.
Data from surveys and questionnairesESMO conducts a number of surveys or questionnaires every year whereby we collect data from volunteer respondents about a certain number of topics that are of interest to us as a society or to the practice of oncology. The respondent data remains completely anonymous, unless the respondents specifically choose to share their contact data. Upon completion of the survey or questionnaire, to ensure confidentiality, information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to the survey tool platform. Data entered are stored on the survey tool server, which is accessible through a dedicated ESMO account only. When exported, data are stored on ESMO's internal server. To ensure the complete anonymity of all respondents, all data collected are kept confidential and no individual respondent’s answers will be disclosed at any time by ESMO or Rare Cancers Europe.

‘My ESMO’ – Managing your contact with ESMO

provide you with online services like Abstract Submission, Registration for Congresses, etc.
save you having to keep giving the same information for different ESMO services

So, if an account already exists for you in the ESMO system, your new account will be matched to it, within a reasonable timeframe, but longer during or after ESMO organised conference/meeting periods for technical reasons.If you do happen to create a second account, then you should be aware that ESMO will merge your  membership and other information regarding products and services used between your accounts, and your contact details held by ESMO will be replaced by the new ones you entered.
