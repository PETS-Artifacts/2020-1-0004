The global single sign on will allow Reebok systems to identify you wherever you are in the world, meaning you will not need to register with us again if you are signing in from a different country.In addition, Reebok will create a profile for you with the information needed to provide you with our products or services. The personal information we collect from the other sources listed above will be used in the format that it is received, or, where appropriate, will be combined with personal information we obtain from other internal or external sources. We use and analyze this personal information for the various other purposes detailed below:

Reebok will, upon receipt of any irrelevant information from the social network, discard such information. After having created your account, you will have the opportunity to supplement it with any information you would like to share with us, such as personal information you provide through a completed survey. Any supplemental information you provide to us will be used for the purposes explained in this statement, including to enrich your Reebok profile and to personalize your Reebok experience.Marketing: when you signup to receive Reebok newsletters, create a Reebok single sign on, become a member of a Reebok Community, use a Reebok app, order or provide feedback on a product or service online or use our website, we will use your personal information to create a profile based on the information we hold about you. We create your profile in accordance with your preferences in order to provide you with the best personalized experience, to send you personalized marketing messages and newsletters and for opinion research purposes. Below you can find a more detailed description of the ways in which we will use your personal information for these purposes.What kind of information: the way you interact with our brand across all the different channels described above (e.g. the Reebok website, apps, social media and marketing messages we send you) and the information we collect in that regard from each of these channels provides us valuable information about your interests and preferences. This insight gives us the opportunity to offer you the best Reebok experience possible. To learn about you and your interests, we analyze your interactions with our brand using various kinds of information, as set out above. In particular, we may combine the information we collect with information collected by third parties. If you have given us your consent to send you marketing communications, we use the information that you have provided to us when interacting with us for sending you personalized marketing messages about Reebok products or services, events, Prize Giveaways and promotions. In some instances we will also aggregate your personal information with that of other individuals, to create comprehensive reports about how customers use our products and services, and experience our brand.What kind of channels: we will send direct marketing communications to you via the channel you choose, such as email, phone, or social media. We ask for your consent, where required by applicable law, in order to use the contact details you have provided to us to send our personalized marketing communications.What kind of messages: the messages we will send you will be personalized and tailored to your individual preferences and interests. We use analytics in order to generate such personalized messages. These direct marketing messages may contain information about our products and services, events, Prize Giveaways or promotions and Reebok news. We will, in certain circumstances, also use the channels for opinion research (such as to ask if you would like to participate in a survey) and to learn about your experience and improve your experience with Reebok, including by sending you personalized messages.Re-targeting: our websites and apps use re-targeting technologies. This enables us to show our visitors, who were already interested in our shop and our products and/or services, advertisements from us on partner websites. We believe that the display of personalized, interest-based advertising is more interesting and relevant to our customers than advertising that does not have a personal connection. Re-targeting technologies analyze the information we collect about your interactions with each Reebok platform as described in relation to marketing above, including your cookies, and display advertisements based on your past web-surfing behavior. Please click here for further information on cookies and instructions on how to disable re-targeting.

These companies may collect personal information about your visits to our websites or apps and your interaction with our communications, including advertising.Enrichment of our data: where we have obtained your personal information from various sources we will combine this information in certain circumstances in order to enrich our understanding of your requirements and preferences in relation to our Reebok products and services. For example, we may combine information you have provided us directly with information collected automatically, such as metadata or IP addresses or where we have collected anonymous browsing data through the use of cookies, we may later determine that this data relates to your browsing history and combine that data with the existing information we hold on you. We may also combine this information with other information (both-personal and anonymized) that we have obtained from third parties. We may use the information we hold to correlate your interactions with us via one device (such as a browser on a computer) with your interactions with us via another device (such as an app on a phone). Specifically, we may carry out any of these exercises to be able to send you more personalized marketing or to prepare more effective marketing campaigns.Improving our products and services: we will use the personal information we hold about you (as well as pseudonymized or anonymized information generated from your personal information) to carry out analysis and research, including:
	data science/analytics, whereby we combine information (such as personal information and/or sensitive personal information we have obtained through the use of a Reebok sporting app or from your browsing history) we hold on a large scale in order:
		learn more about our customers and their preferences;to identify patterns and trends amongst our customers;enhance user experience on our websites;provide information, content and offerings tailored to our customers' needs;for general research and statistical purposes; andfor aggregated reporting purposes within the adidas group;
develop new products and services;monitor performance of our products and services and/or improve our technology;to be able to send you personalized marketing messages;to display online ads to you.
