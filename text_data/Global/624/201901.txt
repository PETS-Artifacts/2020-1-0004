                Because ViewBug enables people to discover and share information with one another, information about the people who use ViewBug is an integral part of the ViewBug experience. Rest assured that we will not rent or sell your personal information to anyone and that we will share your personal information only as described below:
                
ViewBug Personnel: ViewBug personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of ViewBug business.
Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if ViewBug, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.
Protection of ViewBug and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ViewBug, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
User Profile information: Information collected during registration and subsequent visits, such as your full name and location, may be displayed to other ViewBug users in your User Profile. The User Profile is the area on ViewBug where we allow you to tell other ViewBug users about yourself. You may control what personal information is displayed in your User Profile by visiting the Settings section of your User Profile.
Followers' Activity: Much like other online social networks, ViewBug allows non-followers to browse your followers’ activity.
Syndication: ViewBug allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the ViewBug website.
Service Providers: ViewBug may share user information as well as information from tools such as cookies, log files, device identifiers and location data, with third-parties that help ViewBug provide services to you (“Service Providers”). Our Service Providers will be given access to your information as is reasonably necessary for ViewBug to provide our services. ViewBug requires Services Providers to protect your data in a manner consistent with this Policy and to limit the use of such information to the performance of services for ViewBug. ViewBug may also remove parts of data that can identify you and share anonymized data with Service Providers, including combining your information with other information in a way that it is no longer associated with you.
With Your Consent: Except as noted above, we will contact you when your personal information is shared with third parties or used for a purpose incompatible with the purpose(s) for which it was originally collected, and you will be able to opt out to prevent the sharing of this information.
