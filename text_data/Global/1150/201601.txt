Hii Dassana
I am a huge fan of ur recipes and thanx to u both I am managing my kitchen without any issue :P.
Today I am writing for a very personal request . Couldn’t find email option hence using “comment”. I have tried many of ur recipes and now I would love to try a hand in baking. But the problem is I know nothing about baking. (Nothing means absolutely nothing ) Is there any specific link u have mentioned regarding baking? Can u share some tips and knowledge for ppl like me who would like to start baking . Or is there any specific blog/book which can guide me? I just have a LG microwave at home which I use only for heating food  . Hope u can guide me here as well.
Lots of gratitude for your good work…

thank you very much rashmi. i do plan to compile such a post on baking in the future. right now i do not have any post or page dedicated to baking tips and know how. let me know what are you looking for to bake… like only breads or cakes (eggless or with eggs). i can guide to some books which i have on bread baking. for cakes, there is no book which i know of sharing tips but there are recipes, which can also help.

Hello Dassana ji,
I never thought that I will be able to cook food like my mummy after she passed away 16months back, but then while surfing net for particular receipe, I tried yours and it was exactly like she use to cook.
Thanks for sharing all the kitchen knowledge you have. Thanks for passing on my mother’s Knowledge to me.
My families just love whatever I cook from your blog.
God bless you.

Hi Dassana,
First of all, a big Thank you to you for all your recipes. I tried the orange cake today and the taste was very good. But the cake was very soft and I couldn’t slice it and it all crumbled. Where did I go wrong?
I couldn’t post a comment anywhere else so I’m doing it here. Every Time I want to post a comment I cannot find the option on any of the recipe pages. Just wanted to let you know.
Thanks

ranjini, i feel the cake needed to be baked more. thats why it was soft. oven temperatures vary with make, model and size. so no two ovens will have the same heating conditions inside. so while baking any cake with any recipe, always keep this in mind. the test should be that the top should be browned and the toothpick should have fine crumbs on it or should come out clean. sometimes when we bake cakes, there is a sticky feeling on the palette from the crumbs. in this case too, the cake should be baked for some more minutes. 
lastly always wait for the cake to cool completely and then remove from pan. if you remove or slice when the cake is hot or warm, the cake will crumble. 
yesterday, i have opened the comments on all posts now. and thanks a lot.

I just love your recipes… they’re amazing..
As good as your recipes are, I would like to highlight the recent change in your website layout and design (yes, I’m a Computer Science guy and hence a nerd)… Its really amazing how you’ve managed to keep it so simple (love the color selection), yet beautiful and so easy to navigate! Keep up the good work! You guys rock!!

Hi, Dassana,
very very congratulations for this new look. I am fan of yours team work….
I am about to start my food blog. As my parents were running small restaurant, i m aware about cooking, and my mother-in-law is master of it… professionally i was lecturer in computer engineering. so i know about blogging..
But i am not confident about food photography. will you suggest about some tips about it? Right now, for starting i m not gonn’a use professional camera . but still i don’t have any knowledge about  photography. should i go thought photography classes or any special training??? 
I hope you will help me out about this…

thanks a lot reena. you have a great amount of experience in food business and this is a plus factor for you. i am sharing two links below where we have shared resource and a how to on blogging. 
for food photography, what matters most is the person behind the camera. a good camera is definitely required but the photographer is also equally important. right in the beginning, i would suggest to go for an a dslr with a good lens. do not take the kit lens which comes along with the camera. the kit lens is not good for food photos. just buy the camera body and take another lens. you can search on google for good lens for food photos. one lens which i like is a canon fast lens – 1.8/50 mm. its a fixed lens and very light. also not expensive. good for low lighting too.  
if you take a professional camera later, then you will have an extra work to update the old pics with the ones taken with the professional camera. so right at the first go, buy a lens. if budget is an issue, then go for an entry level dslr. i use canon and its really good. nikon is another brand. 
you can go through photography classes if you want. also there are many tutorials and tips available online. many food bloggers have shared and you can always read them. there is a website also – http://www.learnfoodphotography.com/ and through this website you can avail of free photography classes. i think they have already begun their course. 
you can also buy a few books on food photography. these will also help. all the best

Hi Dassana,
I am sure you have heard this a million times, but let me say it one more time: Your recipes are wonderful and really simple to follow. The photos are great too! Keep up the great job! 
The first time I tried my hand at baking bread was a disappointing failure and it made me afraid of yeast. The second time, I discovered you site and tried your veg pizza and it turned out really great. That gave me confidence to work with yeast again. Thank you! 
Today, I am in the process of making pav, but I don’t think it’s going too well. The 3 times that I used yeast, it never bubbled, but the pizza turned out great despite. Today, however the dough for the pav has not doubled up, although it has been 1 hour already. The dough is also not elastic like it was at the time of the pizza. Have I killed the yeast?
I have read in some of your post that the quality of the yeast is important. I am using “Golden Eagle” Active Dried Yeast which is well within the expiry date. Do you know whether this is a good quality brand? Could you please suggest a few good brands of yeast that are readily available in stores in India?
Thanks a lot again!

hi ketaki, there is no need to get scared of yeast. many folks have this fear and they never venture into baking breads. eagle brand is not good. i have used almost all the indian brands. most of them are bad. two brands which i found good were muksha and gloripan/mauripan. when living in goa, i would not get these brands and so would work with blue bird, which was also fine. you can also buy these brands online. for the pav, either its the yeast issue or the dough needs to be kneaded more. give it a time of at least 2 to 2:30 hours more and see if the dough doubles up.

Hi Dassana,
The new design is really nice, it takes the site to a whole new level. There were some bugs earlier which I now see are fixed (and maybe some which still need some attention) though overall it’s amazing (-:
Keep the recipes coming, I now almost exclusively look at your site for all the inspiration in my cooking adventures.  I’m from Goa and turned completely vegetarian and your site helped me find great alternatives to things I perceived I was missing out on. 
Thanks for taking the time to share your recipes (and replying to the comments on each recipe)! 😀
PS: Maybe your can add a visitor comment page so there is one central location for all the praise coming your way? Right now I just realised that comments are spread over multiple pages on the site and I just added this to the first comment page I stumbled upon that was not a recipe.

there are some bugs that still need to be fixed. we are still working on it. thanks nikhil for your positive feedback. i will think about the visitor comment page. the comments are spread out on the recipes and this helps the readers to try the recipes or make their own variations.
