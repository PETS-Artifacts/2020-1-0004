Courses and Study
Open Days
Our undergraduate and postgraduate open days take place throughout the year to give you the chance to find out more about studying with us. You'll get the opportunity to learn about the courses we have on offer, view our specialist facilities and meet the tutors from your subject area of interest. You can also take a tour of the campus, our accommodation and our facilities at MediaCityUK.
We will also be running a wide range of talks and sessions so you can learn more about student life and what to expect at Salford– as well as a handy session on managing your student budget. Parents and supporters are also welcome and on our undergraduate open days we will be running specific sessions on supporting your son or daughter through higher education.
We also hold specific events for applicants and offer holders. These events will give you the opportunity to attend taster sessions and workshops to give you a flavor of what it’s really like to study here.
Places are limited so book now to guarantee your place.
