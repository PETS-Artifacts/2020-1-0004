            We collect information on our users through registration and the use of the Website, through cookies, where you choose to disclose data in postings, and when you enter sales promotion and competitions.
        

            We use cookies for a number of reasons:
        

            (i) To gather statistics. We track how many ‘unique users’ we have and how often they visit our websites.

Accurate statistics enable us to sell advertising and continue to provide a top quality service to you.

4. Types of cookie that may be used

            The following types of cookie are used on this site. We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
        


A. First Party Cookies

            These are our own cookies, controlled by us and used to provide information about usage of our site.
        

            (i) Personalisation cookies
        

            These cookies are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at the Website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and the path you take through the Website). These are used to recommend content we think you'll be interested in based on what you're looked at before.
        

            (ii) Analytics cookies
        

            These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
        

            (iii) Our own ad serving and management cookies
        

            We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers - they pay for the content you enjoy for free.
        

            As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (i.e.  it is not linked to you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - so we could show you an advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
        

            These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        

            (iv) Site management cookies
        

            These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).
        


B. Third Party Cookies

            These are cookies found in other companies’ internet tools which we are using to enhance our Website, for example Facebook or Twitter, have their own cookies, which are controlled by them.  The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies and the Company has no access to read or write these cookies, other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all
        
 (i) Third-party service cookies

            Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other companies. These companies may drop cookies on your computer when you use them on our Website or if you are already logged in to them.
        
 (ii) Other ad management cookies

            Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
        

            Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        

            These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser setting to refuse all cookies (see above) if you do not wish to accept them.
