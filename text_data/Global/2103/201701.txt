Once you link to another web site from the Site, you are subject to the terms and conditions of that web site, including, but not limited to, its Internet privacy policy.
What information, including personally identifiable information, does Collider collect from and about you?
Our goal in collecting information from and about you is to provide you with the best web experience possible, including providing proper formatting for our web pages and to provide you with information on topics and gadgets of greatest interest to you.
In order to provide you with our services, Collider collects two types of information from its community: passive technical information and information you voluntarily provide to Collider, including personally identifiable information.
• Passive Collection of Technical Information.
Collider automatically collects certain technical information about each visitor, including your IP address, the type of browser you use to surf the Internet, your screen resolution, the URL you visited prior to arriving at the Site, and your computer’s operating system, without you doing anything at all. Your IP address tells us both your Internet Service Provider ( ISP) and the general geographic location from which you are connecting. We may also use your IP address to track the date and time you accessed the Site, how long you stayed on the Site, and what pages you visited. This information is used internally by Collider to help us provide a good web experience, including proper formatting for our web pages. This information is also provided in the aggregate to third parties, including advertisers, to describe basic use patterns for the Site, but this information is not linked to any personally identifiable information before it is disclosed unless Collider has obtained your consent.
Information, including IP addresses and domain names, is automatically logged to provide technical support for the Collider web site and its associated computer systems, to diagnose system performance or problem areas, and to detect attempts to damage or gain unauthorized access to the web site and its associated computer systems.
To better serve you, we use ‘cookies’ to enhance or customize your visit to this Site. Cookies are simple text files stored on your web browser. These files provide a way to distinguish among visitors to this Site. Cookies created on the device you use to access this website do not contain personal information and do not compromise your privacy or security. We use the cookie feature to store a randomly generated identifying tag on the device you use to access this Site. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet web sites. The software and hardware you use to access the Site allows you to refuse the cookie or delete the cookie file at any time. Refusing or deleting a cookie may, however, limit your ability to take advantage of some features of this Site.
• Information You Provide.
Collider does not require anyone to register and become a Collider member to use the Site. If you do register to take advantage of Collider’s membership benefits, however, Collider requires that you provide us your first and last name and your ZIP code. Collider will ask you to provide other optional information. Additionally, we ask for your address, gender, and phone number as optional information in registering to become a Collider member so that we can learn more about who our users are and what they want out of our Site. In order to better understand our users and to provide you with a better web experience, Collider may analyze the ages of our users in connection with the pages our users tend to visit and which shows they access. Collider’s use and disclosure of the information you provide us, including personally identifiable information is set forth below.
If during your visit to the Site you complete a transaction such as a survey, registration, or order form, the information, including personal information, volunteered by you is used by Collider and/or third-party advertisers. This information is collected by Collider and/or third-party advertisers and may be disclosed by Collider and/or third-party advertisers for those purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of the survey, registration, or order form in which the information was submitted
What other organizations besides Collider may be collecting information from you on the Site?
Collider uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site, other websites and other forms of media about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here.
What happens to my information after Collider collects it?
When we collect personally identifiable information from you, we do not share any information with third parties outside of Collider without your consent. You can give this consent by “opting-in” to having your information shared with third parties when you register. These third parties may include our marketing partners, who may want specific information to better shape their marketing efforts. Additionally, we provide the community the opportunity to choose to be sent newsletters and other information. We will not send this information to you unless you “opt in” for these services and publications.
In addition, Collider will not sell, dispose, or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent except as specifically set forth in this paragraph and in the preceding paragraph. When you choose to supply Collider with your personally identifying information, Collider compiles this information in a database with other Collider community members’ information and Collider reserves the right to transfer this information to a successor, related entity or to a third party purchasing or otherwise acquiring Collider’s assets.
How can you review and correct information you submitted to the Site, unsubscribe, or opt out?
If you choose to provide us with personally identifying information, you may remove your information from our databases by sending an email to info@Collider.com. In this email, you must include your user name and password, and a description of the information you would like to change.
