         This privacy policy specifies what information we collect from you, and what we do with that information once collected. Last updated 27-Sep-2017.   

Openness ¶ 
We firmly believe in our customers' right to privacy, and we respect that right by adhering to the concept of Fair Information Practices.
We are certainly not trying to confuse you with a 20-page privacy statement that absolves us of all responsibility, all the while removing any rights to your information that you may have had.
Collection Limitation ¶ 
When you visit our site, our servers automatically collect these pieces of information from your computer:
IP AddressInformation automatically sent by your browserAny other information you voluntarily send to us
All additional information you provide is stored on our secure server until you request we remove it. We store credit card information in a physically secure data center using industry-standard strong encryption.
We use cookies to track your profile on our site, track site usage using Google Analytics, and show ads about iFixit on sites around the internet. Third-party vendors use these cookies to display ads on sites other than ifixit.com. Google also collects Google-authenticated identifiers associated with Google accounts (and therefore, personal information) and uses this data to display ads. You can opt out of this cookie collection here. And Google users can control their ads experience (or opt out of personalized ads altogether) in Google's Account Settings.
Data Quality ¶ 
We strive to maintain the most accurate information possible in order to maintain our high quality standard of service. If any of your information changes, please log in to the website and update it, or contact a customer service representative to do so for you.
Purpose Specification ¶ 
We only collect information that is relevant to our mission of providing you with the best customer service possible. All the information we collect is directly tied to serving you as a user of our site, and not for any other purpose.
Use Limitation ¶ 
When you place an order, we provide your name, address, and credit card information to our credit card processor to validate and charge your card. When we ship your order, we provide your name, address, and phone number to our shipping company. If you choose to subscribe to our mailing list, we will share your email with our mailing service. We share the email address, IP address, and content of public posts with our spam filtering service.
We will never provide your personal information to any other third party, without your express permission, unless required by law.
Security Safeguards ¶ 
We take significant precautions to protect your information. Communications between your browser and our server are encrypted using at least 128-bit SSL. Your financial information is stored in our secure data center, using industry-standard strong encryption.
In the unlikely event that your information was compromised, we would notify you immediately pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.29.
Individual Participation ¶ 
You own your personally-identifying information, and have the right to control our access to it. At any time, you can log in and access, modify, or remove your information from our server.
Accountability ¶ 
We pledge to adhere to these Principles. If you believe that we have violated these terms, please contact us and we'll do our utmost to rectify the situation.
For California Residents ¶ 
Your California Privacy Rights ¶ 
As noted above, we do not share your information for direct marketing purposes. But our lawyer said we need to tell you that California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of our website who are California residents to request and obtain from us a list of what personal information (if any) we have shared with third parties or corporate affiliates for those entities’ direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, and the names and addresses of those third parties. Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.
If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: iFixit, Attn: Privacy Agent, 1330 Monterey St, CA 93401. For all requests, you must put the statement “California Privacy Rights Notice” in the body of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. You also need to attest to the fact that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response. Please note that we will not accept requests via telephone, email or facsimile, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not contain complete information.
California Do Not Track Disclosures ¶ 
California Business & Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies. We do not currently take actions to respond to DNT signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed. We continue to review new technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once one is created. For information about DNT, visit All About DNT.
