This Policy applies to our retail stores, our Web Sites, and all other channels in which Best Buy collects and uses your personal information.At Best Buy we know how important it is to protect your personal information. Whether you are shopping with us online or in person we want to make every customer experience safe and secure. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Privacy Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.What we collect
At Best Buy, we collect two types of information: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect depend on the nature of your interaction with us.
Your Consent
Best Buy will collect, use, or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by law. When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Privacy Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.
Personal information
Personal information is information that can identify an individual or information about an identifiable individual. We may collect personal information such as:

your contact information - e.g., name, postal address, telephone number, and email address;
your personal preferences - e.g., product wish lists, language preferences, and marketing consent; and your transaction information - e.g., products purchased, method of payment, amount paid, and credit or debit card number.

Non-personal information

Non-personal information does not identify you as an individual. For example:

we may ask you for your postal code to assist us with planning our flyer distribution;
we may collect certain non-personal data when you visit our Web Sites, such as the type of browser you are using or the referring URL; or
we may collect and summarize customer information in a non-personal, aggregate format for statistical and research purposes. We may, for example, summarize our data to determine that a certain percentage of contest entrants are male, aged 18 to 25.

All references to "Web Sites" in this Privacy Policy mean www.bestbuy.ca, www.geeksquad.ca, or other Best Buy provided Web sites.
You may choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information that you requested. For example, we can only offer you a Best Buy credit card if you have provided us with certain financial information.
Supplementing Information
From time to time we may supplement information you give us with information from other sources, such as information validating your address or other available information you have provided us. This is to help us maintain the accuracy of the information we collect and to help us provide better service.

Examples where we need contact information include delivery services, product servicing, in-home installations, and extended warranty coverage. We also may use your contact information to send you promotional information.
Returns and Exchanges
Our goal is to ensure that you are completely satisfied with your purchase and to this end, Best Buy offers a Return Policy. For Best Buy to continue to offer our Return Policy, we ask for personal information such as your name, address, and telephone number for the purposes of detecting and preventing fraud. You may also be asked to produce photo ID for verification purposes only.

ReClaim Insurance Replacement
When working with our ReClaim Consultants to replace goods that are covered under your insurance policy, we will need some basic information, such as your contact information, insurance claim number, and the name of your claim adjuster, so we can process your quote in a timely manner and bill your insurance company directly for you.
Purchase Follow-Up and Surveys
Following a purchase from some of our departments we may send you a follow-up letter to thank you for your business, or we may contact you to ensure that you are completely satisfied with the delivery, setup, or installation of your new product.
We may use contact information collected in-store, online, or via our call centres to conduct occasional surveys and other customer research. These surveys are entirely voluntary and you may easily decline to participate.
Our Web Sites
Our Web Sites can be browsed anonymously. We use your browsing history and personal information to display interest-based advertising that is relevant to you. We place interest-based advertisements on our website as well as other third-party sites. The browsing history we use is collected by us and by third parties on our website. We may also share your anonymous browsing history from our website with third parties to provide relevant ads. They may combine this information with assumptions based on the other websites you have visited in order to tailor ads to you.
To engage in certain special features or functions of our Web Sites, or to order products and services from our Web Sites, you may be asked to provide certain personal information, such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone number, or credit card information. We use this information to create your account, contact and correspond with you about your order, respond to your inquiries, and monitor functions of our Web Sites that you choose to use, such as Customer Reviews.
If you choose to ship an order to a third party, you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from the third party to permit Best Buy to collect, use, and disclose the third party’s personal information for the purposes of fraud prevention and processing and shipping the order. 
Customer Reviews
The Customer Review functionality is provided as a rating system that offers you the chance to share your thoughts on a product. These reviews are accessible to all Web Site visitors so please use discretion when posting information to them and do not post personal information.
Sign-Up for Newsletters or Updates
Best Buy offers a variety of newsletters and promotional communications. You may choose to stop receiving these communications at any time. Each marketing or promotional email we send to you will include a link or other method to quickly and easily unsubscribe and decline further similar emails. You may also use the unsubscribe link included below under the heading "Unsubscribe.” For Reward Zone communications please refer to the "Reward Zone Membership" section below. Our subscriber list is never sold or rented to other parties. 
Participate in a Contest or Promotion
From time to time, we may run contests or promotions. If you participate, you may be asked for contact information as well as additional optional survey information (for example, product preferences). Personal information from contest entries will be used only to administer the contest and contact you if you win. For research and analysis purposes, we may also summarize contest survey information in a manner that no longer identifies individual participants. All contests and promotions are subject to this Privacy Policy and the rules that will be available with each particular campaign. Some contests are conducted by third parties and will be subject to the third party’s policies.
Email a Friend
While visiting our Web Sites you may choose to use the "Email a Friend" tool which allows you to inform a friend about products of interest to you. The information you provide will be used to send a one-time email to your friend, inviting them to our Web Sites. We will not add your friend to a mailing list and will not send them further email unless they choose to receive such communications from us. When using the "Email a Friend" tool you are contacting your friend directly and as such you acknowledge that you are responsible for this correspondence and not Best Buy. If you provide us with personal information concerning another individual (e.g., email address), you represent and warrant that you have obtained all necessary consents from that individual to enable us to use that personal information for the identified purpose.
Reward Zone Membership
Loyalty and rewards programs, such as Reward Zone, include a component where we ask for your contact information so we can administer the program. Your membership application information, information about your transactions and redemptions, and any other information you provide from time to time will be used to administer your membership, communicate with you about your membership, and to better understand your preferences and eligibility for Best Buy’s products and services. Membership in Reward Zone will result in certain membership-related communications (such as notification of reward certificates, statement updates, and program updates). On occasion Best Buy may also use this information to provide you with additional personalized marketing, notifications of sales and special events, and other exclusive member-only offers. If you do not wish to receive these additional special offers and notifications, you may so indicate on your online enrolment form or by updating your preferences in your Reward Zone profile.
Subscription Services and Activations
Best Buy may offer activation of certain products and services like cellular plans, satellite services, or Internet services. These activations may require that certain contact and financial information be collected and provided to the respective service providers as part of the activation process. For example, a cellular carrier may need to perform a credit check prior to activation so a government-issued ID number and your credit card number may be provided to the carrier for that purpose.
Call Centres
Best Buy operates customer support call centres to accept and address your questions, concerns, or complaints. When you contact our call centres, we may ask for personal information to help us respond to your inquiry or to verify your identity. For example if you have a question about the status of a recent online order, we will ask for personal information to verify that you are the account holder. We may also monitor or record your telephone discussions with our customer support representatives for training purposes and to ensure service quality.

How you can protect your information
Steps to protect your online accounts 
1.    Create a Strong Password
•    Create a unique password for this site and don't re-use passwords
•    Don't use a single word, even if you use letter substitutions
•    Longer is better; sentences are okay as long as they're not a well-known or well-used phrase
•    Include numbers and special characters (&, !, " are a few examples) to make your password even stronger 
•    Passwords are case-sensitive, so use a mixture of upper and lowercase letters
•    Don't use information easily found on the Internet (for example, personal information that could be found on Facebook, Twitter or other social media sites)
2.    Change Passwords Often
You should change your password every 90 days to help protect your account.
3.    Use Different Passwords Across Websites
Don't use the same username and password combination for multiple websites.
4.    Check Your Credit Card Charges
Be vigilant about ensuring all your charges are legitimate. If you see any suspicious charges, contact your credit card or bank and the retailer through which the order was placed to have the charges removed and, of course, change your sign-in information on any compromised account.
5.    Use Anti-Virus Software
Install anti-virus or anti-malware software from a reputable company. Note: After it's installed, run a full scan of your computer. Need help? Visit a Best Buy store near you or call Geek Squad at 1-800-433-5778.
6.    Be on the Lookout for Phishing and Smishing Scams
Attempts at obtaining personal information from consumers for use in committing fraud are on the rise worldwide. Individuals trick consumers into revealing personal information by posing as legitimate businesses. Best Buy is the target of many of these scams today and consumers are receiving e-mails and texts containing these fraudulent offers. Consumers can protect themselves from these schemes by being on the lookout and knowing when to disregard this type of activity.
Types of scams 
Gift Card Scams

A website advertisement, e-mail or text message that offers a high-value gift card.

How the scam works: The scam directs consumers to a website that requires them to make purchases, provide personal information, and/or fulfill other conditions in order to receive the gift card. Once the conditions are met, the consumer may never receive the gift card or may have spent more than the value of the gift card.
Phishing Scam

A valid-looking e-mail, website or other online message that directs consumers to a 
legitimate-appearing website that requests account information and/or other confidential information.
Phishing messages often indicate that a consumer's account has been frozen or jeopardized and that 
the consumer must provide immediate information.

How the scam works: Once confidential information is obtained, identity theft and other forms of theft can occur.

Smishing Scams

Similar to a Phishing scam, but in this situation, consumers receive a text in order to carry out the scam.

Note: A gift card offer may also be the subject of Phishing and Smishing messages.
How to Protect Yourself
Gift Card

•    Don't respond to e-mails, text messages or online ads offering free gift cards unless you are expecting this communication from a company
•    Make sure the website address and branding match up with the company referenced in the offer
•    Do not pay for services or products with iTunes gift cards

Phishing/Smishing Scams

•    Contact organizations only through trusted channels
•    Beware of e-mails and texts that have you "verify" personal information online.-- most legitimate companies will never request personal information in this manner including Best Buy
•    Scammers may attempt create a feeling of panic — don't rush to respond to or follow the dictates of suspicious e-mails
•    Don't click on links or cut and paste links from questionable e-mail and text messages and websites
•    Read the terms and conditions of offers — they often require that consumers take inappropriate or unreasonable actions
•    URL-checker software and other software is available that can protect against phishing scams
•    Report the fraudulent text to your mobile provider
