The type and quantity of information we collect and how we use it depends on why you are providing it. 
Supporters
If you support us, for example make a donation, volunteer, register to fundraise,  sign up for an event or buy something from our shop, we will usually collect:
Your name
Your contact details
Your date of birth
Your bank or credit card details. 
Where it is appropriate we may also ask for:
Information relating to your health (for example if you are taking part in a high risk event) 
Why you have decided to donate to us. We will never make this question mandatory, and only want to know the answer if you are comfortable telling us.
We will mainly use your data to:
Provide you with the services, products or information you asked for
Administer your donation or support your fundraising, including processing gift aid
Keep a record of your relationship with us
Ensure we know how you prefer to be contacted
Understand how we can improve our services, products or information.
If you enter your details onto one of our online forms, and you don’t ‘send’ or ‘submit’ the form, we may contact you to see if we can help with any problems you may be experiencing with the form or our websites.
We may also use your personal information to detect and reduce fraud and credit risk.
Building profiles of supporters and targeting communications
We use profiling and screening techniques to ensure communications are relevant and timely, and to provide an improved experience for our supporters.  Profiling also allows us to target our resources effectively, which donors consistently tell us is a key priority for them.  We do this because it allows us to understand the background of the people who support us and helps us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may be able and willing to give more than they already do.  Importantly, it enables us to raise more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would. 
When building a profile we may analyse geographic, demographic and other information relating to you in order to better understand your interests and preferences in order to contact you with the most relevant communications.  In doing this, we may use additional information from third party sources when it is available.  Such information is compiled using publicly available data about you, for example addresses, listed Directorships or typical earnings in a given area. 
Direct Marketing
With your consent, we will contact you to let you know about the progress we are making and to ask for donations or other support.  Occassionally, we may include information from partner organisations or organisations who support us in these communications.  We make it easy for you to tell us how you want us to communicate, in a way that suits you. Our forms have clear marketing preference questions and we include information on how to opt out when we send you marketing. If you don’t want to hear from us, that’s fine.  Just let us know when you provide your data or contact us on 0300 123 3379 or preferences@cancer.org.uk.
We do not sell or share personal details to third parties for the purposes of marketing.  But, if we run an event in partnership with another named organisation your details may need to be shared. We will be very clear what will happen to your data when you register.
Sharing your story
Some people choose to tell us about their experiences with cancer to help further our work.  They may take on a role as an Ambassador or Media Volunteer, attend our patient focused events or sit on our committees.  This may include them sharing sensitive information related to their health and family life in addition to their biographical and contact information. 
We use some of the information provided, including gender, ethnicity or the type of cancer people have experience with, to target opportunities to get involved.  We will also monitor the types of people who are involved to ensure that the views we hear are representative of all people affected by cancer.
If we have the explicit and informed consent of the individuals, or their parent or guardian if they are under 18, this information may be made public by us at events, in materials promoting our campaigning and fundraising work, or in documents such as our annual report. 
Support for individuals affected by Cancer
We run services to provide support to individuals affected by Cancer, and collect personal data in order to provide those services, this includes our Cancer Information Nurses and our online forum, Cancer Chat. This information is managed separately from other data provided to the charity.
Cancer Information Nurses collect sensitive personal data about your health when you speak, email or send an instant message to them.  They will use this information to answer your questions and give advice or guidance.  We will also use it for training, quality monitoring or evaluating the services we provide. 
Cancer Chat asks you to provide your email address when you register and may contact you about administrative issues and changes to the forum.  With your consent, we may also use your email address to send you information about our work.
Posts to the forum are anonymous but are likely to contain sensitive information.  We advise users to be careful not to post information which would allow them to be identified.
Cancer Research UK will only share your details in exceptional circumstances to comply with the nurses’ code of professional conduct or where legally required, for example where a child reports abuse, or someone reports serious self-harm or a serious intention of harming someone else.
We may also collect and retain your information if you send feedback about our services or make a complaint. 
Children’s data
We collect and manage information from children, and aim to manage it in a way which is appropriate to the age of the child.  Information is usually collected when children attend our events or fundraise for us. But it can also be sensitive personal data - of children nominated for our Kids and Teens Stars Award, or who contact the Cancer Information Nurses. 
Where possible and appropriate we will seek consent from a parent or guardian before collecting information about children.  Our events have specific rules about whether children can participate, and we‘ll make sure advertising for those events is age appropriate.
