 
At Ancestry, your privacy is a top priority. Ancestry is committed to always being a good steward of your Personal Information, handling it in a responsible manner, and securing it with industry standard administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Ancestry follows three guiding principles when it comes to your privacy:
 

Transparency. We work hard to be transparent about what Personal Information we collect and process.
Simplicity. We strive to use easy-to-understand language to describe our privacy practices to help you make informed choices.
Control. We give you control over the Personal Information you provide to us, including your DNA Data, and how it is used, shared, and retained.

 
Other Important Things for You to Understand When You Use Our Services

You always maintain ownership of your DNA and DNA Data—you can manage and delete it as described in this Statement.
You may discover unanticipated facts about yourself or your family when using our services. While we strive to give you control as you use the Services, once discoveries are made, we can’t undo it.

 
When you make new discoveries with us, you should feel confident and informed about how we use your Personal Information. Our full Privacy Statement is below and we encourage you to read it.
 
Effective as of December 14, 2017
 
1.  Introduction

This Privacy Statement describes our practices for collecting, storing and processing your Personal Information and the controls we provide you to manage it within our Services. In addition, we have a Cookie Policy that describes our use of browser cookies and similar tracking technologies which is considered a part of this Privacy Statement.

2.  Information We Collect From You
Account Information includes your name, email address, and a password that you provide us when you create an Ancestry account, and your phone number that we may collect to notify you of DNA test result status, or when you contact Ancestry Member Services by phone.
 
Credit Card/Payment Information: We collect payment information, such as your credit card number, and your billing and shipping address(es), when you purchase an Ancestry subscription or a DNA test kit.
 
DNA Kit Activation Information: When you activate a DNA test kit, we collect your DNA test kit code, your sex and year of birth.
 
Profile Information: We collect the information that you provide when you voluntarily create a user profile. This information may be seen by other users of the Services. If you do not enhance your Ancestry profile to include personal details (for example, a profile image, your name, age, location, etc.), only your username will be visible to other Ancestry members.
 
User Provided Content: We collect the information voluntarily provided by you when you populate your family tree, including stories, images, and any details about living individuals you list in your family tree. Information about deceased persons is not Personal Information under this Statement.
 
Genetic Information: We extract your DNA from your saliva at our partner laboratory when you submit it in the tube provided with your AncestryDNA test kit. We convert your DNA into machine-readable code (“DNA Data”), which is then used to provide you an ethnicity estimate as well as other information about you. For clarity, the Genetic Information we collect consists of:

Your DNA Data;
Information derived from your DNA Data. This includes your ethnicity estimate, your connection to genetic relatives in our database, and any genetic markers associated with physical traits, such as hair color or traits associated with your health and wellness. A ‘genetic marker’ is basically a DNA sequence or sequences that may identify a certain trait.

 
 
A note about your DNA and Saliva: Once our laboratory partner has produced your DNA Data, the DNA and saliva (also referred to as “biological samples”) are stored so that they can be available for future testing. Such future testing may be done under our Informed Consent to Research or otherwise if you consent. Section 7 below describes how you can control both your DNA Data and your biological samples.
 
Social Media Information: If you use Facebook to log into Ancestry services, we collect information from your Facebook profile that you consent to provide to us (for example your Facebook profile information).
 
Additional User Information: We collect information that you provide to us when you answer email surveys and online questionnaires offered through the Services.
 
Your Comments and Communications: We collect information in any comments you voluntarily post on our Services. We also collect information you provide when you participate in community discussions, chats, or when you communicate with other members using Ancestry’s messaging platform.

In particular, we will not share your Genetic Information with insurance companies, employers, or third-party marketers without your express consent. The circumstances described below explain when sharing might occur:

Other Ancestry Members:  Any information you add to your Ancestry profile will be seen by other Ancestry members, as will public family tree details (we do not show living people in your tree to other users without your permission), and DNA matches (when you choose to see and be seen by your DNA matches).
Service Providers: We use the services of other companies to help us provide the Services to you. As a result, these partner companies will have some of your information in their systems. Our partners act only at the direction of Ancestry, and are subject to contractual obligations governing data security and confidentiality consistent with this Privacy Statement and applicable laws. These partners include our laboratory partners, DNA test shipping providers, credit card processors, cloud services infrastructure providers, biological sample storage facilities, and vendors that assist us in marketing, analytics, fraud prevention, and Member Support.
Research Partners: We share your Genetic Information with research partners only when you provide us with your express consent to do so through our Informed Consent to Research. By agreeing to the Informed Consent to Research you agree to the specified uses described in that document. Research partners may include commercial or non-profit organizations that conduct or support scientific research or conduct or support the development of therapeutics, medical devices or related material to treat, diagnose or predict health conditions. In some circumstances, a research partner or Ancestry may have a financial interest in the research arrangement. A list of our research partners can be found here.

Comply with valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas, warrants);
Enforce or apply the Ancestry Terms and Conditions;
Protect the security or integrity of the Services; or
Protect the rights, property, or safety, of Ancestry, our employees or users.

If we are compelled to disclose your Personal Information to law enforcement, we will do our best to provide you with advance notice, unless we are prohibited under the law from doing so. In the interest of transparency, Ancestry produces a Transparency Report where we list the number of valid law enforcement requests for user data across all our sites.

If Ancestry is Acquired: In the event that Ancestry or its businesses are acquired or transferred to another entity (in whole or part and including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we will share your Personal Information with that entity. The promises in this Privacy Statement will apply to your Personal Information as transferred to the new entity.

A note about aggregated data: Ancestry may disclose user information in an aggregated form as part of the Services or our marketing, or in scientific publications published by us or our research partners. For example, we might note the percentage of immigrants in a State that are from a particular geographic region or country. Such publications will never include Personal Information.

8.  Security
Ancestry maintains a comprehensive information security program designed to protect our customers’ Personal Information using administrative, physical, and technical safeguards based on the sensitivity of the Personal Information collected.

We use secure server software to encrypt Personal Information (including Genetic Information), and we only partner with security companies that meet and commit to our security standards.

Do-Not-Track Disclosure
 
Ancestry notes that although we do our best to honor your privacy preferences, and have implemented industry standard safeguards as described above, we do not respond to Do-Not-Track signals from your browser at this time due to the lack of an established industry standard.

Also, when Ancestry uses other companies’ services, data, and software tools to target advertising to you, these companies may collect information (such as a unique cookie or mobile identifier) about your online activities over time and across other websites or services on our behalf. Controls to help you manage this type of tracking via advertising are detailed in our Cookie Policy.
