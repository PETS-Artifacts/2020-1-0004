Sonesta Privacy Policy
At Sonesta International Hotels Corporation (Sonesta), we are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personally identifiable information, sometimes referred to as “PII”. We have provided this Privacy Policy as an explanation of the information we collect from you, how we use it, how the use of this information can benefit your experience on our web sites and during your relationship with us, with whom and for what purposes we may share that information, and the choices you can make about our use of the information.
As one of our guests or visitors to our web sites, you understand and agree that we collect, use and disclose your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Please note that personal information which we may receive about you pursuant to relationships with or subject to the instructions of third party business partners such as airlines, car rental companies and other travel providers, tour and package operators and other travel arrangers, or corporate customers may be subject to those third parties' privacy policies or contractual relationships between Sonesta and them.  Please refer to the privacy policies of such third parties to determine their practices with respect to information they collect from you.
Information We Collect and Purpose for Collection
Sonesta collects information about our guests and visitors to our web sites so that we can provide an experience that is responsive to your needs and to enhance our offerings to you and our other customers.  More specifically, we use the information to fulfill bookings and to provide any other specific products, services and information you request from us (such as participation in our loyalty programs), to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it or which we disclose to you at the time of disclosure, to provide to you our newsletter, surveys and other marketing and informational materials regarding our properties, products and services (subject to your opt out right described below) and as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy.
You can always browse our web sites without revealing who you are or providing personal information. When you visit our web sites, we collect information to analyze the usage of the web sites in order to improve the user experience on the sites.  Some of this information is collected with the use of cookies and other technologies – these practices are more fully described below under "Use of Cookies".
Information may be collected as part of responding to a survey, subscribing to our newsletters, making and fulfilling a reservation, registering for our loyalty program, accommodating your personal preferences, updating your contact information, working with third parties, and purchasing products or services. The types of personally identifiable information that we collect may include your name, home, work and e-mail addresses, telephone, mobile telephone, credit card information, gender, and lifestyle information such as room preferences and other information necessary to fulfill special requests (e.g., health conditions that require special room accommodations).
Sonesta may also collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as information regarding your use of our web sites, communication preferences, travel habits and aggregated data relating to your stays.
Please do not include any credit card information in your electronic communication with us unless it is specifically required by us as part of the reservation or transaction fulfillment process on our branded reservation web sites, or our customer contact centers.
Use of Cookies
Sonesta and its third party marketing partners may use cookies, invisible pixels, and web beacons to obtain information about you while visiting our web sites. A cookie is a small text file that is sent to your browser from a server and stored on your computer. Sonesta cookies assign your computer with a unique identifier, which is used to identify you whenever you return to a Sonesta web site.
We use cookies to efficiently customize your experience on our web sites, by using the cookies to remind us of your preferences each time you return to our web pages. Sonesta cookies are not designed to damage any of your files or programs, nor can they read information from other files on your computer hard drive.
Sonesta cookies are limited to our web sites only, and are not designed to follow you on the Internet after leaving Sonesta owned web sites. We track the usage of our web sites in order to better meet your needs and to help make it easier for you to find information in the future.
Sonesta also uses invisible pixels, sometimes called web beacons, to count how many people visit certain web pages. Information collected from invisible pixels is used and reported in the aggregate and does not contain PII. Sonesta may use this information to improve marketing programs and content.
We also work with vendors and marketing partners to help deliver advertisements and personalized content that we believe will be of interest to you. These vendors and other partners include advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, audience segment providers, analytics providers, and other similar providers. These partners and vendors use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your online activity (e.g., the sites and pages you have visited at Sonesta sites and other third party sites) in order to help Sonesta deliver personalized content and advertising to you while you are on other sites, or serve you a follow up email or direct mail after your website visit.
For example, if you go to a Sonesta site to look at one of our properties or to book a hotel room, you may later see an advertisement from us when you visit another web site. We may also engage one of these vendors to deliver our advertisements to consumers whose online behaviors on sites other than the Sonesta sites indicate that they may be interested in travel. In other instances, we engage in special arrangements with certain advertisers with which we think our web site visitors would have an interest.In order to send you an email or direct mail, Sonesta may use third party vendors that match your device to an email address or postal address so we may continue to communicate with you accurately and in accordance with your preferences.
Information Processing and Disclosure
Our practice is to add the information you provide to us to a local or global database operated by us or on our behalf. In the course of processing your information in connection with fulfilling the bookings and providing the other products and services you obtain from us, it may be necessary to transfer your personal information to Sonesta's affiliates, properties within the Sonesta system, payment processors and/or third party service providers located in the United States and throughout the world for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Unless otherwise precluded or governed by legal requirements, Sonesta does not grant permission to any of its affiliates, property owners or third party service providers that may receive your information to use such information independent of use in connection with our products and services, consistent with this policy, although please note that reservations made via our web sites (but not our call centers) are processed by Sabre, Inc., a third party. Personal information disclosed during the reservation process via our web sites will be subject to this Privacy Policy, and, with respect to Sabre’s holding, use and retention of such information, shall be subject to Sabre’s privacy policy (as may be updated from time to time) displayed on Sabre’s website, which is accessible at http://www.sabre.com.
Except for the disclosure noted above regarding affiliates, properties, payment processors and third party service providers, and except as disclosed below, Sonesta's practice is to not provide access to, and not sell, rent, or otherwise give physical possession of your personal information to other parties. Situations in which Sonesta may, without your consent, disclose your information, any communications sent to or received from you, and other information that we may have relating to you, are:
when we have received your consent to do so,
when a hotel or other property leaves the Sonesta system and access to your PII is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations,
to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law, including pursuant to a court order, subpoena, discovery, investigation or similar action;
in case of emergency if we believe it helpful in order to safeguard the life, health, or property of an individual;
if reasonably necessary to protect or enforce our property and rights, including to prevent, investigate, identify persons or organizations potentially involved in, or take any action regarding suspected fraud, violations of our terms of service, or activity that appears to us to be illegal or may expose us to legal liability, and
in the event we merge with, or sell or have a change of control of all or part of our business to a third party, to the acquiror of such business.
If information is shared as mentioned above, we reasonably seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the specific circumstances.
Security
Because the security of your personal information is important to us, we use Secured Socket Layer (“SSL”) software in order to encrypt the personal information that you provide to us. If your browser is SSL enabled (which most are), your transmission of personal information to us online will be encrypted. You can verify whether your personal information is transmitted using SSL encryption by confirming the symbol of a closed lock or solid key in your browser window. You can also verify that your personal information will be encrypted using SSL encryption by making sure that the prefix for the web address listed for that page has changed from “http” to “https”. If you do not see the appropriate symbol and the “https” prefix, you should not assume that the personal information that you are being asked to provide will be encrypted prior to transmission.
The personal information we collect from you online is stored by us and/or our service providers using reasonable protective measures.   Notwithstanding these efforts, security measures cannot prevent all loss, misuse or alteration of personal information; we are not responsible for any damages or liabilities relating to any such incidents.  The security of your information also depends on you.  Please maintain the confidentiality of any of your account or password information that you have with us.  You are responsible for the actions of anyone to whom you give your account or password information.
Links to Other Web sites
In some cases, our web sites contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties over which we have no control. When you connect to such web site, you leave our web site. You should always read the privacy policy on these sites prior to transmitting any personal data since we cannot verify or be responsible for information not maintained by Sonesta International Hotels Corporation. You connect to these sites at your own risk.
Protecting Minor Children
Except as noted below, Sonesta does not seek to obtain nor does it wish to receive PII directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our web sites. If a minor (as defined by applicable law) provides us with his/her data without parental or guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Sonesta marketing communications.  Exceptions to this are (1) the names and ages of minors staying in rooms under reservations booked by an adult, whose names are recorded, and (2) our properties have from time to time programs and services directed at children, such as our "Just for Kids" and similar supervised children's services, for which email, contact information and age may be acquired from minors aged 13 and over (such minimum age subject to appropriate adjustment in each jurisdiction to comply with law).
Opt Out
Our intention is that you should only receive email communications that you request, or that you will find useful. We may periodically contact you to provide information on upcoming or past reservations, Travel Pass account information, general hotel or corporate informational updates, or to ask for your feedback on our service.  This communication is typically via email, though it may be by phone or direct mail (particularly with respect to upcoming reservations).   We may also send promotional emails with special offers that may be of interest to you (unless you have opted out). All of our promotional emails give you the option to opt out at any time by clicking on a link at the bottom of the email. You may also opt out of any future promotional emails by emailing your request to: EMAILOPTOUT@SONESTA.COM. Please allow 10 business days for your email opt out request to take effect.
You may choose not to submit your PII by submitting your request by calling our Compliance Hotline at 855.251.0649. However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.
Additional Information for California Residents

As noted in the introductory section of this privacy policy (here) and in the "Information Processing and Disclosure" section (here), your personal information may be subject to certain third parties' privacy policies.  If you have any questions about our policy and practices, please contact us by electronic mail at compliance@sonesta.com, by telephone at 855.251.0649, or by postal mail at: Sonesta International Hotels Corporation, Chief Compliance Officer, Two Newton Place, 255 Washington Street Suite 300, Newton, MA 02458 USA.
