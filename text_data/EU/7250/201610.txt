The Information We Collect and How We Collect It
How we collect and store information depends on the BroBible Services you use and the devices you use to access the BroBible Services. You can use some of the BroBible Services without providing any information other than that automatically collected as described below.
We may collect information about you during your use of the BroBible Services, including your name, username, password, email address, and information you provide or post on the BroBible Services or allow us to access when you do certain things, such as:

Enter registration information for the BroBible Services;
Enter a sweepstakes or contest or register for a promotion;
Participate in voting or polling activities;
Request certain features (e.g., newsletters);
Sign up to receive SMS (text message) notifications;
Download or use one of our mobile applications;
Connect with the BroBible Services or otherwise allow us to access certain information about you via Facebook and other social networking services (collectively, “social networking services”); or
Post content to or on the BroBible Services.

We may collect and store your user ID associated with the social networking site account that you use to sign in to your BroBible account or connect or use with the BroBible Services. When you sign in to your BroBible account or mobile application with your social networking site account information or otherwise connect to your social networking site account with the BroBible Services, you authorize BroBible to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information available to BroBible through the social networking site interface, including any information that you have made public in connection with your social networking site account, information that the social networking site shares with us, or information that is disclosed as being shared during the sign-in process.
We may also combine information that we collect from you with information we obtain about you from third parties and information derived from any other service we provide.
Please be careful whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose information through the BroBible Services, such as via social networking sites or in comments you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge.
Cookies and Other Electronic Technologies
When you use the BroBible Services, we use persistent and session cookies and other tracking technologies to: (a) store your username and password; (b) analyze the usage of the BroBible Services; (c) customize the BroBible Services to your preferences; and (d) control the advertising displayed by the BroBible Services. We may also use other Internet technologies, such as Flash technologies, Web beacons or pixel tags, and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of the BroBible Services (including to serve you ads when you are on other websites or the Internet when we can access those cookies). We also may include Web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather additional information through other methods.
We use these automated technologies to collect and analyze certain types of information we consider to be non-personal information, including: (a) information related to the devices you use to access or interact with our services, such as: IP addresses, geolocation information (as described further below), unique device identifiers and other information about your mobile phone or other mobile device(s), browser types, browser language; and (b) information related to the ways in which you interact with the BroBible Services, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the BroBible Services, and other similar information. We may also capture other data, such as search criteria and results. In some cases, we will associate this information with a unique BroBible identifier (that cannot be used by itself to identify you) for our internal use, in which case your BroBible identifier will be considered BroBible information and nothing in this Privacy Policy restricts how BroBible may use this information.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of the BroBible Services. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the Global Privacy Settings Panel.
Third Party Advertising and Your Choices
Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the BroBible Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect non-personal information about your use of the BroBible Services. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers) to serve tailored ads to you on the BroBible Services, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the BroBible Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the BroBible Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s website and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance’s website. You also can control advertising cookies from Google, by using its Ads Preference Manager. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the BroBible Services, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising.
Device Location Information
We may collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the BroBible Services), and may use that information to customize the BroBible Services with location-based information, advertising, and features. For example, if you provide a zip code that indicates that you live in Chicago, the BroBible Services may be customized with Chicago-specific information and advertisements. In order to do this, your location information may be passed along to our affiliates, agents, vendors or advertisers. If you access the BroBible Services through a mobile device and you do not want your device to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. See yourdevice manufacturer’s instructions for further details.
What We Do With The Information We Collect
We use the information that we collect for the following purposes:

For the purposes for which you provided it;
To send you information about your relationship or transactions with us;
To send you alerts or other communications;
To notify you about new features of the BroBible Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers;
To administer sweepstakes and contests;
To process and respond to your inquiries;
To contact you with information that we believe will be of interest to you;

To improve the content and features of the BroBible Services or develop new BroBible Services;
To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you see on the BroBible Services;
To enforce the legal terms that govern your use of the BroBible Services; and
To administer and troubleshoot the BroBible Services.

The BroBible Services are supported by advertising revenue. We will send you commercial email on behalf of ourselves, our affiliates, and advertisers. Each such email we send you will have an opt-out that you can use to stop receiving such communications.
We may aggregate and/or anonymize information collected by the BroBible Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated, anonymized, and other non-personal information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We will make your information available to other companies, websites, applications or people in the circumstances described below:

We may rent, sell, or share your information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that you have requested; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with any affiliate or agent of BroBible in order to provide the BroBible Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by those advertisers’, operators’, or sponsors’ privacy policies or practices.
We may disclose your information in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process we receive, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.
We may share your information with third-party advertisers and advertising networks or others with which we have a contractual relationship in aggregated or non-personally identifiable forms. Except when such business partners are acting on our behalf or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will obtain your consent before we share your email address, phone number or street address with them so that they may send you promotional information about their products and services directly.
We may disclose your information when we believe it appropriate in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to the physical safety or property of any person, violations of the Terms of Use for the BroBible Services, and/or to protect our rights and property.

As we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets.  Your information may also be transferred to a trustee or other person in the unlikely event of a bankruptcy or other insolvency event.
How You Can Access and Update Your Information
You may review and update certain user profile information by logging in to the relevant portions of the BroBible Services where such information may be updated (if available) or by contacting us at privacy@wovendigital.com.
How We Protect Information
We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures to protect against the unauthorized access, destruction or alteration of your information. Despite our best efforts, however, no security measures are completely impenetrable.
Linked Sites and Advertisements
The BroBible Services may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those third-party websites.
We have relationships with third-party providers to provide content, products, services, and functionality through the BroBible Services. When you visit sites or use any BroBible Services provided in conjunction with one or more of these third-party providers and the brands of those providers appear on the site or BroBible Services in connection with such content, products, services, or functionality, we may share any information you provide or that is collected during your use of those BroBible Services with those providers. In some cases, the provider may collect information from you directly, in which case the provider’s privacy policy (which may differ from this Privacy Policy) would apply. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of any of our providers, you should contact the provider directly for more information.
Users from Outside the United States
The BroBible Services are hosted in the United States and are governed by United States law. If you are using the BroBible Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our databases are operated. The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the BroBible Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in our Privacy Policy.

BroBible prohibits registration or subscription by, and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from, anyone under 13 years of age.

BroBible reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.

If the material changes concern practices where we have represented that we will obtain your consent to use or disclose your personally identifiable information, we will obtain your consent before taking any action inconsistent with those representations.
