What are "cookies"?
Most Internet sites, including ours, collect data about visitors through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small software programs that help sites recognize repeat visitors by assigning a random number to each desktop for tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. Cookies may be used to "connect" your computer to information stored in a separate location. At Tetris.com, we use cookies to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. Some examples of this information include items added to your shopping cart and user specific information on pages accessed and previous visits to our site. Your information is stored in a safe and secure database.

We do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer. The Tetris Company recognizes that you have a choice to refuse cookies. However, if you wish to purchase from our site, you must accept cookies so that we can securely process your order.

Tetris Shop
Our Tetris Shop is hosted on Shopify Inc.

Shopify stores your data on a secure server behind a firewall.
Payment: 
If you choose a direct payment gateway to complete your purchase on our Tetris Shop, then Shopify stores your credit card data. It is encrypted through the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS). Your purchase transaction data is stored only as long as is necessary to complete your purchase transaction. After that is complete, your purchase transaction information is deleted. 
All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.   PCI-DSS requirements help ensure the secure handling of credit card information by our store and its service providers.
