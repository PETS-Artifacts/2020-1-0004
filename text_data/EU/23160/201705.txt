As a condition to being allowed to download free, trial or evaluation software from this Site, you may be asked for your consent to be contacted from time to time by us and/or one of our affiliates, representatives or partners, by either email, postal mail, telephone and/or facsimile, to provide you with the information about other products and/or services offered by Embarcadero or its affiliates or partners that we or they think may be of interest to you.  In certain cases, your contact information will be provided to the software provider for registration and/or marketing purposes.  You may opt out of such communication at any time by opting out of the use of free AppWave apps, and changing your marketing preference to opt out.  If you elect to opt out of communications from us, Embarcadero at its discretion may cease providing access to or use of the free software.

Embarcadero provides a number of ways for you to "opt-out" of receiving certain additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We may offer you these choices at the time you give us your information. However, the availability of certain offers and services such as downloading trial or evaluation software may be conditioned upon your agreement to permit Embarcadero or our business partners to contact you in order to provide with software keys to run your trial or evalution, in which case, notice of any such condition will appear on this Site.
