HSE Privacy Policy Statement
Our lawful basis for processing your information
HSE’s functions are  set out in the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. In carrying out these  functions, we necessarily collect information on businesses and individuals.  You might also provide us with information by using this website, for example,  by giving us feedback or sending a query or request to us. HSE is registered as  a data controller under the Data Protection Act 2018 and is under a legal duty  to protect any personal information we collect and we will only use that  information in accordance with the law. 
Under the General Data  Protection Regulations (GDPR) Article 6 and Part 3 of the Data Protection Act (Law  Enforcement), the following processing conditions  apply to the personal information HSE process: -

Processing  necessary for the performance of a contract 
Processing  required by law 
Processing  necessary for exercise of official authority or for the performance of a task  carried out in the public interest 
In  specific situations, we can collect and process your data with your consent 

What information do we collect about  you?  
We collect information about you if you are  an employee of HSE; if you report a workplace health and safety problem; are  involved in a workplace health and safety incident; submit a complaint or request  workplace health and safety advice. We also collect information about you when  you subscribe to services; place an order for products and voluntarily provide  feedback. Website usage information is collected using cookies.
How do we obtain this  information?

Information is given to us voluntarily  by you; under a statutory or contractual obligation (e.g. under the RIDDOR legislation) or is  provided to us by other government departments; regulators and enforcing  authorities so we can fulfil our public functions. 
How  will we use information about you and who do we share it with? 

In  order to carry out our functions and respond to enquiries effectively, we will  sometimes need to share information with other government departments, the  emergency services, law enforcement agencies, public authorities (such as local  authorities and the Environment Agency) and organisations acting on our behalf,  and who may be based outside of the EU/EEA.  However, we will only do this where it is permitted by law and where  appropriate controls are in place.
We also  sometimes use other organisations to process personal data on our behalf. Where  we do this, they are required to follow the same rules and information security  requirements as us, and are not permitted to reuse the data for other purposes.
Research is also  undertaken to help meet HSE's business objectives and we may use your information  to help us improve our understanding of health and  safety risks and how to control them. The data will not be used in relation to  decisions that affect individuals. 
There will be other circumstances where we may share your data with third parties who are not a government department or regulatory organisation, for example when you have raised a concern about an organisation but will only do so with your consent.
How do we protect your  information and how long do we keep it?
We  publish a disposal policy (known as the Business Classification Scheme) which explains how  long we keep different types of records and documents for, including records  and documents containing personal data. Personal data is deleted or securely  destroyed at the end of the disposal period.
