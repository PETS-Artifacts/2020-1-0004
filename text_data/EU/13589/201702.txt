PagerDuty Privacy Policy
PagerDuty, Inc. (“PagerDuty” or “we” or “our”) provides an alarm aggregation and dispatching service for system administrators and support teams (“Services”). We have prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our practices regarding the use of information and other data that we collect from our website at https://pagerduty.com (“Website”) and through our Services. For the purpose of this Privacy Policy “Personally Identifiable Information” or “PII” means information that can be used on its own or in combination with other information to identify or contact you, your Users, or your Contact Persons, such as name, phone number and/or e-mail address.
1. Safe Harbor:  PagerDuty complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of PII from European Union member countries and Switzerland. PagerDuty has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view PagerDuty’s certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.
2. User Consent: by submitting or making available information through our Website or Services as described below, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the processing of your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. In connection with providing Services, PagerDuty acts as a data processor, not a data controller. This means that PagerDuty follows your instructions as to how to use your PII. While PagerDuty primarily processes your data on servers located in the United States, your data may also be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries if necessary to do so as part of the Services. The laws in such other countries regarding the use and processing of data may be more or less stringent than the laws in the United States or your country. For example, when an alarm trigger set by you occurs, the Services will automatically retrieve the Contact Information supplied by you and use the method(s) you established to contact the applicable Contact Person. This will require telephoning or sending an email or SMS message or using other means to contact such Contact Person wherever they are located, which may not be the United States or your home country. Of necessity this means PII will be transmitted in or through the networks, servers, telephone system and so forth in the country where the Contact Person is located. You consent, and hereby authorize and assume responsibility, for PagerDuty to use your data in this manner as part of offering the Services.
3. What Data We Collect:
a. Information Provided by Visitors: If you visit our Website or use our Services, we may collect PII from you, including, but not limited to, first and last name, organization name, e-mail address and password if you decide to register to receive information, schedule a demo, or create an account to sue the Services. If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail (e.g., in response to an employment opportunity posted on our website), we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to send you a reply, and any information that you submit to us, such as a resume.
b. Information that We may Collect via Technological Means:
Our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect data from you, such as browser type, operating system, IP address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Like most Internet services, we automatically gather this data and store it in log files each time you visit our website or access your account on our network.  We may also directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service.  These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service.  We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual User.
 
We also use various technical mechanisms such as cookies, pixels, clear GIFS and so forth to monitor how you are using our website and Services. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may link the information we store in cookies or through other mechanisms to the personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our website. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. You can also disable all cookies on your Internet browser. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly. The use of cookies and other mechanisms by our partners, affiliates or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement as we do not have access or control over them.
c. Information that we may collect from our Customers:
If you decide to purchase the Services and become a PagerDuty customer (“Customer”), we will need to collect additional information from you.
First, we – or our third-party credit card or payment processor on our behalf – will collect your payment information, such as a credit card number or account information. All of this is your PII.
Second, you will need to set up your profile to be able to use the Services. This includes, among other things, telling us how to contact you or your organization when faults are detected by the organization’s monitoring tools, and creating accounts for the on-call engineers on your team.  You will be able to set up your preferred contact methods (e.g., phone, SMS, email and/or push notifications) and you will be required to provide the applicable contact information (“Contact Information”), parts of which will also be PII.  If you or your Users are supplying PII for Contact Persons, your represent and warrant that you have the right to provide such information.
4. How We Use the Data We Collect:
We use PII for two basic purposes: to provide and improve the Website and to provide and improve the Services.
In particular, we use Contact Information to send alerts to Customers in accordance with the Customer’s notification rules and schedule.
We may also use PII to facilitate the creation of and secure your account on our network; identify you as a User in our system; provide improved administration of our Website and Services; improve the quality of experience when you interact with our Website and Services; respond to your inquiries related to employment opportunities or other requests; send promotional communications; provide you with hardcopy or electronic newsletters, or surveys; send upgrades and special offers related to our Services and related services and for other marketing purposes of PagerDuty, should you request to receive such communications from us; make telephone calls to you, from time to time, as a part of secondary fraud protection or to solicit your feedback. We may also analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of the Website and Services or improve their respective functionalities, or for other business purposes.
5. When We May Disclose Data:
We may share your data with third parties as part of providing the Services. This will include, among other things, to provide technical support, to process payments, and to contact your organization when an alarm is triggered. Third parties may include, among others, payment processors, technical support organizations, server and network hosts, telephone and messaging operators, and other telecommunications organizations.
Regardless of any choices you make regarding your PII (as described below), PagerDuty may disclose PII if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of PagerDuty or users of the Services or related services.
We may also share any information collected under this Privacy Policy in connection with any merger, sale of assets, financing, acquisition, or in any other situation where used information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets, provided that the new provider has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own.
We may share aggregate or anonymous data (including personal data that has been stripped of personally identifying characteristics) with third parties as part of providing our Service.
Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, share, or rent the PII collected from our Services or the Website to third parties other than as outlined in this policy. You expressly consent to the sharing of your PII as described in this Privacy Policy.
6. Your Choices:
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your PII.
a. Opt-Out: We may periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site or the purchase of our Services. When you receive newsletters or promotional communications from us, you may indicate a preference to stop receiving further communications from us and you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your account or by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). Notwithstanding your indicated  preferences, when applicable we will send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy, and other communications that directly affect your status as a user of our site or Services.
b. Ability to Edit or Delete Personal Information:  You may edit any of your PII in your account, including Contact Information (and/or notification rules), by editing your profile. You may also request that we delete your account information by sending an email to support@pagerduty.com, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements). We will respond to such requests within 30 days. When we delete or edit account information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. We will otherwise retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services as well as is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
7. Information Processed under the Direction of Customers:
As described above, PagerDuty processes Contact Information under the direction of the applicable PagerDuty Customer (data controller) and has no direct relationship with the individuals (e.g., IT Personnel) whose personal data it processes.  Any individual who seeks access, or who seeks to edit or delete inaccurate Contact Information should direct his or her query to the applicable customer. It is the customer’s responsibility to edit or delete (or have edited or deleted) such Contact Information as set forth above.
8. Security of Your Data:
PagerDuty is committed to protecting the security of your PII. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your PII from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. Please do not disclose your account password to unauthorized people. Despite these measures, you should know that PagerDuty cannot fully eliminate security risks associated with PII and mistakes and security breaches may happen. If you have any questions about security on our Website, you can contact us at the information below.
9. Links to Third Party Sites:
Our provision of a link to any other website or location is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such other website or location or its contents. When you click on such a link, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party may collect data, including PII, from you.
We have no control over, do not review, and cannot be responsible for, these outside websites or their content. Please be aware that the terms of this Privacy Policy do not apply to these outside websites or content, or to any collection of data after you click on a link to a third party. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any other website you visit.
