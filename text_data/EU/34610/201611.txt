Gamesxl.com, a part of Admeen B.V., is responsible for the processing of the data. In this privacy statement, we explain which personal data we collect and use, and for what purpose. Because our processing falls within the statutory exemption schemes, it has not been reported to the Dutch Data Protection Authority.

In order to cancel an account / a profile the Parent should have access to the email address associated with the account to be deleted.

By clicking on the link a specially designed page on Gamesxl.com  is opened. On this page a number of data of the Parent and of the profile to be removed are displayed. Here, the Parent should fill in additional information, such as a name, address and telephone number. When the data are sent, an email message will be sent to the email address associated with the account / profile to be deleted. The Parent will have to open this email message containing a link to disable/remove the account.
