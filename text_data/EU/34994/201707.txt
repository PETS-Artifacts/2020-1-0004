What does LexCom know about you, what do you permit to LexCom and the LexCom
users and how are your personal data handled?
3.1
Registration information
The functional design of the LexCom software and the LexCom web
services requires that LexCom collects certain personal data from you as your registration
information during the registration process and processes these. In the first
place, these are the following data:
·        
Company ID / ID (this does not
apply for the LexCom software agroparts)
·        
Username
·        
Password
The administrator of a company ID may create further users and hence
view the company ID / ID of these users. These data can never be viewed by any
other LexCom user at any point of time. LexCom will never pass on these data to
any third party and/or disclose them to such third parties in any other way.
Furthermore, you need to fill in certain mandatory fields during
registration, for example, your first name, last name, the name of your company
and your e-mail address (the mandatory fields of the LexCom web services may differ).
In addition, you may enter optional information which you may edit or delete
later at any time.
3.2
Payment data
LexCom collects and uses your payment data such as credit card or bank
details for the purpose of payment handling and accounting as necessary for the
selected mode of payment. Your payment data are submitted - to the necessary
extent - to service providers such as credit card institutions or may be
collected directly and processed by these for the purpose of handling the
payment transaction. Your payment data are stored in order to enable payment
handling and accounting for the automatic extension of the subscription. The
collection of payment data does not apply for the LexCom web service agroparts.
4.
Cookies and Pixel Tags
Cookies are small files which enable us to store on your PC or other
terminal device some specific information related to you as a user while you
are using the LexCom web services. For example, cookies help us to determine
the frequency of use and the number of actual users of our web services,
analyse the user behaviour on our web site, assess the publicity effectiveness,
increase security and design our web services so that they are as convenient,
efficient and interesting for you as possible. Only you and LexCom have access
to these cookies, which are used for the purposes described below.
When you log in (with your user name and password), the LexCom web
services utilize session cookies for your identification during the time of
your visit. Session cookies expire automatically on termination of your
session. The session cookies contain part of your login data. However,
automatic login on two different computers is not possible in this case.
In addition, the LexCom web services use permanent cookies. These
cookies store information about users accessing the LexCom web services
repeatedly (for example company ID, user name, language, time stamp of previous
access). The purpose of these permanent cookies is, on the one hand, to present
you the specific web service in the correct language even before you have
logged in. On the other hand, this enables you to return directly to your
previous session if you did not log out at the end of your previous session to
the LexCom web service. There is no individual profile generation about your
user behaviour by means of the cookies set by us.
Under certain circumstances you may disable the storage of cookies or
restrict this to specific web sites in your browser or set your browser to
notify you as soon as a cookie is sent. You may also delete cookies from your
terminal device at any time. However, please note that the use of LexCom web
services is not possible if user cookies are rejected.
We utilize pixel tags, web beacons, clear GIFs or similar mechanisms
("pixels"). A pixel tag is an image file or a link to an image file
which is inserted in the code of the web page but not stored on your terminal
device (e.g. computer, smart phone, etc.). Pixel tags enable us, for example,
to count the number of users visiting our web pages after clicking online advertisements.
Thus, pixel tags help us optimize the efficiency of our web pages, revise and
optimize our offers and publicity activities. Our use of pixel tags does not
involve any reference to any person. Personalized tracking does not occur,
either. Pixel tags usually work in conjunction with cookies. If you turn off
cookies, the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit.
5. Log
Files
Whenever you log in to the LexCom software or the LexCom web services,
access data are saved in a log file. Some of the data stored are the company
ID, user name, session ID and the login time.
On the one hand, LexCom needs these log data to detect and correct any
technical problems such as, for example, defective links or program bugs, i.e.
to improve and develop the LexCom software and LexCom web services. On the
other hand, LexCom needs these log data to detect any illegal and/or improper
use of the LexCom software or LexCom web services. For this reason, LexCom
reserves the right to use the log data if there is evidence that users make use
of the LexCom software and/or LexCom web services illegally or contrary to the
contract. This serves to protect the LexCom users, the security of their user
data and LexCom itself.
