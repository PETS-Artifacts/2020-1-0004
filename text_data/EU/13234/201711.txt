How Google uses data when you use this site
Many websites use Google technologies to improve their content and keep it free. When you visit a website that uses Google advertising products (like AdSense), social products (like the +1 button) or analytics tools (Google Analytics), your web browser automatically sends certain information to Google. This includes, for example, the web address of the page that you're visiting and your IP address. They may also set cookies on your browser, or read cookies that are already there.
Similarly, apps that partner with Google can send Google information such as the name of the app and an identifier that helps Google to determine which ads we've served to other apps on your device.
How Google use the information sent by your browser
When you visit websites or use apps that use Google technologies, Google may use the information they receive from those websites and apps to, for example:
• Make ads more effective
• Provide reports of ads activity to advertisers and websites hosting the ads, and to ensure payment to those website publishers
• Help website and app owners using Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps
• Improve your Google+ experience
• Detect and defend against fraud and other security risks to protect users and partners
• Meet there legal duties
• Improve there products
How you can control the information sent to Google
For tips and advice on staying safe and managing your data online, visit the Google Safety Center.
Here are some of the ways you can control the information that is shared by your web browser when you visit or interact with Google services on partners' sites across the web:
• Ads Settings helps you control the ads by Google that you see across the web. You can learn how ads are selected for you, opt out of certain categories and block specific advertisers. Learn more about advertising.
• Many sites across the web use Google Analytics to understand how visitors engage with their sites or apps. If you don’t want Analytics to be used in your browser, you can install the Google Analytics browser add-on. Learn more about Google Analytics and privacy.
• Google makes it easy for you to make recommendations for your friends - for example, by clicking the +1 button on content you like. Some of your +1s may show your name and Google+ profile photo in ads, but you can opt out if you don't want to appear in ads. You can also visit the +1 tab on your Google+ profile to review and manage all of your +1's. Learn more about how to get to your +1 tab.
• Incognito mode in Chrome allows you to browse the web without recording webpages and files in your browser history. Cookies are deleted after you've closed all of your incognito windows and tabs, and your bookmarks and settings are stored until you delete them. Learn more about cookies.
Policy requirements for Google Analytics Advertising Features
Google Analytics Advertising Features allow you to enable features in Analytics that aren't available through standard implementations. Advertising features include:
• Remarketing with Google Analytics
• Google Display Network Impression Reporting
• Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting
• Integrated services that require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers
By enabling the Advertising Features, you enable Google Analytics to collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation. Regardless of how you send data to Google Analytics (for example, via the Google Analytics tracking code, Google Analytics SDK, or the Measurement Protocol), if you use Google Advertising Features, you must adhere to this policy.
You will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising product or feature unless you have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.
If you've enabled any Google Analytics Advertising features, you are required to notify your visitors by disclosing the following information in your privacy policy:
• The Google Analytics Advertising Features you've implemented.
• How you and third-party vendors use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and third-party cookies (such as Google advertising cookies) or other third-party identifiers together.
• How visitors can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features you use, including through Ads Settings, Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (for example, the NAI's consumer opt-out).
We also encourage you to point users to Google Analytics' currently available opt-outs for the web.
European Union user consent policy
When using Google Analytics Advertising Features, you must also comply with the European Union User Consent Policy.
Interest-based advertising
If you've enabled interest-based advertising, including Remarketing, with Google Analytics in connection with other Google services, you must follow the policies applicable to those Google services (like the Google AdWords Policy for Advertising Based on Interests and Location and its sensitive category restrictions, and the DoubleClick Services Platform Program Policies). If you use Google Analytics to collect sensitive information about your visitors, as described in the Google AdWords sensitive category restrictions, you may not use Google Analytics to collect data for the purpose of interest based advertising.
Because laws across countries and territories vary, and because Google Analytics can be used in many ways, Google is unable to provide the exact language you need to include in your privacy policy. Only you understand the unique aspects and special considerations of your business, and your privacy policy should account for this information that only you can provide.
