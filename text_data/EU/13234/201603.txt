CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION
When you book a holiday on-line, we offer the use of secure software that encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. The use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology means that all personal information, such as your credit card number will be encrypted as it travels from your computer to the Sunway Holidays on-line booking engine. When received, the information is decrypted and processed in the same way as a normal credit card transaction by telephone. If your browser supports SSL, and if you entered our site via our secure server access, then transmission of any sensitive data would be protected.
If your browser does not support SSL we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version of any browser to enhance the security of further transactions, otherwise transmission of your personal data may not be protected and Sunway Holidays disclaims any responsibility in this regard. We have taken all reasonable steps to have in place appropriate security measures to protect your information.
