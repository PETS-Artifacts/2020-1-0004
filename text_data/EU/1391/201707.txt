Agreement to Terms of Privacy Policy and Terms of UseAny Prezi Service you wish to use is purely voluntary. You are not required to provide any personal information to us unless you choose to access features of the Service which require such information. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy or Prezi’s Terms of Use related to the Prezi Service, then please do not provide us with personal information, exit this website immediately, and discontinue using the site or any component of the Service. Prezi’s Terms of Use, and your end user license agreement related to any software provided by Prezi that you download and install, are expressly incorporated into this policy by reference and made a part of this policy. By using the Prezi Service, you signify that you agree to the terms of this privacy policy as well as to our Terms of Use.3. Effective Date of And Changes To Privacy PolicyThis privacy policy is effective as of January 24th 2010, and will remain in effect except with respect to any of its provisions that are changed in the future, in which case the changes will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted to the website or we otherwise notify you of the changes. Use of information we collect is subject to the policy in effect at the time such information was collected. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time and you should check this privacy policy periodically. Your continued use of the Service after we post any such modifications will constitute your acknowledgment of the modified policy and your agreement to abide and be bound by the modified policy. We will also revise the “last updated” date found at the beginning of this privacy policy when we post changes to it.4. Policy Applicable To Online Activities OnlyThe privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the internet, and therefore beyond Prezi’s control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. This privacy policy only applies to information collected through the Prezi Service and otherwise as described in this policy.5. Personal Information About You5.1 Types of Information CollectedWe may ask you for certain information, referred to as “personal information,” which includes information that pertains to your identity. Such information may include, but is not limited to, items such as your name, email address, and credit card billing information.5.2 Personal Information You Provide to UsYou may be required to provide personal information to access or use certain parts or features of the Prezi Service. For example, you will be asked to provide your name and a valid email address to establish an account at http://prezi.com. If you wish to establish a paid Prezi account, you will also be asked (in some cases) to provide credit card account and billing information. If you do not provide the requested personal information, you may not be able to access or use the particular component of the Service where such information is required.5.3 Survey InformationFrom time to time, Prezi may ask its registered users to participate in surveys. These surveys are purely optional and help us improve the Prezi Service and provide aggregate information which we think may interest our registered users and visitors. We may use the information that you voluntarily provide as part of your survey response in the manner outlined in this Privacy Policy. In addition, if you choose to participate in a Prezi survey, any information you provide to us, including personal information, will be linked with your account in our system and to any personal information contained therein. We may also use the information you provide in the aggregate to help us generate statistics regarding use of the Prezi Service. For example, if you reveal in a survey response that you are a teacher, Prezi will know that you are a teacher, will retain that information in association with your registered user account, and may publish aggregate statistics based thereon (for example, statistics regarding what portion of our educational users are teachers versus what portion of our educational users are students). If you would not like your information to be used in this way, please do not participate in Prezi surveys or, if participating, please provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance with this Privacy Policy.6.
