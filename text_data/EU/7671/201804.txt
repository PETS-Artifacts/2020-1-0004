What are Cookies
Most websites you visit will use cookies to improve your user experience by enabling that website to remember you, either for the duration of your visit (using a 'session cookie') or for future visits (using a 'persistent cookie').
A cookie is a simple text file that is issued to your computer when you visit a website and which stores and sometimes tracks information about your use of a website. Each cookie is unique to your browser. It will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier, the website name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what's in your shopping basket.
All cookies used by SportPursuit are 'first party' cookies. This means that any cookie set on the Website or Application can only be read back from the Website or Application. No other website or application is able to read or access information from any cookie set by the Website or Application.
Cookies are not programs and therefore cannot contain viruses or other malicious software.
How We Use Cookies
You can find a summary of the various types of cookies we use below. Our cookies are used for 3 types of purpose:


Strictly Necessary Cookies
These cookies are essential to enable you to move around the Website or Application and use their respective features. Without these cookies you cannot for example log into the Website or Application to access our sales. These cookies are passed under HTTPS in an encrypted format. This provides the most security when identifying you as a user.




Performance Cookies
These cookies let us monitor how the Website and Application are performing. These cookies do not let us identify users. We use this information to maintain, operate and continually improve the user experience for our users on the Website or Application.
For example, these cookies allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages and understand how well these pages work for our users.
We also use Google Analytics. Google Analytics is a system used by many websites to record information about who visits a website. Google sets five different cookies with expiry dates ranging from 1 day to 2 years. These cookies are used mainly to differentiate between first time visitors to a website and repeat visitors. They do not contain any personally identifiable information. You can find out more about how Google uses cookies at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html and also see further information in the table below.

record information about choices you've made and allow us to tailor the Website or Application to you, such as by customising elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the Website or Application;


remember that you have visited us before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive. This allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get;


collect anonymous statistical information about how you use the Website or Application (including how long you spend on the Website or Application) and where you have come to the Website or Application from, so that we can improve the Website or Application and learn which parts and which functions of the Website and Application are most popular with users;


gather information about the pages on the Website that you visit or the functions of the Application you use, and also other information about other websites that you visit, so as to place you in a “market segment”.
