                                                used in this Policy, (us, we, our, ours, etc.) these provisions are referring
                                                to Company. Additionally, when the terms "The Site" or "Site" are used,
                                                these terms refer to the websites listed at the beginning of this policy.
                                                
                                                2.You, the User - As the user of this site, this policy will refer to the user
                                                as "you" or through any second-person pronouns, such as "yours," etc.
                                                Hereinafter, the user of the site shall be referred to in applicable second-

B. This Privacy Policy describes how we use information received about you when
                                                you visit our Site or when you subscribe to, or otherwise use our online services.
                                                This Policy does not cover any information that we may receive from or about
                                                you through channels other than through the use of the Site.
                                                
II. Revisions to this Policy
                                                We reserve the right to revise, amend, or modify this policy and our other policies
                                                and agreements at any time and in any manner. You should periodically check for any
                                                modifications of this Policy by re-visiting this web page and using the "refresh" button
                                                on your browser. You should note the date of last revision to this Policy, which appears
                                                at the top of this Policy. If the "last modified" date remains unchanged after you have -1- clicked the "refresh" button on your browser, you may presume that no changes have
                                                been made since the last reading of the policy. A changed "last modified" dates indicates
                                                that this Policy has been updated or edited, and the updated or edited version supersedes
                                                any prior versions immediately upon posting.

VIII. Public Forums and Other Public Areas:
A. Public Forums  We may offer forums or other interactive features on the Site.
                                                We may also provide services that allow Members or Browsers to post messages or
                                                comments to the public. Any and all information posted to the Site, whether as a
                                                comment to a video or any other post, should immediately be considered to be public
                                                information.
                                                B.  Any information or content you voluntarily provide to Us should be considered
                                                public. You may have the opportunity to provide additional information or content
                                                that is not required for registration to the Site, and your voluntary provision of such
                                                information is solely your decision.
                                                IX. Our Commitment to Data Security.
                                                We take measures to protect the transmission of all sensitive end-user information.
                                                We make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems.
                                                Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-
                                                party 'hackers' from illegally obtaining this information. We take all reasonable
                                                measures to prevent such breaches of security, but given the resourcefulness of cyber-
                                                criminals we are unable to guarantee that our security is 100% breach-proof. You
                                                assume the risk of such breaches to the extent that they occur despite our reasonable
                                                security measures.
                                                X. How to Access or Modify Your Information.

                                                during registration. To access or modify such information, contact our Customer Service
                                                Department at youjizzadmin(at)gmail.com.
                                                XI. Where to Direct Questions About Our Privacy Policy.
                                                If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the practices described herein, you
