The Cloudinary Privacy Policy



The Identifiable Information That You Provide


If you register with the Service through our website at: www.cloudinary.com, we will ask you to provide personal information, including your name, your company name, your email address and password.


As a paying user of the Service, we will receive your payment transaction details (for example, your name, the amount paid and the date of payment), from the payment service provider that processed your payment.


When you contact us, or when we contact you, we may receive and process any personal information that you provide us.



The Identifiable Information That We Collect


When you access the Service, our servers log certain 'traffic/session' information from your device, such as your user agent and the Internet Protocol (IP) address.


When you use the Service, we collect information about your Service activity, for example your log-in and log-out time, the duration of Service sessions, the content uploaded and downloaded, viewed web-pages or specific content on web-pages, activity measures and geo-location.



The Identifiable Information That You Upload


The content you upload to the Service, whether from your own device or from a cloud-based hosting service, including any data, text, graphic, audio and audio-visual files, may include personal information. Based on your preferences, the uploaded content may be accessible to others.


Please use caution when uploading the content, and avoid any involuntary disclosure of your personal information or disclosure of others' personal information without their consent.



What Do We Do With Identifiable Information?


We use the personal information we collect and receive to provide the Service to you and to other users, to enable the Service's tools and features, to study and analyze the functionality of the Service and users' activities, to provide support, to measure Service activity for pricing purposes, to maintain the Service, to make it better and to continue developing the Service.


We may use your email address to contact you when necessary, to send you reminders and to provide you information and notices about the Service. We may include commercial and marketing information.


We obey the law and expect you to do the same. If necessary, we may use your identifiable information to enforce our terms, policies and legal agreements, to comply with court orders and warrants, and assist law enforcement agencies, to collect debts, prevent fraud, misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Service, and to take any action in any legal dispute and proceeding.



Sharing Identifiable information with others


We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information. We may share your identifiable information with service providers and other third parties, if necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting the information.


For example we will share your payment transaction details with the payment services providers, to process and verify your payments. We may use a service provider to manage our email messages transmission.


We may also share personally identifiable information with companies or organizations connected, or affiliated with us, such as subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their use of such information must comply with this policy.


We may report any Contributed Content and share user identifiable information, if we believe, in our sole discretion that such content is illegal or abusive or may violate any third party rights.


Additionally, a merger, acquisition or any other structural change may require us to transfer your personal information to another entity, provided that the receiving entity will comply with this policy.



Aggregated and Analytical Information


We may use standard analytics tools. The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies and they may use their own cookies to provide their service (for further information about cookies, please see the 'Cookies' section in this policy).


We use the standard analytics tools of Google Analytics and we may use additional or other analytics tools, from time to time. The privacy practices of these tools are subject to their own privacy policies. See Google Analytics Privacy Policy at: http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html.


We use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information and may share it with our partners for legitimate business purposes. It has no effect on your privacy, because there is no reasonable way to extract data from the aggregated information that can be associated with you. We will share your identifiable information only subject to the terms of this policy, or subject to your prior consent.



Choice


At any time, you may unsubscribe our mailing lists or newsletters, by sending us an opt-out request to: support@cloudinary.com.


At any time you may disable your account through your account page.


We request and collect minimal personal details that we need for the purposes described in this policy. At any time you may opt to terminate your use of the Service. Thereafter, we will stop collecting any personal information from you. However, we may store and continue using or making available certain personal information that is related to you. For further information, please read the Data Retention section in this policy.


Some web browsers offer a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal. A DNT signal is a HTTP header field indicating your preference for tracking your activities on the Service or through cross-site user tracking. Our Service does not respond to DNT signals.



Accessing Your Personal Information


At any time you may contact us at: support@cloudinary.com and request to access the identifiable information that we keep about you. We may need to ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim you are. If you find that the information on your account is not accurate, complete or updated, then please provide us the necessary information to correct it.



Data Retention


We retain different types of information for different periods, depending on the purposes for processing the information, our legitimate business purposes as well as pursuant to legal requirements under the applicable law.


For example, we may need to keep the information about the payment transactions that you made for several years due to tax related requirements, for accounts settling, record keeping, archiving and legal issues.


We may keep aggregated non-identifiable information without limitation, and to the extent reasonable we will delete or de-identify potentially identifiable information, when we no longer need to process the information.


In any case, as long as you use the Service, we will keep information about you, unless we are required by law to delete it, or if we decide to remove it at our discretion.



Transfer of data outside your territory


Cloudinary is a web-based service. We may store and process information in various sites throughout the globe, including in sites operated and maintained by cloud based service providers. If you are a resident in a jurisdiction where transfer of your personal information to another jurisdiction requires your consent, then you provide us your express and unambiguous consent to such transfer.



Cookies


Cookies are packets of information sent to your web browser and then sent back by the browser each time it accesses the server that sent the cookie.


Some cookies are removed when you close your browser session. These are the "Session Cookies". Some last for longer periods and called "Persistent Cookies".


We use both types. We use Persistent Cookies to remember your log-in details and make it easier for you to log-in the next time you access the Service. We may use this type of cookies and Session Cookies for additional purposes, to facilitate the use of the Service's features and tools.


Every browser allows you to manage your cookies preferences. Please bear in mind that disabling cookies may complicate or even prevent you from using the Service.



Information Security


We and our hosting services implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information.


These measures provide sound industry standard security. However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that the Service will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.



Changes to this Privacy Policy


From time to time, we may update this policy. If the updates have minor if any consequences, they will take effect 7 days after we post a notice on the Service's website. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days after our notice was initially posted.


Until the new policy takes effect, you can choose not to accept it and terminate your use of the Service. Continuing to use the Service after the new policy takes effect means that you agree to the new policy. Note that if we need to adapt the policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective immediately or as required.
