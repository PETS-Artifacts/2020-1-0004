The +1 button lets you publish information worldwide. Via the Google +1 button, you and other users receive personalized content from Google and our partners. Google stores both the information that you entered for a piece of content +1 as well as information concerning the page you were visiting when you clicked on +1. Your +1's can be shown as tips together with your profile name and photo in Google services, such as search results or your Google profile, or in other places on websites and in ads on the Internet.
Google records information on your +1 activities to improve Google services for you and others. To be able to use the Google +1 button, you need a globally visible, public Google profile that must contain at least the name chosen for the profile. This name is used in all Google services. In some cases, this name can also replace another name that you have used when sharing content via your Google account. The identity of your Google profile can be displayed to users who know your e-mail address or have other identifying information about you. In addition to the above-described uses, the information you provide is used in accordance with the applicable Google data protection/privacy policies. Google may publish aggregate statistics regarding the +1 activities of users or disclose these to users and partners, such as publishers, advertisers or associated websites.
