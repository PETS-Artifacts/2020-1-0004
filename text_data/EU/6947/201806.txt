Personal data must be processed in accordance with specific principles set out in data protection law. These include the principle that personal data should be processed ‘lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner’.  In order to comply with this principle, the University will tell you how it will deal with your information at the time we collect it.  This information is normally set out in a “privacy notice”.
We have separate privacy notices for the different categories of people the University processes information about, for example, for students, staff, alumni, visitors etc.  These are published on our website, and there are links to them on this page.
In addition to the privacy notices, more information is set out below, in particular “Your rights as a data subject” and “Exercising your rights, queries and complaints”.
We also process your data in accordance with our Data Protection Policy. This can be found here but it will be updated once the Data Protection Act 2018 is finalised and comes into force.
