6. COMPETITIONS AND PRIZES

When you upload Content for entry into one of our photo challenges, the Photocrowd.com team may, after the closing date for the relevant challenge, act as resident judges and experts to determine a shortlist of finalists. This shortlist of finalists will then be provided to any guest or external judge/expert (as advertised in the relevant challenge) to select the winner and runners up of the relevant competition. In all cases the published rules of the challenge will apply and the judge’s decision is final and binding.  After expert judging (or crowd voting, as the case may be) to select winners has finished, the prize winners will be notified  by email to the winning user’s email account. To be confirmed as a winner and to be awarded the prize, the winning user may be required to confirm full legal ownership of the winning Content and, where applicable, that the winning Content was first created during the relevant challenge period. Should a prize notification or prize addressed to a particular user be returned as undeliverable, we will not resend the notice (whether by the same or another method), research the user's address or make any further attempts at delivery or contact. Where a winner's shipping address is located in a country or area designated by Photocrowd.com, in its sole discretion, as undeliverable, we reserve the right to provide a cash payment sent via PayPal or voucher of equal value to the advertised prize instead of the specific advertised prize. Prizes are not transferable.
Winners will be announced after the confirmation required above is received and the respective winner(s) are confirmed. Photocrowd.com reserves the right to announce prize winners collectively, one at a time, or in any order or clusters as it deems appropriate, in its discretion, except that the winner of expert-judged or crowd-rated prizes will be announced within thirty (30) days of the date on which the confirmation required above is received from the winner. The dispatch of prizes to winners will be the sole responsibility of  the prize sponsor. Prizes are subject to change at any time without notice in the sole discretion of Photocrowd.com or the challenge sponsor. 
By entering into any Photocrowd.com photo challenge, each user releases and holds harmless Photocrowd.com, and any participating prize providers (as well as any of their respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agencies), against any and all claims, demands and liabilities arising out of or relating to the challenge, the user's participation in the challenge and/or any challenge-related activity, including, without limitation, from the winner's use or misuse of a prize or any portion thereof. Prizewinners assume all liability for any injury or damage caused, or claimed to be caused, by participation in any Photocrowd.com competition and/or use/redemption of any prize.  We will not be liable for the actions or omissions of third party challenge sponsors or organisers, even if the challenge  is promoted on our website. 
7. INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide Photocrowd.com with the following information and we will investigate promptly:
•   an electronic or physical signature of the owner or person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of the copyright or other intellectual property right
•   a description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been infringed
•   a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the site, with enough detail that we may find it on the website (in most circumstances, we will need a URL)
•   your address, telephone number and email address
•   a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorised by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent or the law

The terms of this clause shall not prevent any liability or claim for death or bodily injury nor any claim arising from wilful default or gross negligence on our part. 
We undertake from time to time to use reasonable efforts to give you access to our website and Services.  We reserve the right to, at our sole discretion and when we deem necessary due to technical, operational, maintenance or security reasons, take measures which may affect the accessibility of our website and Services.  Due to the nature of Internet and server provision, downtime and lost transmissions may occur and accordingly we will have no liability to you for the loss of any Content or for any deterioration or damage to any Content or any failure of our website or Services.
10. ENDING THIS AGREEMENT

Photocrowd.com may terminate or suspend any and all of its Services and/or your Photocrowd.com account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms.

Upon termination of your account we will  use all reasonable endeavours to remove all Content posted to your account.  If Content is removed, then any third party uses then existing will still remain and we will still be able to grant rights of use for: (i) Content relating to a specific use that has already been downloaded by a Customer for the purpose of such specific use prior to removal, or in respect of which we had entered into negotiations with any Customer prior to the date of removal, for a period of one year following removal, (ii) Content that is being re-used by a Customer, if we reasonably believe that the re-use is the same or very closely similar to the previous use.  In addition, where Content has been entered in a challenge and been given an award or an expert image review, a copy of that will be retained on the site as part of the archive for that photo challenge, or in connection with the expert image review. You will ensure that following termination you will not enter into any arrangement which conflicts with any rights of use granted by us.
11. CHANGING THESE TERMS

Photocrowd.com reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Photocrowd.com website. What constitutes a material change will be determined by us. You shall be responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any such modifications. Using any service or viewing any Content following notification of a material change to the Terms shall constitute your acceptance of the Terms as modified.

Where you have consented to the grant of rights of use in and to the Content to Customers we will account to you for any net royalties.  'Net royalties' means the gross income derived from the exploitation of the grant of use, less (i) our commission, at the rates advised to you from time to time, (ii) any amounts deducted by agents, distributors or sub-licensees (if applicable), (iii) any costs of sales, such as payment to third party printers, and (iv) sales tax (if applicable).  The net royalties you receive may vary depending on the subscription tier that you purchase.  Where you change subscription tiers it may take a little time to put the new royalty rate in place.  Arrangements for payment of any amounts due to you will be as advised to you from time to time.


You agree that we have the right to use your Content fully or partially for promotional reasons and in promotional/marketing material and activity without charge or prior consent or approval from you at our sole discretion and to distribute and redistribute your Content to other parties, websites, applications, and other entities, provided we use reasonable endeavours to ensure that such Content is attributed to you in accordance with the information submitted to us by you.

We offer the facility to sign up to a number of subscription plans, including plans with differing tiers, conditions, limitations and features.

You can upgrade, downgrade or cancel your pricing plan using your online account on the website.  If you are signing up to a subscription plan you must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be advised by us from time to time ("Payment Method").  We will bill the subscription fee, and any applicable taxes such as value added tax, to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each subscription period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method.  Where you change your plan during a subscription period, we may bill you any difference between the subscription fee for your old and new plans for the remainder of that period.  The amount billed for the subscribed plan is a recurring amount which will only be varied in the event that you change your plan or we adjust the prices.  Where the applicable subscription fee is varied, you authorise us to charge your Payment Method for such varied amounts.
We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service in our sole discretion. Any price changes will take effect no earlier than 30 days following notice to you.

•   the Content may not be sublicensed, resold or otherwise made available for use or distribution separately or detached from a product or web page. For example, the Content may be used as an integral part of a web page design, but may not be made available for downloading separately or in a format designed or intended for permanent storage or re-use by website users.

To order a product you will need to follow the ordering procedures set out on our order page. Details of our prices for the Products, and the procedures for payment and delivery are displayed on our web site.  Any times or dates stated on our web site for delivery are estimates only. We or our providers will make all reasonable effort to deliver goods within the time specified, but do not accept liability for any failure to deliver within that time.  You must pay by the designated payment method at the time of order. The price of any Product is the price in force at the date and time of your order. We may change the price of any Product before you place an order. We try to ensure that our prices displayed on our web site are accurate but the price on your order may need to be validated by us as part of the acceptance procedure. We will inform you if a Product’s correct price is higher than that stated in your order and you may cancel the order and decide whether or not to order the product at the correct price.  In addition to the price we will set out delivery costs and applicable taxes.  We are entitled to refuse any order placed by you. If your order is accepted, we or our provider will confirm acceptance to you by online electronic means (‘Confirmation’) to the email address you have given us on registration or on ordering. The order will then be fulfilled by the date set out in the Confirmation or, if the Confirmation does not contain such a date, within 30 days.  If the Product you ordered is unavailable, we may provide to you a substitute of an equivalent quality and price.  You may return any Products you have purchased within 30 days of delivery for any reason (including if you simply change your mind). To do so you must notify us in writing or other durable medium (including email) within those 30 days. You will then be entitled to a refund from us, which will be paid as soon as possible, but in any event within 30 days. You must arrange for and pay the costs of returning the Products tous or our provider.  While in your possession, you must keep any Products you intend to return to us in good condition.  Except as set out in this contract, all warranties, conditions, terms and undertakings, express or implied, whether by statute, common law, custom, trade usage, course of dealings or otherwise (including without limitation as to quality, performance or fitness or suitability for purpose) in respect of any Products are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.
17. SELF BILLING FOR UK VALUE ADDED TAX (VAT) REGISTERED USERS

If we implement self billing for UK VAT registered users the following terms and conditions will apply:
You must inform us whether you are registered for VAT and must inform us if at any time the position changes including any change in your VAT registered status, a change of your VAT number or if you sell all or part of your business.  Where you are UK VAT registered, you agree that we will self bill you.  We will issue self-billed invoices to you for all Taxable Supplies made to us by you (Taxable Supplies is defined by HM Customs & Excise as all goods and services which are VAT rated). The self-billed invoices will include your name, address and VAT number, together with all other details that constitute a full VAT invoice.  Our VAT number is 192435401 and we will agree new terms for self billing with you if our VAT number changes and we will inform you if the self-billed invoices are outsourced to a third party.  If it is subsequently found that you were not VAT registered or have failed to provide accurate and current information relating to your VAT status, then you shall immediately on demand by us repay to us any VAT paid over incorrectly (together with any associated interest and penalties incurred by us).  We may recover by debiting your account any money due to us in respect of tax and any associated interest or penalties.

No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of these Terms and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Photocrowd.com in any respect whatsoever.
