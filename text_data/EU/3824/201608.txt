The types of personal information collected in accordance with the activities listed above may vary depending on the activity. Personal information may include: Your name; User identification number; Email address; Home address; Phone number.

If you no longer wish to allow us to track or use this information, you may turn it off at the device level. Please note, the application may not work properly if we are unable to tell where you are coming from (country specific).
