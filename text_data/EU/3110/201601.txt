Use of Personal Data by PlanetRomeo
PlanetRomeo will process the Personal Data you provided to enable you to create an Account and Profile and to use our Service. PlanetRomeo may also use your email address to send you information and updates about your purchases.
PlanetRomeo aims to keep you informed of any changes to its Services, or similar products or services. PlanetRomeo will use your Personal Data to notify and/or email you regarding these changes, products or services. Please be aware that you will also receive emails and/or notifications from PlanetRomeo concerning the proper functioning of your Account.
PlanetRomeo allows you to interact and communicate with other Users. For instance, you can share content or your location. If you have unread messages on your Account and you have not read them within two weeks, PlanetRomeo may remind you about these messages. You can also 'opt-in' to receive an email notification every time a message is sent to you via the Service, by ticking the box for the Offline Notification available in your Account.
PlanetRomeo may use User Content that Users have chosen to make publicly visible and available only for internal marketing purposes on the Website or App (like highlighting new profiles on the Start-page or Top Footprints). The marketing is therefore limited to the Website and App and only pertains to PlanetRomeo itself. PlanetRomeo will never use non- public User Content for these limited marketing purposes. The User Content will not be used for marketing of third parties.
When you write to PlanetRomeo with an enquiry, request or question, you may choose to include some Personal Data. Such communications and any additional data supplied will be stored by PlanetRomeo. PlanetRomeo may use your email address to reply to you and your Personal Data may also be used to help us improve or respond more effectively to your customer service requests and support needs.
PlanetRomeo may request additional information from you to verify Personal Data or other information posted on your Account, on your Profile or that you have otherwise shared via the Service. Based on this information, PlanetRomeo may, at its sole discretion, decide to remove certain Personal Data or information and/or to suspend your use of the Service or terminate your Account.

Transmission of Personal Data to third parties
PlanetRomeo does not sell, trade or rent your Personal Data to third parties without your prior consent.
PlanetRomeo can provide your Personal Data to third parties, when this is essential for providing the Service and/or Additional Services to you or for carrying out your instructions.
If you choose to purchase Additional Services such as a PLUS subscription, you will be directed to a payment page of our payment provider Adyen. PlanetRomeo does not receive, process or store your name, address, credit or debit card data, or bank account information. In case you choose a recurring subscription, PlanetRomeo only stores the expiry date of your credit card.
The financial details you provide will be processed by Adyen as our processor on our behalf, only with the sole purpose of completing the financial transaction. These financial details will only be passed on to financial institutions who are involved with the chosen transaction (eg. your bank or credit-card company). Adyen will not pass on any financial details to other third parties, unless it is compelled to do so by law. For more information about Adyen, and its security, visit www.adyen.com.
PlanetRomeo may provide “aggregated anonymous data” about the usage of the Service to third parties for such purposes as it deems to be appropriate. “Aggregated anonymous data” is data that cannot be traced back to you and which therefore does not count as Personal Data. For instance, PlanetRomeo may use aggregated anonymous data to better understand how you and other Users use the Service.
In the event that PlanetRomeo (or any parts of it) are transferred to a third party, or that PlanetRomeo merges with a third party, or undergoes reorganization, your Personal Data may also be disclosed and/or transferred to that third party. This third party will have the right to continue to use Personal Data and other information that you provided to PlanetRomeo.
PlanetRomeo may disclose your Personal Data where it believes, in good faith, that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, criminal or civil subpoena, or other legal process or request by law enforcement authorities in the Netherlands, or to exercise its legal rights or defend itself against legal claims.
