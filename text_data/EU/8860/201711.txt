Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. By visiting www.ve.com you are accepting and consenting to the practices described in this policy. For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, we are the data controller.

We may collect and process the following data about you:

You may give us information about you by filling in forms on our site www.ve.com (our site) or by corresponding with us by phone, e-mail or otherwise, or by starting a shopping cart. This includes information you provide when you register to use our site, subscribe to our service, place an order on our site and when you report a problem with our site. The information you give us may include your name, address, e-mail address and phone number, financial and credit card information, and another other personal information that you choose to share with us.
Information we collect about you. Each time you visit our site, we may automatically collect the following information:

technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform;

We do not consider personal data to include information that is anonymous or that we have made anonymous so that it cannot be used to identify an individual. In line with every other internet business, we will analyse our server activity logs. These servers log the number of times different creative executions are served but no other data is stored. None of this recorded data is personally identifiable to any user. We do not collect any personally identifying information about the internet user for the purposes of internet advertising.

In this case we will have informed you when we collected that data that it may be shared internally and combined with data collected on this site. We are also working closely with third parties (including, for example, business partners, sub-contractors in technical, payment and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, search information providers, credit reference agencies) and may receive information about you from them.

Data collected by VePlatform. Ve has a suite of service offerings provided through one single platform. VePlatform is able to capture useful data available on a client website, information which can be used on behalf of the client to operate and optimize Ve’s experience of the service offerings.
Ve may use and exploit, in aggregated and/or anonymised form, any data resulting from or generated through the provision of any one of our services and service offerings including, for the avoidance of doubt, disclosing to its trusted partners. Such aggregated and anonymised data is not personal data.
Do we share your information?
We may share your personal information with any member of our group, which means our subsidiaries, our ultimate holding company and its subsidiaries, as defined in section 1159 of the UK Companies Act 2006.
We do not collect information about you from public bodies or private organisations. We may share anonymous information or information that we have made anonymous with our customers or other third parties to provide information for analytics, website usage or for other retail purposes.
We may disclose your personal information, if we are legally obliged to do so, to a third party buyer or seller in the event that we buy or sell any part of our business or assets. If Ve or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
We may disclose your personal information, if we are legally obliged to do so, to a third party buyer or seller in the event that we buy or sell any part of our business or assets. If Ve or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.
We may share your information with selected third parties including:

Business partners, suppliers and sub-contractors for the performance of any contract we enter into with them or you.
Advertisers and advertising networks that require the data to select and serve relevant adverts to you and others. We do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.
Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our site.

How do we store your information?
All data is stored in Microsoft Azure data centers in Europe, the US, Singapore, China and Russia. Microsoft Azure operates at the highest international standard as regards security, privacy and compliance. Microsoft Azure’s operations are overseen by a highly qualified internal team at Ve’s corporate head office. The team regularly monitors technical and operational performance against agreed parameters.
The data that we collect from you may be therefore transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data and take online security very seriously, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we receive your information, we use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. We use industry standard encryption technologies, including Secure Sockets Layer software (SSL), to protect the security of your personal data. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.
How long do we keep your information?
We do not keep personal data longer than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected. Personal data will not be kept longer than 30 days. Any data kept longer than 30 days will be kept only as anonymised statistics.
Unless the client requests their deletion, emails relating to a transaction where Ve has procured the conversion shall be kept for longer than 30 days for reconciliation purposes between the systems of Ve and the client.
Your rights
We want to keep you up to date with information about our products and services and to assist you with your inquiries. However, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us at privacy@ve.com.

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
Access to your information
The Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 to meet our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.
