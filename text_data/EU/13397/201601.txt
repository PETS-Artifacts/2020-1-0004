This Privacy Policy explains how Informatica Corporation and its subsidiary and affiliated companies worldwide (“Informatica”) collects, uses and shares your information.  This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted by Informatica and when you contact us for customer support.  Please note that a third party, Digital River, hosts the e-commerce platform on our Services.  As a result, any information you provide in connection with a purchase made via the Services will be collected by Digital River and governed by Digital River’s privacy policy.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our website homepages or sending you an email notification).  We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.
