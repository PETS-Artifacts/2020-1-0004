This Privacy Policy explains how Informatica LLC, Informatica Ireland EMEA UC and their respective subsidiaries (“Informatica”) collect, use and share your information. This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile applications and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us, including when you attend events hosted or attended by Informatica and when you contact us for customer support.  Please note that a third party, Digital River, hosts the e-commerce platform on our Services.  As a result, any information you provide in connection with a purchase made via the Services will be collected by Digital River and governed by Digital River’s separate privacy policy.  Additionally, this Informatica Privacy Policy does not apply to the information processed by Informatica on behalf of its customers via the Services.
We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.  If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our website homepages or sending you an email notification) or otherwise seek additional consent in accordance with applicable law.  We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you access the Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.

Information We Collect From Other Sources
We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services.  For example, if you connect an Informatica account with your social media account, we may have access to certain information from the company that owns or operates the social media account in accordance with the authorization procedures determined by such social media company.  Additionally, Informatica may receive information about you from other third parties whom you have authorized to share your information or who collect information in connection with co-branded offerings.

EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework
Informatica LLC and its US subsidiaries adhere in their processing of personal data received from the EU (“EU Data”) to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles established by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Commission (the “Principles”).  For more information about the Principles, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website. 
Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below.  If Informatica does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge for resolution to JAMS, Informatica’s designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider.  Under certain conditions specified by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.  Informatica is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the FTC.  If Informatica shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on Informatica’s behalf, then Informatica may be held liable for that third party’s processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless Informatica can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
