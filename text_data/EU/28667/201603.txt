Antiwar.com, like most \r\n                websites, records a small amount of information about the traffic \r\n                that it receives.\r\n              The information recorded consists of the date and time of a page \r\n                request, the page requested, the ip address of the requesting \r\n                device and the browser version and type used. By default this \r\n                is the only information that is automatically recorded about our \r\n                visitors.\r\n              Some of Antiwar.comâ€™s services ask that the visitor volunteer \r\n                additional information - in the case of a list signup this would \r\n                be an email address - in the case of a contribution this would \r\n                be basic information required by a credit card transaction.\r\n              General aggregated visitor information collected by Antiwar.com \r\n                is used by Antiwar.com to make day-to-day business decisions about \r\n                the site. Examples of this are determining what countries our \r\n                users visit the site from, what browsers we need to support, etc.\r\n              Voluntary promotion and opt-in service information may be used \r\n                for our own marketing purposes, or for the marketing purposes \r\n                of our partners. When this is the case it will be clearly stated. \r\n                Antiwar.com does not sell, loan or share any of this information \r\n                with any third party - unless otherwise explicitly stated in promotion \r\n                rules, terms of service agreements, etc.\r\n\t\t\t\tGoogle, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. \tGoogle\'s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet.\r\n\t\t\t\tUsers may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy.\r\n
