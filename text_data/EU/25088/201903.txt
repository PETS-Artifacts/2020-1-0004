2.1This section concerns DeskTime Clients that transfer Personal Data of end-users of the Service, such as personal data of Client’s employees, to DeskTime. In respect of such data, the Client sets the purpose and means of processing Personal Data, therefore the Client is the Data Controller.
2.2DeskTime processes end-users’ Personal Data on behalf of the Client, and DeskTime only accesses the data for the purpose of rendering the Service, therefore DeskTime is the Data Processor.
2.3If you as a Data Subject are the end-user of DeskTime Service and your profile was created by your employer, the privacy policy of the Client (e.g. your employer or other organization that created your account), on whose behalf we process the data, will apply. This means that any enquiry, request, objection or complaint that you as a Data Subject may have in connection with the processing of Personal Data that forms part of your DeskTime account should be addressed to and resolved by the Client as the Data Controller.
Details of processing
2.4When the Client creates accounts for end-users in its group the Client transfers the Personal Data of such end-users to DeskTime. In that way the Client instructs DeskTime to process Personal Data in order to provide Service to the Client pursuant to the agreement concluded between the Client and DeskTime.
2.5For the avoidance of doubt, this Privacy Policy contains complete and final instructions of the Client to DeskTime in relation to processing of Personal Data of end-users, and this Privacy Policy constitutes a binding data processing agreement.
2.6DeskTime will always process all Personal Data on behalf of the Client following the Client’s instructions and in compliance with the applicable data protection laws and regulations including requirements of GDPR where applicable.
Type of personal data and categories of data subjects
2.7Categories of data subjects whose Personal Data will be processed on behalf of the Client include the Client’s employees, representatives and other end-users that will be registered under the Client’s group account. The information about these individuals that may contain Personal Data are indicated in Paragraph 4.
2.8Client represents that it has acquired all necessary consents and/or relies on other appropriate legal basis for the processing of Personal Data of end-users. Client confirms that end-users have been informed about the fact that their Personal Data is transferred to DeskTime as a Processor and other third parties used by DeskTime for the provision of Service.
Duration of the processing
2.9DeskTime will process the aforementioned data for as long as DeskTime provides the Service to the Client and the Client has an active DeskTime account.
2.10When an end-user’s account is deleted by the Client, DeskTime will process data of deleted accounts in the Client’s group for statistical and analytical interests of the Client. However, such data can be deleted at any time upon Client’s request.
2.11After terminating contractual relationship between DeskTime and the Client, we may continue to store some Personal Data, but limited to the minimum amount required, as might be necessary for us to comply with legal obligations, to ensure reliable back-up systems, to resolve disputes between the Client and DeskTime, if any, to prevent fraud and abuse, to enforce DeskTime agreements, and/or to pursue legitimate interests of DeskTime or third parties.
Sub-processors
2.12The Client consents that DeskTime, for the purpose of providing Service to the Clients, uses sub-processors that provide DeskTime the services indicated in Paragraph 7. DeskTime ensures that it only uses sub-processors that comply with the same data protection obligations as set out in this Privacy Policy, in particular provides sufficient guarantees and has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures and otherwise comply with the requirements of GDPR where applicable. If such sub-processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations, DeskTime shall remain liable to the Client.
Assistance to the controller
2.13Taking into account the nature of the processing, DeskTime as a Data Processor will assist the Client with provision of technical or organizational measures, insofar as possible, for the fulfilment of the Client’s obligations as a Data Controller in relation to:

Any requests from the Client’s end-users in respect of access to or the rectification, erasure, restriction, portability, blocking or deletion of their Personal Data that DeskTime processes on behalf of the Client. In the event that a Data Subject sends such a request directly to DeskTime, DeskTime will promptly forward such request to the Client; and
The investigation of Personal Data breaches and the notification to the Supervisory Authority and Client's end-users regarding such Personal Data breaches; and
Where appropriate, the preparation of data protection impact assessments and, where necessary, carrying out consultations with any Supervisory Authority.

Return and deletion of data
2.14Unless otherwise required by applicable law, DeskTime has no obligation to store the Client’s data after termination of the agreement with the Client and deletion of the Client’s account and all accounts associated with it.
2.15At the choice of the Client, DeskTime will delete or return all the Personal Data to the Client after the end of the provision of Service relating to processing and shall delete existing copies, unless applicable law requires DeskTime to store such Personal Data.
