              COOKIES AND OTHER WEB TECHNOLOGIES AND FURTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED
            

Our Services use cookies, "beacons" and other web technologies (collectively, "Web Technologies").  When you visit or interact with our Services we may use Web Technologies to collect information about your usage and device including, without limitation, location based data, device identifier numbers, browsing history, domain name, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, date and time of each visit, the pages you visit, and other information.  
We may use this information to improve and personalise your experience while using our Services, or while visiting our stores, based on areas we believe may be of interest to you.  For example, when you are using our App, we may use location information and unique device identifiers so that we may offer you tailored information about our products while you are physically present in our stores.  Information collected from you, including via Web Technologies, may also be used to facilitate, support and improve the technical performance and functioning of the Services.
If you use our Services, you are consenting to the use of Web Technologies (including cookies) in accordance with our Cookie Policy.

In addition, we may offer you additional choices with respect to the use of these Web Technologies.  Some of our Web Technologies will only be employed on your device on an opt-in basis, i.e. where you actively choose to receive them.  For example, when using the App in a store where the service has been rolled out, you will be prompted to confirm whether you agree to your location data being used so we can make you aware of any special in-store items or promotions.  You can withdraw consent at any time by turning off the location services sharing settings for the App on your Device, or by deleting the App.

Please note that if you decide to opt out it may take a few days to process your opt-out request and that you may continue to receive promotional or marketing materials during this time.

             WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA
            

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.



              INFORMATION SECURITY
            

We use commercially reasonable methods to prevent the unauthorised use, access, or disclosure of your personal information. For example, all information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology and card data you save within your account for future purchases is stored securely within level 1 PCI compliant data centres. 
While we strive to protect your personal information, no system can ever be 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information; any transmission is at your own risk. You can help protect your online personal data by following these safety tips:
If using a public computer or terminal, always log out and close the browser when you complete an online session.
Keep passwords private. Remember, anybody who knows your password may access your account.
When creating a password, a combination of letters and numbers is best.  Do not use dictionary words, your name, email address, or other personal information that can be easily obtained. It is also recommended that you frequently change your password.
Avoid using the same password for multiple online accounts.
You should use your own virus protection software and keep it up to date.
If there has been (or you suspect) an unauthorised use of your password or account, please notify us immediately.
Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our Sites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.



              CHILDREN
            

Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  If you are under the age of 13, please stop using our Services.  It is our policy not to knowingly solicit or permit children under the age of 13 to provide their personal information for any purpose.

             CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS
            

California law permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, information about the personally identifiable information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. At this time, AllSaints does not share personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.
In addition, under California law, website operators are required to disclose how they respond to web browser "do not track" signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information of a consumer over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection.  At this time, we do not track our customers' personal information over time and across third-party websites.  This law also requires website operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personally identifiable information about their users' online activities over time and across different Sites when the users use the operator's website.  AllSaints does not knowingly permit third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses our Services.



             THIRD PARTY SITES
            

Our Services may contain links to other sites, such as social networking platforms.  Please be aware that we do not endorse and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. The Privacy Policy presented here does not apply to such sites.  If you have any questions about these other companies' data practices, you should review their privacy policies.
