This information is used for statistical and marketing purposes but is not personal in nature and does not impinge on your rights under GDPR.\r\n\r\nWhat is the legal basis for processing the data and how will it be used?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour data will be processed for the purpose of assessing applications to the HEI.
