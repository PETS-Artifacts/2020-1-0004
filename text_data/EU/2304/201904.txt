Privacy policy


Team Qwant

Qwant ensures that your privacy is protected, and this is the cornerstone of our philosophy. We don‚Äôt use any cookie nor any tracking device that may allow us to track your browsing habits or to establish your profile. You are of course entitled to the rights provided by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (‚ÄúGDPR‚Äù), but we also forbid ourselves from collecting an important amount of data that others collect, which are useless to provide you with the services you need. We never try to find out who you are or what you are personally doing when you use our search engine. When we do need to collect data, we do not disclose nor sell it for commercial or other uses. We use it exclusively to provide you with the services offered by Qwant.
This Privacy Policy is aimed at explaining in further details our ethical approach towards personal data, and at explaining the few cases where we have to collect information about you, the reasons why we collect such data, and the way we might use it. It also presents the security measures that we apply to protect their confidentiality, and reminds your rights and how to exercize them.
How does Qwant protect your privacy?
We should always ask our search engine what are the personal data that it does not collect üôÇ
As a principle, Qwant does not collect data about its users when they search. Plain and simple.
When you use Qwant as a search engine, we don‚Äôt put any cookie on your browser that may allow us or others to recognize you or to follow you everywhere on the Internet. We don‚Äôt use any tracking device (pixel, fingerprinting‚Ä¶). We don‚Äôt collect and we don‚Äôt store any history or your searches. When you search, your query is instantly anonymized by being dissociated from your IP address, in accordance with what the French data controller advices. Long story short, what you are doing with Qwant is part of your privacy and we don‚Äôt want to know.
Qwant has a Privacy office dedicated to protecting your privacy. It also has a Data Protection Officer (DPO). Both work closely with eachother to ensure that the relevant regulation regarding personal data is applied as strongly as it should.
The DPO keeps an updated register of all processing of personal data made by Qwant for his services. For instance, when you create an account on the site, you can choose to fill in your profile and this is a processing of personal data for which the register will say how data may be kept (and how long), and who can access it.
We commit to do anything we can to ensure the security and confidentiality of our users personal data, including by preventing data damage, loss, or access by unauthorized third parties. Qwant‚Äôs URL has the HTTPS header that shows users they communicate with Qwant through a secure channel using the TLS protocol. Technically, TLS ensures users that their data can‚Äôt be intercepted by fraud. Moreover, the green lock that you see on most browsers when using Qwant certifies that you are browsing a secure website.
When do we collect personal data, and why?
Qwant does not require any registration to use its search engine. However, you may want to register an account to sign-in and enjoy advanced functionalities such as the possibility to save search results in favorites, or create Boards.
In such cases, we collect some personal data such as your name, firstname and email address:

when you register to our services. You are free to manage yourself all the information related to your account (information changes, corrections, updates and deletion);
or when you use forms available on our website, so that Qwant can process your request.

Qwant also collects connection data, not associated with your search queries, only to ensure the security of its information system and, if you create or modify Boards, to respect the obligation to identify content creators mandated by law.
Even when you are connected with an ID, we don‚Äôt use any cookie nor any other tracking device when you browse the site. The only technology that may be installed on your browser, called ‚Äúlocal storage‚Äù, is used to locally save your settings (language, activation or deactivation of options‚Ä¶). You can delete personal data stored in your ‚Äúlocal storage‚Äù by deactivating cookies in your browser. However, this deactivation may prevent you from accessing some functionalities of the site, such as your browsing preferences.

the technical management of the user‚Äôs account(s) and available services, in accordance with our Terms of Use ;
the management of information requests, in the context of the use of the services;
the management of job applications, in the context of Qwant‚Äôs recruitement processes;
the management of delisting requests, requests related to rights regarding personal data, and content removal requests, in the context of the compliance by Qwant of its legal obligations;

How about ads? Aren‚Äôt they tracked?
Qwant is a free search engine open to anyone. Our main source of revenues comes from ads displayed on Qwant results page.
But we take pride of doing it while respecting both your privacy and your search experience of Qwant.
Qwant does not track people, and this is never going to change.
We believe you will possibly find commercials interesting when they are directly related to what you are searching.
Through their numerous formats, ads have too often taken over the use experience. On Qwant, you will never see intrusive ads that get in the way of what are looking for.
With such commitments, we hope to demonstrate that such responsible and respectful behavior is possible. We have been working for several month at identifying and designing solutions aligned with those principles. We believe we now have designed a simple and efficient offering by working with the Microsoft Bing ad network.
Therefore, every ad that Qwant displays fully adheres to the values we defend and our quality standards.
When you use Qwant, no personal information whatsoever is neither captured or transmitted to advertisers.
In details:
‚Äì No third party cookies
‚Äì No trackers
‚Äì No behavioral targeting
‚Äì No campaigns mixing legit and promotional content (native advertising)
We believe advertising can be a responsible business model.
How does Qwant index the web?
We continue our efforts to index all the Web diversity. Our crawlers relentlessly visit the global Web to refine our results. Nevertheless, this requires both a lot of resources and time: some parts of the Web are not yet perfectly indexed. In the meantime, our agreement with Microsoft Bing allows us to complement our own results with those of Microsoft Bing to offer the best possible results from all around the Web.
