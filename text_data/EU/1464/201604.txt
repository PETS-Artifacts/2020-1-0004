Privacy Policy
Updated: March 2, 2016

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Quizlet we have a few fundamental principles:

We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what's visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.

It is Quizlet's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website and the two Quizlet mobile applications.
This privacy statement describes how Quizlet Inc. ("Quizlet") collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website, quizlet.com, and the two official Quizlet iOS and Android mobile applications. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.

Website Visitors
Like most website operators, Quizlet collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Quizlet's purpose in collecting non-personally-identifying information is to understand better how Quizlet's visitors use its website. From time to time, Quizlet may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
Quizlet also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Quizlet does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
Certain visitors to Quizlet's website choose to interact with Quizlet in ways that require Quizlet to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Quizlet gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Quizlet to provide a username, date of birth, and email address. Those who engage in financial transactions with Quizlet are asked to provide additional information, such as name and credit card number. In each case, Quizlet collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Quizlet. Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").
Geo-Location Data
We do not ask you for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our mobile apps or services.
Children
For children under 13, Quizlet offers a limited feature set and website experience. We require consent from a parent when children under the age of 13 want to register on Quizlet, and offer a limited version of the website that removes certain social features. The only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is a parent's email address.
Safety on Quizlet
Children's safety and full enjoyment of Quizlet, as well as the safety and well being of all children and their families, is of the utmost importance to all of us at Quizlet. Quizlet does not accumulate personal information about any child or family for distribution, sharing, or selling, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We only keep an email on file for notifying parents of their child's wish to join Quizlet.
Aggregated Statistics
Quizlet may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website and mobile applications. For instance, Quizlet may monitor the most popular word sets on the Quizlet site. Quizlet may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Quizlet does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
How We Handle Personally-Identifying Information
Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Quizlet's behalf or to provide services available on Quizlet's website and mobile applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Quizlet's website and mobile applications, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Quizlet will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Quizlet discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or when Quizlet believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Quizlet or third parties, the public at large or if Quizlet is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information. If you are a registered user of a Quizlet website or mobile application and have supplied your email address, Quizlet may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Quizlet and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Quizlet takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. You may choose to stop receiving our email by updating your email settings within your profile or you can contact us at quizlet.com/feedback.

Parental Rights
Parents and legal guardians of children under 13 who are members of Quizlet have certain rights under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and Quizlet recognizes those rights. Parents/guardians can consent to collection and use of a child's personally-identifying information without consenting to the disclosure of information to third parties. Currently, the only identifiable information we collect from children under 13 is a parent's email address.
Parents/guardians can review information their children under 13 have contributed to Quizlet by accessing their child's account via password reset. Parents can also request that Quizlet delete that information and refuse to allow Quizlet to collect further information from their children by contacting our Support department at quizlet.com/feedback. Quizlet may ask additional questions or take other steps to verify the identity of parents/guardians before responding to a request to review or delete their child's information, or a request to refuse further collection from children.
A child's participation or access to an activity on Quizlet cannot be conditioned on him or her providing more information than is reasonably necessary for that activity, or any personally-identifying information. Quizlet does not collect personally-identifying information from children under 13, without a parent or guardian's consent.

To request removal of your personal information from these areas, contact us at quizlet.com/feedback.

Tracking Technologies
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Quizlet and our partners affiliates, or analytics or service providers, as described above. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We may combine this automatically-collected log information with other information we collect about you for analytics and support to improve the performance of the services we offer you.

Social Media Widgets
Our website includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook "Like" button, and widgets, such as the "Share This" button. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly.
