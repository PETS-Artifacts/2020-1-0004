India Payments Terms of Service
Last modified: February 5, 2018
WhatsApp Inc. ("WhatsApp," "our," "we," or "us") provides messaging, Internet calling, and other services to users around the world, including the ability to send and receive payments through designated payment service providers ("PSPs") in India ("Payments"). Payments is a "Service" as defined in the WhatsApp Terms of Service ("Terms"), and the following WhatsApp Payments Terms of Service ("Payments Terms") supplement the Terms and apply to your use of Payments. You agree to the Payments Terms when you use Payments.
About our payment service
Our Role. Payments is a service we provide through, and in coordination with, designated PSPs. We provide a convenient platform that enables you to submit transaction instructions to PSPs for processing via the Unified Payments Interface ("UPI"). We are not a licensed financial institution, do not receive, transfer, or store any funds in connection with Payments, and are not responsible for UPI service interruptions or acts or omissions of PSPs or your bank including the payment, settlement, and clearance of funds. You have a separate relationship with your bank regarding your bank account, and WhatsApp has no affiliation with your bank in this respect.
PSP's Role. When you initiate a transaction through Payments, a designated PSP receives the instructions and processes the transaction via UPI. By using Payments, you will also need to agree to the PSP's terms and privacy policy, which will be presented to you when you first use Payments. The PSP's terms and privacy policy are also available here. These Payments Terms govern the relationship between WhatsApp and you regarding Payments, and the PSP's terms govern the relationship between the PSP and you.
Eligibility. To use Payments, you must use a phone number with the country code for India and have a bank account with a bank that supports UPI. The phone number you use for our Services must be the same phone number linked to your bank account used for Payments.
Registration. You must be an owner of the bank account you use to send and receive funds through Payments. After you provide information to confirm your mobile banking account, WhatsApp creates a virtual payment address that is associated with your WhatsApp account. We will ask you to create an UPI PIN for your bank account if you do not already have one.
Age. You must be at least 18 years old to use Payments.
Fees and Taxes. You must pay any applicable fees arising out of your use of Payments, including any overdraft, transaction, or other fees charged by your bank, PSPs, or WhatsApp. You must comply with applicable tax laws in connection with your use of Payments, including reporting and payment of any taxes related to transactions made through Payments and any income received from such transactions. WhatsApp is not responsible for withholding, collecting, reporting, or remitting any sales, use, value added, or other tax arising from any transaction you complete using Payments.
Privacy policy and user data
WhatsApp cares about your privacy. Our Privacy Policy applies to your use of Payments. Because additional information will be collected and processed when you use Payments, the WhatsAppÂ Payments Privacy Policy also applies to your use of Payments. The WhatsApp Payments Privacy Policy describes additional information practices applicable to Payments, including the types of information we receive and collect from you when you use Payments and how we use and share this information. If you use Payments, you agree to our data practices, including the collection, use, processing, and sharing of your information as described in our Privacy Policy and our Payments Privacy Policy, as well as the transfer and processing of your information to the United States and other countries globally where we have or use facilities, service providers, or partners, regardless of where you use Payments. You acknowledge that the laws, regulations, and standards of the country in which your information is stored or processed may be different from those of your own country.
Use of payments
Payment Amount. You are responsible for the total payment amount. You must ensure that you have sufficient funds in your bank account before executing any transaction through Payments.
Acceptable Use of Payments. You must access and use Payments only for legal, authorized, and acceptable purposes, according to our Terms and posted policies. A PSP or WhatsApp may impose limits on your ability to send or receive payments, including transaction limits. A PSP or WhatsApp may also cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates the Terms, these Payments Terms, posted policies, or the PSP's terms.
Purchase Transactions. If you use Payments to pay for goods or services, you agree to make legitimate purchases and to be bound by any terms of the sale. We have no responsibility for any goods or services purchased using Payments, including for any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, chargebacks or disputes associated with transactions. WE MAKE NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES SOLD USING PAYMENTS.
Payments Transactions Are Final. Once you submit a payment, it is final. WhatsApp does not provide refunds or facilitate chargebacks. WhatsApp is not liable for unauthorized transactions. We assume no responsibility for the underlying transaction of funds, or the actions or identity of any transfer recipient or sender.
Business Use of Payments. If you are a business and use our Services, you must comply with all applicable laws associated with your use of our Services, including Payments. You must clearly disclose any applicable terms and fees to your customers and promptly fulfill any goods or services you sell using Payments in accordance with any sale terms and applicable laws. WhatsApp is not a party to the transaction.
Other

If there is any conflict between these Payments Terms and the Terms, these Payments Terms control solely with respect to your use of Payments and only to the extent of the conflict.
We may amend or update these Payments Terms. We will provide you notice of amendments to our Payments Terms, as appropriate, and update the "Last Modified" date at the top of our Payments Terms. Your continued use of Payments confirms your acceptance of our Payments Terms, as amended. If you do not agree to our Payments Terms, as amended, you must stop using Payments. Please review our Payments Terms from time to time.

While ICICI Bank shall endeavour to promptly execute and process the transactions as proposed to be made by the User, ICICI Bank shall not be responsible for any non-response or delay in responding due to any reason whatsoever, including due to failure of operational systems or any requirement of law. ICICI Bank shall not be liable for any loss, claim or damage suffered by the User and/or any other third party arising out of or resulting from failure of a UPI transaction on account of time-out transaction; i.e., where no response is received from NPCI or the beneficiary bank to the transaction request and/or where mobile number or account number of the beneficiary does not exist.

ICICI Bank shall refuse to comply with the Payment Orders without assigning any reason and shall not be under any duty to assess the prudence or otherwise of any Payment Order. ICICI Bank has the right to suspend the transactions with respect to the UPI Facility if it has reason to believe that the User's Payment Orders will lead to or expose to direct or indirect loss to ICICI Bank or may require an indemnity from the User before continuing to operate the UPI Facility.

Any such sale, assignment, securitisation or transfer shall conclusively bind the User and all other persons. The User, their successors and assigns are bound by these Terms. However, the User shall not be entitled to transfer or assign any of their rights and obligations under these Terms.
