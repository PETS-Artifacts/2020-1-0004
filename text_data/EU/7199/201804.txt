The updated notice reflects the results of our recent review.

You also may not receive advertising or other offers from us that may be relevant to your individual interests and needs.




Show Do you use Flash objects?

Yes, Flash objects are used as part of our solutions for online authentication to help us recognize you and your device when you come back to our site.

Show What is relationship based advertising?

Relationship-based advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. These advertisements and offers are based on the type of relationship you have with us, for example: If you’re a checking customer, we might present you with a special offer for reordering checks.




Show What is online behavioral advertising?

Online behavioral advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful. Here’s how it works: We gather information about your online activities, such as the searches you conduct on our sites and the pages you visit. This information may be used to deliver advertising on our sites as well as offline that’s customized to meet specific interests you may have.




Show Why does Bank of America use Online Behavioral Advertising?

Online behavioral advertising helps us provide you with information about products and services you might find interesting and useful.




Show Can I opt out of online behavioral advertising?

Yes. If you prefer that we not use information about your online site activities to deliver advertising on our sites and offline (for example, by phone, email and direct mail), you can opt out of online behavioral advertising. If you opt out, though, you may still receive generic advertising. In addition, financial advisors/Client Managers may continue to use information collected online to provide product and service information in accordance with account agreements.
Also, if you opt out of online behavioral advertising, you may still see ads when you sign in to your account, for example through Online Banking or MyMerrill. These ads are based on your specific account relationships with us. Remember that your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for opt-outs to work.




Show Can I opt out of Online Behavioral Advertising on other sites?

On third-party sites where we advertise, Bank of America uses the Advertising Options Icon on our behavioral ads (excluding ads appearing on platforms that do not accept the icon). Anyone receiving a behavioral ad may click on the displayed icon to receive more information and can opt out at that time or by visiting the third-party site's privacy policy for an opt out mechanism.
You may also opt out of receiving behavioral ads from many sites through the Network Advertising Initiative's Opt Out Tool or other tools provided by the publishing platform.
Please note that if you opt out, you may still receive untailored online advertising from Bank of America. Opting out from a specific third-party site means that the ads you receive will not be tailored based on your choices or behavior.  Remember that your browser must be set to accept cookies in order for opt outs to work, and if you clear your cookies you will need to opt out again.
