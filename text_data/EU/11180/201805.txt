Privacy Policy

  I wont go into some long paragraph telling you something you wont read, but 
  here are the basics:
IP ADDRESS
  Your IP is logged every time you view the site. This helps log how many users 
  on on the site the same time as you. (I.E. Who's Online) Your IP ADDRESS will 
  never be given out unless required by law. But that is highly doubtful.
COOKIES
  Cookies are used to keep ads from popping up every 10 seconds.
EXTERNAL LINKS
  Entensity links to a lot of other sites. (I.E. FFL) Therefore can not be held 
  responsible for any type of spyware, viruses, or damage they cause. HOWEVER, 
  it's your right to report such sites so they can be looked into or removed. 
  You shouldn't receive any type of virus/spyware from Entensity.net. If you do 
  please let shane know!
If you have any questions about this don't be afraid to ask.
