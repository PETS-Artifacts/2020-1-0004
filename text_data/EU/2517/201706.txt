OTHER INFORMATION
 
Collection of Other Information
“Other Information” is any information that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but does not reveal your specific identity or directly identify an individual, such as: browser and device information; time spent on the Services, pages visited, date and time an ad was served, clicks on ads, and other anonymous traffic data; your precise location; unique identifier, including mobile device identifier; demographic information; information provided by you; and aggregated information.
We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including through: your browser or device; your mobile device identifier; your use of our applications; the use of pixel tags and other similar technologies; your IP address; the aggregation of information; and cookies (cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using). Each browser has its own set of cookies, and uses them for record-keeping. We use cookies on our triplelift.com website and as part of the Services, but these do not get intermingled with anything else. Anything that may be personally identifiable to you from this website (i.e., if you submit an inquiry and provide your name and email) will not be tied back to you from an advertising perspective.
Our media property clients may also collect information about you that they choose to pass to us either directly through our Services. The information such clients may share includes network type of a user’s device, year of birth, ethnicity (where permitted by law), gender, and precise geolocation (where permitted by law). Some clients may provide precise geolocation information collected on certain platforms.

to provide you with personalized location-based services and content through the use of your device’s physical location (where permitted by law),
to track your use of the Services to improve the design and functionality of the Services,
to supplement Other Information with additional information we receive from third parties such as advertising segments to allow us to target ads to you that may be of interest to you,
to measure and report on the success of marketing campaigns,
to diagnose server problems and administer the Services via your IP Address (a number automatically assigned to the computer or device that you are using by your Internet Service Provider),
as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of you or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.
