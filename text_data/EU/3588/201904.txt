\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy\r\n\r\nValid from: 01.10.2018\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Introduction\r\n\r\nFor\r\nPONS GmbH (referred to below as the "publishing company" or the "company")\r\nthe protection of our customers\x92 personal data is a matter of the greatest\r\nimportance. We are committed to ensuring that you can rely on the protection of\r\nyour personal data by our company at all times, and know how our company both\r\nuses your data and ensures its protection.\r\n\r\nThis\r\nprivacy policy informs you about the processing of personal data (referred to\r\nbelow as the "data") by our company when you make use of the services\r\noffered by our website.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2.\r\nResponsible party\r\n\r\nPONS\r\nGmbH\r\n\r\nSt\xf6ckachstr.\r\n11\r\n\r\n70190\r\nStuttgart\r\n\r\nTel.:\r\n0711 / 89462111\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEmail:\r\nkundenservice@pons.de\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3.\r\nContact data of our Data Protection Officer\r\n\r\nMichael\r\nMayer, datenschutz@pons.de \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.\r\nProcessing of personal data \r\n\r\nYour\r\ndata is processed and used in compliance with the applicable statutory\r\nregulations, in particular the EU\'s General Data Protection Regulation (referred\r\nto below as the "GDPR"). \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.1\r\nWebshop orders\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhy\r\nand on what legal basis is data processed?\r\n\r\nWhen\r\nyou place an order with our online shop, the data required for the\r\nestablishment of a purchase contract and the processing of the order is\r\nrecorded. The data includes your full name, email address, invoice address and,\r\nif necessary, the delivery address. The data is processed for the purpose of\r\nassigning the order to you as well as for the delivery of the goods and, if\r\nnecessary, sending you an invoice, together with the processing of payment and\r\nclarification of possible legal claims. If you order media on concessionary\r\nterms, we also process your data in order to check if the preconditions for\r\nthis are met. \r\n\r\nThe legal\r\nbasis for this is Art. 6 Section 1 b) GDPR. If you wish you can create a\r\ncustomer account for future orders (registration). In this case your customer data is\r\nsaved so that it can also be used for future orders placed with our online shop,\r\nwithout having to enter it once more. When you register an account you also\r\nneed to set a password (access data), so that access to this account is only\r\navailable to you. In accordance with Art. 6 Section 1 b) GDPR, we have the\r\nright to process the data you provide on registration, to the extent that this\r\nis necessary for the establishment or fulfilment of a contract. In addition we may\r\nprocess your data in accordance with Art. 6 Section 1 f) GDPR for the purpose\r\nof simplifying your future orders.\r\n\r\nIf\r\nyou have provided your consent by activating the relevant checkbox we are also\r\npermitted, in accordance with Art. 6 Section 1 a) and if relevant 1 f) GDPR, to\r\nprocess any data which you have voluntarily provided us with when placing an\r\norder or registering an account. Such data may refer to your company/school and\r\nsimilar details. The processing of these voluntarily provided details is\r\nimplemented so that we can get in touch with you faster in the event of\r\ndelivery problems. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 Section 1 a) and if\r\nrelevant 1 f) GDPR. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs\r\ndata passed on to other parties?\r\n\r\nWe\r\npass on data, at least in part, to the following external processors and other\r\nrecipients for the purposes described below:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n  Collection agencies\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  Data is only passed on for\r\n  the collection of debts from customers who fail to pay the purchase price of\r\n  goods.\r\n  \r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n  for further recipients see\r\n  4.5.1 below\r\n  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn relation to orders placed with our\r\nwebshop we are jointly responsible for the processing of your data together\r\nwith Stuttgarter Verlagskontor GmbH, Roteb\xfchlstr. 77, 70178 Stuttgart (referred\r\nto below as "SVK"). SVK accepts the order, enters the relevant data\r\ninto the database, sends off the goods, issues the invoice and collects the\r\ninvoice amount in its own name and for its own account ("non-recourse factoring").\r\nWe therefore pass on your order data to SVK for this purpose. \r\n\r\nThe legal basis for the transfer of data\r\nto SVK is Art. 6 Section 1 f GDPR. The publishing company and SVK are\r\naffiliates within the Klett Bildungsgruppe corporation. We therefore\r\nhave a legitimate interest in transferring data to SVK for internal\r\nadministrative purposes, because this is the only way that SVK can collect the\r\nprice of their purchases from our customers. \r\n\r\nThe publishing company and SVK have\r\nconcluded an agreement covering their respective responsibilities under data\r\nprotection regulations, and the main elements of this agreement can be made\r\navailable to you by email on request. \r\n\r\nOrders from Switzerland and Austria are\r\npassed on to our partners in these countries:\r\n\r\nSwitzerland: Balmer B\xfccherdienst AG, Kobiboden, CH-8840\r\nEinsiedeln. \r\n\r\nAustria: Medienlogistik Pichler - \xd6BZ GmbH&Co. KG, PO Box 133, A-2355 Wiener\r\nNeudorf.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDo I have to enter my data?\r\n\r\nThere\r\nis no legal or contractual requirement for you to provide your data. However,\r\nfor the purpose of establishing a purchase contract with us your name, address\r\nand email address are required as a minimum. Otherwise we will not be able to\r\nsend the order to your address, or provide you with confirmation of your order\r\nby email. With all forms of payment except for purchases made on account the\r\nentry of payment data is necessary, because otherwise we will not be able to\r\ndebit your account or credit card with the agreed price. In order to conclude a\r\ncontract with us, no further details or registration are necessary. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nWhen will my data be deleted at the\r\nlatest?\r\n\r\nWe\r\nhave the right to save data until the final fulfilment of the individual\r\ncontract. In the case of purchase contracts, we can save data until the receipt\r\nof payment and for a period of up to 2 years after the goods have been\r\ndelivered. If the saving of data is necessary for the purpose of compliance\r\nwith our legal obligations in accordance with Art. 6 Section 1 c) GDPR, in conjunction\r\nwith Germany\'s Commercial Code or tax regulations, we have the right to save such\r\ndata until the expiry of the retention periods which the applicable laws and\r\nregulations stipulate. This can lead to a retention period of up to 7 years. Unless\r\nwe have the right or obligation to retain the data for a longer period of time\r\nfor the reasons which are outlined above, the data you enter when you register\r\nan account with us will either be deleted as soon as possible at your request, or\r\nat the latest four years after you place your last order.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.2\r\nAdvertising\r\n\r\nIn\r\nrare cases we also use your data to send you advertising by post or email for\r\nour products, provided that you have been a customer for three years, have\r\nprovided us with your postal or email address, and have not refused your\r\nconsent to such advertising (with regard to your right of refusal, please\r\nsee 5.4). The processing of your data is implemented on the basis of Art. 6\r\nSection 1 f) GDPR. We have a legitimate business interest in sending\r\nadvertising by post or email to our customer base. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4.3\r\nMaking contact\r\n\r\nAny\r\ndata you enter on our contact form or communicate to us by email or otherwise\r\nwill be processed so that we can deal with and reply to your enquiry. If desired,\r\nit will also be processed for the purpose of sending a copy of your enquiry to\r\nyour own email address. \r\n\r\nIn\r\naccordance with Art. 6 Section 1 a) GDPR, we can process the\r\ndata you have entered on our contact form, provided that you have given your consent\r\nto this by clicking on the "Send message" button. If you enter\r\nsensitive information in the "Message" field which contains specific\r\ncategories of data (e.g. your origins, political opinions, religion, medical\r\ndata), you also give your consent to the processing of such data. If you send\r\nus the data by email or in some other form, the legal basis will be Art. 6\r\nSection 1 f) and if relevant 1 b) GDPR.\r\n\r\nThe\r\ndata concerned will be deleted at the latest 24 months after the receipt of\r\nyour enquiry, unless we are entitled or obliged to save it for a longer period\r\non the basis of legal requirements in conjunction with Art. 6 Section 1\r\nc) GDPR. This may lead to a maximum retention period of seven years.\r\n\r\nWe\r\nprovide your contact enquiry to the external processors stated under 4.1 and\r\n4.6.1, and if appropriate also to the following recipients: \r\n\r\nProspero\r\nGmbH\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 M\xfcllerstrasse 27, 80469 Munich\r\n\r\nTelemarkt\r\nGmbH & Co.
