Social Sharing Settings

Within our Services there are four sharing settings:  Private, Share with Friends, MyFitnessPal Members Only (only available within MyFitnessPal), and Public.  Under Armour apps are designed for your wellness and fitness benefit. As such, you are able to control what Personal Data you share and with whom you share it. We encourage you to adjust the sharing settings to best meet your objectives and sharing comfort level. In the interest of safeguarding your Personal Data, we have outlined some initial default sharing settings.

 Default Sharing Settings 

 "Physical Stats" are set as Private.  "Private" means not shared with friends or other members.  You can change this default status for some of your physical stats. Information that is "Private" by default includes, for example, your height, weight, BMI, and heart rate. 
 "Activity Stats" are set as Share with Friends.  "Share with Friends" means visible to your friends, but not shared with other members. You can change this default status if you want.  Information that is set as "Share with Friends" by default includes, for example, your workouts, steps, routes, friends challenges, and friendships.
  Community Social Data is set as Public.  "Public" means visible to all others using the service.  For example social posts where you have set your account up as "Follow" (in app and on the websites), community forums, public challenges (challenges set up by Under Armour), and photos. 
  Lookup Information is set as Public.  We believe that social motivation helps you achieve your goals faster and allowing your friends to be able to find you is crucial to this experience. Therefore, your first and last name, location, gender, username, main fitness activity, and profile picture are set as Public.  If you set your entire account as Private, your lookup data will no longer be available for your friends to find you (unless you otherwise indicate that desire within the Services).

 Changing Your Sharing Preferences 
 Details on how to update your sharing preferences and the default settings for our Services are outlined within the sharing standard.
   Note:  When you share information from our Services externally with a SNS, the information you post is governed by their privacy policy and settings.


Interest-Based Advertising

Interest-based advertising is advertising that is targeted to you based on your web browsing and app usage over time and across websites or apps.  Our advertising practices also include the creation and use of "audience segments." You have the option to restrict the use of information for interest-based advertising and to opt-out of receiving interest-based ads.  Depending on where you access our website from, you may also be asked to consent to our use of cookies, including advertising cookies. Additional information on Audience Segments and our choices for interest- based advertising is found below.

 Audience Segments
  
Read More


    We disclose various types of information for purposes of interest-based advertising, including for third party, interest-based advertising. This processing includes the use of Personal Data to create de-identified audience segments. These audience segments are then made available for interest-based advertising, including for third party advertising, on Under Armour online properties. The audience segments are based on website visits, app usage data, Fitness and Wellness Data, online and offline purchasing behaviours, interaction with our ads or marketing emails, similar types of information, and in some cases, data from third parties. The segments, prior to being used, are de-identified so that they will not identify you personally.
   

United States Note:  The audience segments are made available for interest-based advertising for third party advertising on Under Armour online properties and on and within third party websites and apps. We use one or more safe haven entities and partners to de-identify segments before sharing these segments for third party advertising displayed on online properties operated by entities other than Under Armour.  We use a third party to match de-identified segments to targeting IDs that are then used on third party sites.




 Interest-Based Advertising Opt Outs, Choices, and Control
  
Read More

For all of the interest-based advertising described above, including segments, you have the choice to not have your data used to target and serve you interest-based advertising-including third party advertising-regardless of where such ads might be served.  These opt-outs require that strictly necessary cookies are not blocked by the settings in your web browser.  We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the US, the Canadian Digital Advertising Alliance in Canada, and the European Digital Advertising Alliance in the EU. If you live in the United States, Canada, or the European Union, you can visit Ad Choices (US), Your Ad Choices (Canada), or Your Online Choices (EU) to find a convenient place to opt-out of interest-based advertising with participating entities for each region.  These websites also provide detailed information about how interest-based advertising works.  Opting out does not mean that you will no longer receive advertising from us, or when you use the Internet. It just means that the data collected from our website will not be used for interest-based advertising and that the advertising you see displayed on websites will not be customized to your interests. 
  Mobile Apps.  You may opt out of interest-based advertising on mobile devices by activating the "Limit Ad Tracking" or equivalent feature offered by your mobile platform. It will transmit a signal to us and to third-parties that indicates your data should not be used for interest-based advertising.
 Our Cookie and Device ID Use section provides additional options for controlling the use of particular kinds of cookies, including advertising cookies. You may use our "advertising cookies" toggle in these settings to prohibit the collection and use of Personal Data in cookies for interest-based advertising.
  





Managing Preferences and Withdrawing Consent

You may at any time withdraw your consent with future effect and without affecting the lawfulness of processing of your Personal Data based on the consent you provided before you withdrew it, and exercise other controls regarding website and online data collection, interest-based advertising, your communication settings, and app preferences.  Depending on the Service, collection and use of Personal Data may be required for the Services to work.

 Social Network Interaction and Widgets

Read More

    Social network widgets, buttons, and plug-ins on our websites passively transmit data regarding a social network's members to that social network, even when a button is not clicked.  These technologies may allow a social network (such as Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) to personally identify its members and to know the web pages its members have visited.  This is true wherever social network buttons are embedded, regardless of whether a button is "clicked" or "pressed."  If you belong to a social network or use these categories of web services, you should review the privacy policies of those services to understand the nature of the data that they collect and what, if any, options the service offers to control how data is collected and used.  If you disable advertising cookies, the passive tracking associated with these buttons will be blocked on our sites.
  


 Mobile Device Advertising IDs, Location, Sensor Data, and In-Range Device Data Use

Read More

 Our mobile apps and our Services may transmit Device IDs, Location Data, and data from sensors to us and our partners, including our advertising partners.
 Device IDs include IDs associated with your mobile device carrier such as IMEI, MEID, IMSI; platform-specific IDs such as Android ID, Google AID, and Apple's IDFA; and IDs that are part of your device hardware, such as WiFi MAC address, and serial number. Exactly which Device IDs are transmitted can depend on your mobile device platform and the version of your operating system. 
 Location Data.  Our apps and Services transmit precise Location Data. Location Data may be obtained from GPS services, cell tower triangulation, or known location of nearby WiFi access points. 
 Sensor and In-Range Device Data.  Our apps and Services may also collect Device IDs and network addresses (including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and SSIDs) from other, in-range or networked devices and WiFi Access Points. Our apps and Services may also collect information about altitude, air pressure, change in position. 
 How We Use Mobile Device Data. We may use Device IDs, coarse location and Location Data, and data from sensors, including the local network, (together with app usage data and Fitness and Wellness Data) for strictly necessary purposes; improving our apps and analytics; personalization and preferences; and cross-app, cross-device, interest-based advertising.



 Withdraw Your Consent for Use of Your Mobile Device IDs and Location Data for Analytics and Advertising

Read More

    Activating the "Limit Ad Tracking," "Opt out of Ads Personalization," or equivalent setting from your mobile device will transmit a signal to us and any third parties that we use (the signal will apply to all of our mobile apps running on that device).  When that signal is received by Under Armour or third parties, it communicates your choice to not have device IDs or Location Data used for purposes of advertising or analytics.  We honor the signal and require that our third party advertising and analytics partners do the same. 
    To the extent our mobile apps personalize functionality for you, you can change these settings within the app, or reset to defaults by deleting and reinstalling the app. 
  


 Other Ways to Manage Your Location Services
Read More
 You can also turn off the transmission of precise Location Data by turning off those services using your mobile device's built-in settings. Turning off location may cause some of our Services not to work.

 How to exercise your rights 

 Under Armour takes steps to keep your Personal Data accurate and up to date.  If you reside in the European Economic Area, you have certain rights to the Personal Data that we have collected about you.  To exercise your rights to your Personal Data, please contact us through our Support Team or at the address listed below.  Subject to applicable law and in exceptional circumstances only, we may charge for this service and we will respond to reasonable requests as soon as practicable, and in any event, within the time limits prescribed by law. 

You have the following rights:

  Right of access to your Personal Data (Art. 15 GDPR): You have the right to ask us for confirmation on whether we are processing your Personal Data, and access to the Personal Data and related information on that processing (e.g., the purposes of the processing, or the categories of Personal Data involved). 
  Right to correction (Art. 16 GDPR): You have the right to have your Personal Data corrected, as permitted by law. 
   Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR): You have the right to ask us to delete your Personal Data, as permitted by law.  This right may be exercised among other things:  (i) when your Personal Data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed; (ii) when you withdraw consent on which processing is based according to Art. 6 (1) (a) or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR and where there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii) when you object to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or when you object to the processing pursuant to Art. 21 (2) GDPR; or, (iv) when your Personal Data has been unlawfully processed.  
   Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR): You have the right to request the limiting of our processing under limited circumstances, including:  when the accuracy of your Personal Data is contested; when the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your Personal Data and request the restriction of the use of your Personal Data instead; or when you have objected to processing pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of Under Armour override your grounds. 
   Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR): You have the right to receive the Personal Data that you have provided to us, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and you have the right to transmit that information to another controller, including to have it transmitted directly, where technically feasible.

This right is limited to processing based on Art. 6 (1) (e) or (f) GDPR, and includes profiling based on those provisions, and processing for direct marketing purposes. After which, we will no longer process your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.


  How we may disclose your Personal Data 
 The GDPR and national laws of European Union member states implementing the Regulation permit the sharing of Personal Data relating to users who are residents of the European Economic Area with third parties only under certain circumstances. If you reside in the European Economic Area, we will only share your Personal Data as described in our Privacy Policy under the heading "How We Disclose Personal Data" if we are permitted to do so under applicable European and national data protection laws and regulations.

  Health Data 
 Some Fitness and Wellness Data that we collect -namely, the amount of hours an Athlete sleeps and his or her heart rate measurements-may be considered personal health data under the GDPR and its interpretation by the European data protection supervisory authorities if recorded over a longer period of time. We use Athlete sleep data to help you track your sleep patterns over time, coach you on improving your sleep habits, and help you better understand how your sleep may be impacting your performance as you strive to meet your fitness and wellness objectives. Two types of heart rate measurements may be captured via certain devices that integrate and operate with our Services - your resting heart rate (RHR) and the heart rates you generate during your workouts. This heart rate data is designed to provide you with additional information that you can incorporate into your evaluation of your progress toward your fitness and wellness objectives; it should not, however, be considered professional medical advice and is not intended to be used for diagnostic purposes. 

  Under Armour Privacy Shield Statements 

 Under Armour Inc. has self-certified that it complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework ("Privacy Shield") and the Swiss-U.S.- Privacy Shield regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from European Union member states and Switzerland. 
Under Armour Inc.'s Privacy Shield certifications do not extend to the Under Armour connected fitness apps (e.g., the certifications do not cover data collected using any of the MapMyFitness, UA Record, Endomondo, or MyFitnessPal apps).  We have implemented other mechanisms to legitimize transfers of Personal Data from the Under Armour apps to the United States. 
For EU and Swiss Personal Data received in the United States under the Privacy Shield, Under Armour has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.  If there is any conflict between the standards of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles govern.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, please visit the US Department of Commerce Privacy Shield website. To view our certification page, please visit the Privacy Shield List.
 Under the Onward Transfer Principle, we may remain liable for the processing of European Personal Data that we transfer to our third party agents or service providers.  In some instances, we may also be required to disclose Personal Data to comply with valid requests from public authorities, including for national security or law enforcement purposes.
In compliance with the Privacy Shield, Under Armour commits to resolve your complaints concerning data privacy and our collection or use of your Personal Data.  We welcome you to bring any concerns directly to us through our Support Team. Eligible unresolved privacy complaints related to violations of the Privacy Shield Principles can be reported to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and Canada.  If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Under Armour, please visit https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield for information on how to file a complaint with JAMS.
 Note that if your complaint is not resolved through either a direct interaction with Under Armour, or JAMS, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.
 For the purposes of enforcing compliance with the Privacy Shield, Under Armour is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal Trade Commission.
