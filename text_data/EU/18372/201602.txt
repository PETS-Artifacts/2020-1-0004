GeoGebra Privacy Policy
Last Updated: August 26, 2013
Welcome to the website and online services (the "Website") of the non-profit organization International GeoGebra Institute and
    GeoGebra GmbH ("GeoGebra"). 
This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use that information, and what we do to protect
    it. By using the Website (whether or not you are a registered user), you expressly consent to the information handling practices
    described in this policy. If you do not want information about you to be used in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy, please
    do not use the Website.
Your use of the Website and any personal information you provide on the Website are subject to the terms
    of this Privacy Policy and GeoGebra's Terms of Service.
    Any capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Terms of Service.
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, GeoGebra puts in place certain features designed to help protect the
    personally identifiable information of children less than 13 years of age. GeoGebra does not knowingly permit any person less than 13 years of age to register
    directly for the Website unless GeoGebra reasonably believes, or has received assurances from a Teacher that the child's parent or legal guardian has consented
    to such registration and use of the Website. If GeoGebra learns that personally-identifiable information of persons less than 13 years of age has been collected
    on the Website without parental consent, then GeoGebra will take the appropriate steps to delete this information. If you are a parent or legal guardian and
    discover that your child under the age of 13 has a registered account with the Website without your consent, then you may alert GeoGebra at
    ILF.SL2YIFYI@LYKAS42YX@     and request that GeoGebra delete that child's personal information from its systems.
The Information GeoGebra Collects
User-provided Information: When you register for, browse and use the Website, you may provide to GeoGebra what is generally called "personally identifiable
    information" (such as your full name, email address, postal mailing address, and/or home/mobile telephone number). You may also be able to add a picture
    of yourself. If you decide to register through or otherwise grant access to a third party social networking or integrated service that we may make
    available ("Integrated Service"), such as Microsoft, Facebook, or Google, GeoGebra may also collect any such "personally identifiable information" that
    you have provided to the Integrated Service from the account you have with the Integrated Service. You may revoke GeoGebra's access to your account on the
    Integrated Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Integrated Service. You should check
    your privacy settings on each Integrated Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Integrated Service. Please review each
    Integrated Serviceâ€™s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Website. From time to time, GeoGebra may
    also ask you optionally to provide other information. If you choose to provide such information, during registration or otherwise, you are giving GeoGebra
    the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand that when you sign in to the Website, you are not anonymous to us.
Information from other Users: We may make available certain features in the Website that allow other Users of the Website to provide us information that may
    include your personally identifiable information. For example, we may permit a Teacher to register an account for you on your behalf in which the Teacher
    pre-populates certain profile information about you.
"Cookies" Information: When you visit the Website, whether or not you are a registered user,
    we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Cookies remember information about your
    activities on a website. GeoGebra may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie
    remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review
    your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies you will not have access to certain services
    and features on the Website.
"Automatically Collected" Information: When you use the Website, we may automatically record certain information
    from your browser by using different types of technology, including standard log files, "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected"
    information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data,
    operating system and the dates and times that you visit the Website. Additionally, we may record certain information regarding your use of features that GeoGebra
    may make available on the Website, such as the number of materials you have viewed.
Third Party Web Beacons: We may also implement third party content,
    such as advertising, on the Website that uses "clear gifs," "web beacons," or other similar techniques, which allow the third party content provider to read
    and write cookies to your browser, or implement similar tracking mechanisms, in connection with your viewing of that third party content displayed on the Website.
    This information is collected directly by the third party, and GeoGebra does not participate in that data transmission. Information collected by third parties in this
    manner is subject to that third party's own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.
Location Information:We may collect and store information about
    your location if you enable your computer or mobile device to send us location information. You may be able to change the settings on your computer or mobile device
    to prevent it from providing us with such information.
Information from Other Sources:We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable
    information, from third parties and sources other than the Website. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information
    that we collect through the Website, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
The Way GeoGebra Uses Information
GeoGebra uses the information that you provide or that we collect in order to establish and enhance our relationship with you. GeoGebra generally uses the information
    you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on the Website. If you have given GeoGebra consent,
    we may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about GeoGebra's features, services and other offerings that may be of interest
    to you. We may also send information or offers to groups of users on behalf of other businesses. Under certain circumstances (for example if you win a contest)
    we may post your personally identifiable information on the Website. However, we will notify you of this possibility when collecting personally identifiable
    information or we will obtain your consent. We may share your personally identifiable information with certain other websites that we link to (and that you
    click upon) in order to enhance your experience in connection with the Website.
GeoGebra uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect
    from Users to understand and analyze the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the Website works and looks, and to create new
    features and functionality.
GeoGebra may use "cookies" information to: (a) remember your information so that you will not have to re-enter it
    during your visit or the next time you visit the Website; (b) provide customized third-party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor the
    effectiveness of third-party marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed; and (e)
    track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.
If you have registered as a user and given GeoGebra consent,
    we may share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with GeoGebra who would
    like to send you information about their products and services. We do not share personally identifiable information with other third-party organizations
    for their marketing or promotional use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in.
GeoGebra's employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable information you may provide to
    register as a user of the Website. We may share your personally identifiable information with companies that provide services to us, including outside
    contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (for example, contest and sweepstakes administration), but they may only use your personally
    identifiable information to provide us with a specific service and not for any other purpose.
When GeoGebra Discloses Information

    that you choose to register as a Teacher and Users associated with your Educational Organization. GeoGebra may also permit you to share your User Postings publicly
    on the Website. If your User Postings are shared with other Users, any personally identifiable information that you choose to include in, or is associated with,
    such User Postings will be accessible by such Users. Once you make your personally identifiable information available to others in any of these ways, it may be
    collected and used by the recipients without restriction. GeoGebra enables Users to share information and resources. If you are a User subscribing to the Website and

    and preferences at any time by going to your account settings page.To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your

Third Party Applications
GeoGebra endeavors to make the educational materials and content available through Website as broadly available as possible. To encourage this, GeoGebra makes available
    to third party application developers and service providers ("App Developers") an application programming interface ("API") for use in creating complementary

    access a variety of personal information related to your use of the Website and related services, including your username or other unique identifier, messages,
    comments, browsing history on the Website and other information related to your use of the Website. When you use, download or access an application or service
    from such App Developers, we may give them access to such personal information you have provided or we have collected. The first time an App Developer wishes
    to access your information through the API for a particular service or application, you will first be given the option to approve such access to your information
    by such service or application. You understand that you may not have access to certain features or services if you choose to not provide such access to your
    information to App Developers.You understand and agree that such App Developers may use this information for its internal business purposes in operating
    its services and may also disclose such information to its other customers and users. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party
    services and application. GeoGebra's privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such App Developers.
