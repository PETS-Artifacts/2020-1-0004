How do I send Moves from iPhone App to Movescount?
      To be able to send your Moves to Movescount please do the following steps:
       
Input your email address in Movescount App settings. Use the same address you are already using in Movescount. If you are a new user, use the address you wish to use to log in the Movescount.com. Then exit settings.
Open your Movescount account and allow Movescount iPhone application in your scoreboard. If you are a new user, please first check your email for a message from Movescount. In that message you have instructions how you can finish your registration before you can allow the App.
Ready! Just go out and track your Move and it will be saved also to your Movescount account.


        Note! if you cannot see Allow message in your Movescount scoreboard please re-check the email address you typed in! You can also create a Move with iPhone App to make it send data to Movescount. If you cannot see the email in your inbox please check that it is not marked as junk mail.
      
How can I merge iPhone Move to another Move?
      If you have 2 Moves made at the same time and only other one contains a track it is possible to merge the Moves. What to do:

       
Select the Move where you want to add the track
Select MERGE option on top of the Move (option is active only if there is a Move available for merging)
Movescount will propose merging, you still need to accept it. You can also decide whether you want to keep the original Move with track or not (usually you shouldn't keep it to avoid duplicates).

How can I stop tracking?
      After the tracking is started Movescount iPhone application locks screen automatically. You can unlock it by swiping the lock from left to right at the bottom of the screen. After that you should see buttons for stopping and locking.
