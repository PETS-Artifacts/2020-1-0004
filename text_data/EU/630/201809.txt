C. Personal Information Collected From your Device via Automated Means
Using the Service. When you use the Service, we collect information about your activities, such as the stations, artists or channels that you listen to, the User profiles that you view, your searches for friends or stations and your other actions and interactions with other Users or content on the Service, the stations, content and people that you follow (“Follow Lists”), your comments, any content that you post on the Service, and any other information resulting from your use of the Service that is publicly accessible by other Users (“Public Information”).
Your Contacts. If you give us permission to import to the Service the contacts from any email account associated with your account, then we may collect information about your contacts. We may also collect your contacts if you share information or content with them from the Service or invite them to use the Service.
Location Information. With your consent, we may obtain information about your physical location at regular intervals when you use the Service, such as by use of geolocation features in the device(s) through which you access the Service.  In addition, we may infer your location from other information we collect (for example, your IP address indicates the general geographic region from which you are connecting to the Internet). We use location information to comply with radio stations’ content licenses (which are location-specific), and to provide you with features, notifications, advertising, or other content that is influenced by your location (such as showing you your local radio station). 
Device Information. We receive information from Users’ devices through which a User accesses the Service, such as IP address, web browser type, mobile operating system version, and unique device identifiers. 
Widget Information. Other websites may integrate TuneIn widgets (such as the TuneIn Player or TuneIn Follow Button). When you visit a site with a TuneIn widget embedded, we may receive certain information, including information about the web page you visited, your IP address, and other information about your device. TuneIn and the widget can recognize you across websites containing TuneIn widgets, and the widget may be used to show personalized content or advertising. We know when you interact with a widget, and websites containing the widgets may receive this information.
