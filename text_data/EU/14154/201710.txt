                    service or technical support, and/or (9) newsletters. Personal information collected may include
                    your name, home address, phone number and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to
                    gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services,
                    or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.

                    valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.
                
Actual credit card/payment data is not stored by Star Stable Entertainment AB but by our international
                    hosted payment solution providers that are regulated and conform to the high level of security to be
                    able to store information of this nature.

                    aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or

                    We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions.

                    We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to
                    do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an
                    email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.
                

                    Customer Service
                

                    Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming

                    inviting him or her to visit the website. Star Stable Entertainment AB does not store this
                    information and uses it for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and to track the
                    success of our referral program.
                
Who is collecting your information?

                    When you are asked for information while on a Star Stable Entertainment AB's website, you are
                    sharing that information with Star Stable Entertainment AB, and its various affiliates unless
                    specifically stated otherwise. As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from
                    any of Star Stable’s affiliates. From time to time, Star Stable Entertainment AB may use third
                    party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and
                    prize fulfillment, credit card processing, etc.).
                

                    In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal
                    information is being collected by a company other than Star Stable Entertainment AB and not on
                    Star Stable Entertainment AB’s behalf, you will be notified at the time the information is
                    collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of
                    information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.
                

                   Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data,
                    and as such we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as
                    Star Stable Entertainment AB.
                

                    Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our websites may collect
                    personal information about you. And remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot
                    control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to carefully
                    read the privacy policy of any advertiser or website you visit.
                

                    Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook "Like" button, and
                    widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites.
                    These features may collect your Internet protocol (“IP”) address, which page you are visiting
                    on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media
                    features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites.
                    Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.
                
With whom may your personal information be shared?

                    Star Stable Entertainment AB will share your personal information with third parties only in the
                    ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third
                    parties. We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information
                    with third parties.
                

                    We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases
                    when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact,
                    or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for
                    a Star Stable Entertainment AB website or product, or may be causing injury to or interference
                    (intentionally or unintentionally) with Star Stable Entertainment AB's rights or property, other
                    users of a Star Stable Entertainment AB website or product, or anyone else who could be harmed
                    by your activities. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have
                    a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.
                

                    As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of Star Stable Entertainment AB
                    and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal
                    information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you
                    can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as
                    little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
                    bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Star Stable
                    Entertainment AB's successor or assign.
                

                    Star Stable Entertainment AB websites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas,
                    where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board,
                    forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line
                    and the user does so at his or her own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our
                    community forums, you may contact us at privacy@starstable.com to request removal. In some cases,
                    we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we
                    are unable to do so and why.
                
What choices do I have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of my personal information?

                    Star Stable Entertainment AB allows you to control the way that we use personal identifying
                    information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, Star Stable
                    Entertainment AB may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about
                    new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the "mailings" Star Stable Entertainment
                    AB may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings.
                
What are tracking technologies and how are they used?

                   As is true with most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.
                    This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
                    provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.
                    We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect
                    about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics,
                    or website functionality.
                

                    Star Stable and our partners, such as marketing partners and analytics providers, may use tracking
                    technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing
                    trends, administering the websites, tracking users’ movements around the websites, and to gather
                    demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use
                    of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well aggregated basis.
                

                    We use cookies for various purposes including our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings
                    (e.g. language preference), and for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the
                    individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our websites, but your
                    ability to use some features or areas of our websites may be limited.
                

                    We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by
                    recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
                    of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally
                    identifiable information.
                

                    We, and third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our websites or to display
                    advertising based on your web browsing activity, use Local Shared Objects such as Flash cookies, and
                    Local Storage such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may
                    offer their own management tools for removing HTML5
                

                   We partner with third party ad networks to either display advertising on our websites or to manage
                    our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partners may use tracking technologies to collect
                    non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to
                    provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you wish to not have this
                    information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking here.
                    If you are located in the European Union, click here. Please note this does not opt you out of
                    being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.
                
What are Internet protocol addresses?

                   An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service
                    Provider ("ISP"). Star Stable Entertainment AB may track such IP addresses for system administration,
                    to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from
                    being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.
                
What do I do if I want to correct or delete my personal information?

                    If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information, or would
                    like to correct or request that we delete such personal information, please contact Star Stable
                    Entertainment AB, Attention: Privacy Policy Administrator, Jakobsbergsgatan 31, 111 44 Stockholm,

                    In some cases, we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use our
                    information as long as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or
                    enforce our agreements.
                

                    Please note that the deletion of your data will lead to the termination of your account and all
                    applicable services.
                
How secure is my personal information?

                    The security of your personal information is important to us. Star Stable Entertainment has taken
                    steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e.
                    free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When
                    credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL
                    (secure sockets layer) encryption. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
                    information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
                

                    In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any
                    data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.
                
What if I have a question or complaint?
