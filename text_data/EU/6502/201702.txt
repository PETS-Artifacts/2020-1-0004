4. Provision of services and disclosure of data
We will use the information provided to us by you to search the websites of our partners in order to obtain the best quotes available to you.
We may use your data to send you a confirmation email of your quote.
To help improve our services we and our partners may also use your data (which may include data you have provided as part of your quotation or information we collect about how you use our website) for the purposes of marketing research and data analysis. This helps us and our partners to develop and improve the products and services that are offered.
Data will also be used to track sales and to administer our reward scheme which may involve us sharing data which relates to the product that you have purchased with your product provider.  Your product provider may also provide us with any information that they hold relating to the product you have purchased for this purpose. Please read the Privacy & Cookie Policy for  www.comparethemeerkat.com which contains further details regarding the reward scheme.   
We may use third parties to process personal information on our behalf. Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will ensure that they have the necessary high standards of security in place so that your data is kept secure and only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.   
We will release your personal information when we are required to do so for legal or regulatory purposes or as part of legal proceedings.
Driving Licence Number
If you provide your driving licence number this may be passed to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver’s) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out as part of your quote and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or your named driver’s) driving licence record. For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit www.dvla.gov.uk. Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. The searches may be carried out by the insurers directly or we may carry out the search and pass the relevant information to the insurers for these purposes. This is a new scheme which is being rolled out. If you provide your driving licence number before the scheme is operational, we will keep your driving licence number so that it may be used for future quotes.

5.   Communicating with you
It is very important to us that we provide a service that meets the expectations of our customers and this section will explain how we and our partners will use your data to communicate with you.
Quote Confirmation When you obtain a quote with us, you will automatically be sent confirmation of your quote by email or SMS so that you have a record of your quote and can easily retrieve your quote in the future. This is a standard part of the service that we offer and by using the service you agree to receive these communications.
Updates from comparethemarket.com Where you tell us you are happy to receive information from us we may send you communications from comparethemarket.com which may include the following:- - Newsletters - Further information about the services we offer - New product launches - Reminders when you products may be due for renewal - Updates on our rewards programme - Opportunities to participate in market research 
Depending on the contact preferences you select, we will communicate with you by post, telephone, SMS, email or other electronic means such as via social and digital media.
We may also use your data to allow us to show your adverts while you are on-line that are relevant to you. Sometimes, we will use cookies to do this and you can find out more about this and how to turn off cookies by reading our cookie policy.
If you don’t want to receive communications from us you can let us know at any time by contacting us at feedback or you can select your contact preferences in Your Account.
Renewal Reminders As part of our service, we may also contact you around the anniversary of when you completed your quote in order to provide you with an indication of what your quotes could be for your next renewal. We will use the data that we hold on you in order to search the websites of our partners in order to do this. Some of our partners will carry out credit and data checks as part of this process (see paragraph 6 below for further information on the type of checks that may be undertaken).
Communications from our partners With some of the comparison services we offer, you will have the option during the journey to select whether you would like to receive further communications from our partners (e.g. insurance providers, product providers or brokers) to discuss your quote further. 
Otherwise, we will not pass any of your information to our partners for marketing purposes and we have contractual arrangements in place with all our partners which prevent them using your information for this purpose. If you click through to our any of our partners’ websites, you will be subject to their Privacy Policy in relation to any communications you will receive from them which we recommend you read carefully.

6. Credit and data checks
Some of our product and service providers will carry out checks with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies in order to verify your identity, assess your application for a quotation or credit and offer you the best terms.  The checks may be against both public data (such as information from the electoral roll) and private data (such as your credit history). The providers do not make these checks purely because you are using our service, and may make them if you request a quote via any other source. As part of the quote process, some product providers will exchange information with various industry databases in order to verify the information that you have provided such as the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), the Hunter Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register or the No Claims Discount Database.    Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.
A record of the search will appear on your credit report. Some product providers may also carry out checks against data they already hold on you (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies) such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data. They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums.  They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.

7. Crime and fraud prevention
We may share data (including electronic identifiers such as IP addresses) with third parties including our product and service providers or the police and fraud prevention agencies if we believe that it is reasonably required for the prevention or detection of crime or fraud or to protect our customers. Data may also be released to third parties if we are required to do so under the terms of a court order.

8. Sensitive personal data
In order to provide you with a quote we may need to collect personal data which the Data Protection Act 1998 defines as sensitive, such as medical history or criminal convictions. By proceeding with obtaining a quote you will signify your explicit consent to such information being processed by ourselves and our product or service providers for the purposes stated above.

9. Overseas transfer of data
From time to time it may be necessary for us to undertake some of the processing of your personal data in other countries outside of the European Economic Area where data protection safeguards are not as high as they are in the UK. However, where this is necessary we will ensure that your data is kept securely and only processed in accordance with the Data Protection Act.   It is also possible that some of our product and service providers will process your data in other countries, however we require all our partners to ensure that your data is kept securely at all times.
