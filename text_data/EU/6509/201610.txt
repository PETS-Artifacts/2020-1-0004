If you have bought or enquired about our products or services, created an account or registered on the site we may use the information we collect to let you know about other products and services which may be of interest to you and to keep you updated with information about promotional offers and what is coming soon at Wickes.
You will be able to let us know if you no longer want to receive material from us each time you receive something, as all the marketing we send you will include instructions on how to stop receiving such items. Bear in mind that if you opt out of text or email marketing you may not receive voucher codes and other offers.Understanding Our Customers
So that we can provide a better service, we want to understand the shopping patterns of our customers, how customers select the products and services they ultimately buy, which apps and technology customers prefer to use, and how successful our advertising and promotional campaigns have been. We may use a number of different techniques to do this:

- We never see or store your payment card details. We do use a unique encrypted token that can tell the same payment card is used in different places (in store, online or on the Wickes app). This helps us build a complete picture of all the things people buy from Wickes; 
- We monitor which customers redeem vouchers using a code that makes the offer personal to you; 
- When you order goods in store to be delivered, we will ask for your marketing choices as we would like to send you information about other products and services that may be of interest. We may also link your in-store order details with your online account information and your shopping patterns on our website and mobile app so we have a complete picture of all the things you buy from Wickes; 
- We may monitor other websites you visit and the goods and services you look for using search engines in order to provide you with information about products and services from Wickes which are most relevant to you; 
- We may connect with social media sites so that we can better target our advertising while you are using these services and improve the relevance of what you see. 
We also use cookies to track online activity. You can find out more about this in our Cookies Policy. The information collected by cookies does not in itself identify a visitor to our site but if you are a customer or account holder we may be able to identify you from both sets of information combined.Disclosing your data
