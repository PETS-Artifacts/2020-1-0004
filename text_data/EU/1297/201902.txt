Manage Personal Player Names


						Configure your own poker player names here.
					

						If you choose to add a reset date to one of your player names, all users (including yourself) will not be able to view any results that occurred before the chosen reset date. Your player name will however have an icon next to it showing that a reset is in place. Resets do not affect leaderboards.
					




Set Blog URL

Gold subscribers can specify their blog URL and a linked blog icon will appear next to your player name when it is searched or listed on a leaderboard as long as your subscription is active.
					

NOTES:

These links are exclusively for your own player names which have been configured in the Manage Personal Player Names section.
They are only for personal blogs (and not those hosted on a tuition site). Webmasters of tuition sites should contact us by email for pricing.
URLs will be validated before display to confirm the blog is genuine.
