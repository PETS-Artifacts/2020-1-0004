The Imaging Resource Privacy Policy
The Imaging Resource does not collect any user specific identifiable
information other than what the user specifically volunteers. For example, this
information may be volunteered when you register for the forums or subscribe to
the newsletter. We do not use this information for any purpose
other than its intended use (to allow posting in the forums, to allow sending
of the newsletter to a specific email address, etc.) We don't resell names or
any individual data. We may report demographic information in the aggregate,
but don't share information on individual readers. 
A possible exception to the above may occur when a company sponsors
a sweepstakes or contest. In these cases the company is generally entitled to
the raw data collected for the sweepstakes/survey.
The Imaging Resource collects some non user specific information
such as the type of browser and operating system used. This information is used
to assist us internally to provide the best site design and format for our users.
We don't share any data that may be uniquely linked to any of our readers outside the IR organization.
