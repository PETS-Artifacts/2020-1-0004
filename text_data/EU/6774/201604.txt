We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your personal information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. Your personal information may be transferred to a buyer or other successor in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event in which personal information held by us about our site users is among the assets transferred.
Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. For instance, we use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies are not permitted to use any personal information that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us.
Legal Requirements: We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our site.
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that personal data that is relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. This means that we only collect information that is necessary for us to provide you with our services through our website. Furthermore, we will not process your personal information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.
