1. Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs
Because we realize that privacy policies tend to be long and not terribly exciting, we’ve developed these FAQs to provide shortcuts to certain information in our Privacy Policy.  These shortcuts are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices we provide in our complete Privacy Policy. The complete version of our Privacy Policy governs our collection, use, storage and sharing of information we collect or receive from you.
Q: I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?
A: You can access and update your account info by logging into the Unity Store and navigating to the My Account page.  We collect Log Info, including IP Address and device data, related to your visits to our site.  We use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order for Unity to improve its software and services.  We also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the Software which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software.  You should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity.  If you use Unity developer services such as mobile advertising and analytics, read the applicable FAQs below and our Cookie Policy.
Q: I use the forums on the Unity web site, what should I know?
A: When you post comments on our forums, visitors and other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.
Q: I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?
A:  Unity has probably collected some or all of the following information about your device: Unique device identifier generated from the device MAC/IMEI/MEID (which we immediately convert into a different number using a one way hash); IP address; Device manufacturer and model; the operating system and version running on your system or device; browser type; language; the make of the CPU, and number of CPUs present; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (example: "nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71"); which graphics API is in use (example: "OpenGL 2.1" or "Direct3D 9.0c"); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Player; version of the Unity Editor used to create the content; a number describing whether the player is running on Mac, Windows or other platforms; and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it did transmit correctly; application or bundle identification ("app id") of the game installed.  Some Unity developers use Unity’s analytics and ad services which collect additional information. See FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below.
Q: That seems like a lot of data, why so much?
A: We try to limit the collection of this information from any one player or device; however, certain operating systems do not permit us to note that the info has already been collected.  This means that the data may be sent to Unity each time you start the game.  We use the information to make decisions about which platforms, operating systems and versions of them should be supported by our game development software.  We aggregate this data and make it available to developers at stats.unity3d.com. This data helps us improve our Services and helps developers improve their apps.
Q: I play a game that uses Unity Analytics, what do I need to know?
A: At the developer’s request, Unity has collected device information, like IP Address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications, the value and details of purchases.  Using our systems the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data.  Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games.  These reports are based, in part, on your information, but do not specifically identify you or your device.  If the developer uses Unity Analytics, the game was built using Unity’s game development software so be sure to review FAQ # 1.
Q: I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?
A: Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP Address and device identifiers, as well as information regarding the delivery of the ad and your interaction with it, which will be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.  If Unity provides personalized advertising, it will provide you notice and an ability to opt-out of such interest based advertising.  Please review our Cookie Policy to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.
Q: What are device identifiers, like IDFA or fingerprints, and why do you collect them?
A: Like many other providers of mobile apps instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user’s device.  Device IDs are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.  For example, if we want to effectively limit the number of ads a particular device receives about our apps, we or an ad network delivering ads on our behalf needs to recognize the device across apps.
Q: I use Unity’s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?
A: Unity has probably collected one or more device identifiers and your IP address as well as your activity within the service. If you have created an account with Unity’s game replay service, Unity has received any information you actively provided when setting up your account, including email address and username.  Our primary use of your data will be provision of the game replay platform and all its features, including analysis and improvement.  You can access and update your account info by visiting Everyplay and navigating to the user settings page.  Also:

When you create an account or profile your username, profile photo, cover photo, user description, users that you follow and users that follow you will all be public, which means that anyone can see that information and we may share it.
Replays that are set to public will be viewable by anyone AND the service or the relevant Developer may use the replay to promote the service or the relevant game.
When you comment on, share or like a replay using the Unity game replay platform, your replay, including any audio or video narration you attached to the replay, like or comments will be visible to others.  
When you share a replay on a social network - depending on your privacy settings at the relevant social network, some users of the relevant social network will see the replay.

Q: I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store, what do I need to know?
A: Unity has probably collected information about your device, including IP Address, and your use of the site as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and ensuring that you are paid in accordance with our agreement. Other uses might include, sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.  You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page.  Also, when you publish or provide assets for license on the Asset Store your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.
Q: I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store, what should I know?
A: Unity has probably collected information about your device, including IP Address, and your use of the site as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.  Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased.  Other uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.  You can access and update your account info by logging in to Asset Store and visiting your My Account page.
Q: I play a game published by Unity, what should I know?

2. Privacy Policy overview
Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively “Unity”) offer a variety of products and services for game developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the “Service” or “Services.”  Because we’d like to avoid excessive formality and to make this policy more readable, the policy will often refer to Unity as “we” or “us” and to the reader as “you” or a User. When we say “device” we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that is used to access the Service.  When we say “Developer”, we mean a third party that develops and/or distributes a game or other app made with Unity software and/or a game using Unity services.  By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and that we may transfer your data to the United States.
This privacy policy governs our information practices for the Service, which includes any websites, where a link to this policy is provided. It describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information from Developers, Players, ad recipients, or people browsing our sites (collectively “Users”), when Users interact with or use our Service. This includes when Users:

Visit Unity websites
License and download Unity’s game and app development software (“Unity Software”) 
License and download third party assets from, or offer your assets in, the Unity Asset Store accessed from the Unity Software
Use Unity Developer services such as Unity Cloud Build, Unity Analytics and Unity Ads

Play games that are distributed or published by Unity

We receive information about Users, their devices, locations and interactions with the Service primarily in two ways:

Actively: When Users actively provide us with information. For example, when a player creates an account with Unity, he or she will type in a name, user name and email address and may be required to provide a date of birth.
Passively: When our systems automatically collect information about browsers and devices and certain activity within the Service. For example, when players access games that employ Unity Analytics, our systems (with assistance from the Developers who want our help to analyze the use of their games) may automatically collect a variety of information, including device name, device fingerprint and other unique identifiers from User devices and/or User game activity. 

3. Information we may collect or receive (depending on which product or service is used)
Information that you or others actively provide, including:
