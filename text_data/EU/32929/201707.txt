ResDiary does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. ResDiary may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, ResDiary may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to ResDiary, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.
ResDiary will collect data, including without limitation from you, with the purpose of improving the booking service and to provide feedback to the restaurant. The data may also be used to present a quality index for the restaurant industry. ResDiary may collate and share aggregated or de-identified information at its absolute discretion, including but not limited to aggregate statistical data.
ResDiary keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within ResDiary, in order to determine what ResDiary services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within ResDiary to customers whose behaviour indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
Resdiary websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on ResDiary or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of ResDiary; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of ResDiary, or the public.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the ResDiary services or websites you visit.
