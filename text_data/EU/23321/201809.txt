1. IntroductionFor German and French version see Other forms and documents – Regional documents1.1 In order to service our clients Saxo Bank A/S (hereinafter “Saxo Bank” “we” or “us”) needs to collect personal data from our clients and /or potential clients and employees.In light of the above, Saxo Bank wants to ensure a high level of data protection as privacy is a cornerstone in gaining and maintaining the trust of our clients, employees and suppliers and thus, ensuring Saxo Bank’s future business.Protection of personal data requires that appropriate technical and organisational measures are taken to demonstrate a high level of data protection. Saxo Bank has adopted a number of internal and external data protection policies, which must be followed by employees of Saxo Bank.Additionally, Saxo Bank will monitor, audit and document internal compliance with the data protection policies and applicable statutory data protection requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).Saxo Bank will also take the necessary steps in order to enhance data protection compliance within the organisation. These steps include the assignment of responsibilities, raising awareness and training of staff involved in processing operations. Please note that this privacy policy will be reviewed from time to time to take into account any new obligations. Retention and processing of personal data will be governed by our most recent policy.This privacy policy, along with guidelines for processing of personal data, constitutes the overall framework for processing of personal data within Saxo Bank.1.2 “Personal data” is any information which may be related to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, location data, phone number, age, gender, an employee, a job applicant, clients, suppliers and other business partners. This also includes special categories of personal data (sensitive personal data) and confidential information such as health information, account number, identification number, location data, an online identifier or one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.1.3 Although information regarding companies/businesses is not as such personal data, please note that information relating to contacts within such companies/businesses, e.g. name, title, work email, work phone number, etc. is considered personal data.1.4 Saxo Bank collects and uses personal data for a variety of legitimate business purposes, including establishment and management of customer and supplier relationships, completion of purchase agreements, recruitment and management of all aspects of terms and conditions of employment, communication, fulfilment of legal obligations or requirements, performance of contracts, providing services to clients, etc.1.5 Personal data shall always be:Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject;collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes;adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed;accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay;kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed;processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.1.6 Saxo Bank shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with the above as part of Saxo Bank’s accountability.2. Legal basis for the processing personal data2.1 Processing of personal data requires a legal basis. The most predominant legal basis for processing personal data within Saxo Bank are:Consent from the data subject(s) for one or more specific purposes;The performance of a contract to which the data subject is party;A legal obligation or requirement;Legitimate interests pursued by Saxo Bank;2.2 Consent2.2.1 If the collection, registration and further processing of personal data on clients, suppliers, other business relations and employees are based on such a person’s consent to the processing of personal data for one or more specific purposes, Saxo Bank shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of such personal data.2.2.2 Consent shall be: freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous.  The data subject must actively consent to the processing of personal data by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.2.2.3 A request for consent shall be presented in a manner, which is clearly distinguishable from other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.2.2.4 To process special categories of personal data (sensitive personal data) the consent shall also be explicit.2.2.5 The data subject is entitled to withdraw his/her consent at any time and upon such withdrawal, we will stop collecting and/or processing personal data about that person unless we are obligated or entitled to do so based on another legal basis.2.3 Performance of a contract:2.3.1 It will be legitimate to collect and process personal data relevant to the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This applies to all contractual obligations and agreements signed with Saxo Bank, including the pre-contractual phase irrespective of the success of the contract negotiation.2.4 Compliance with a legal obligation2.4.1 Saxo Bank must comply with various legal obligations and requirements, which are based on Union or Member State law. Such legal obligations, to which Saxo Bank is subject, may be sufficient as a legitimate basis for the processing of personal data.2.4.2 Such legal obligations include obligations to collect, register and/or make available certain types of information relating to employees, clients, etc. Such legal requirements will then form the legal basis for us to process the personal data, however, it is important to note whether the provisions allowing or requiring Saxo Bank to process certain personal data also set out requirements in relation to storage, disclosure and deletion.2.5 Legitimate interests2.5.1 Data will only be processed where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by Saxo Bank, and these interests or fundamental rights are not overridden by the interests of the data subject. Saxo Bank will, when deciding to process data, ensure that the legitimate interests does not override the rights and freedoms of the individual and that the processing will not cause unwarranted harm. An example of legitimate interest of Saxo Bank is to process personal data on potential clients in order to expand the business and develop new business relations. The data subject must be given information on the specific legitimate interest if a processing is based on this provision, cf. section 4.1 below.3. Processing and transfer of personal data3.1 Saxo Bank as Data Controller3.1.1 Saxo Bank will be considered a data controller to the extent that we decide by which means the data subject’s personal data shall be processed e.g. when a data subject signs an agreement with Saxo Bank.3.2 Use of data processors3.2.1 An external data processor is a company, which processes personal data on behalf of Saxo Bank and in accordance with Saxo Bank’s instructions, e.g. in relation to HR systems, third party IT providers, etc. When Saxo Bank outsources the processing of personal data to data processors, Saxo Bank ensures that said company as a minimum applies the same degree of data protection as Saxo Bank. If this cannot be guaranteed, Saxo Bank will choose another data processor.3.3 Data processing agreements3.3.1 Prior to transfer of personal data to the data processor, Saxo Bank shall enter into a written data processing agreement with the data processor. The data processing agreement ensures that Saxo Bank controls the processing of personal data, which takes place outside Saxo Bank for which Saxo Bank is responsible.3.3.2 If the data processor/sub-data processor is located outside the EU/EEA,the conditions of clause 3.4.4 below will apply.3.4 Disclosure of personal data3.4.1 Before disclosing personal data to others, it is the responsibility of Saxo Bank to consider whether the recipient is employed by us or not.

Personal data shall only be disclosed to third parties acting as individual data controllers if a legitimate purpose for such transfer exists. If the recipient is acting as a data processor, please refer to clause 3.2 above.3.4.4 If the third party recipient is located outside the EU/EEA in a country that does not ensure an adequate level of data protection, the transfer can only be completed if a transfer agreement has been entered into between Saxo Bank and the third party.
