We may use your personal Information to market and advertise our products and services, BT group products and services and occasionally third party products and services that may be of interest to you by telephone, post, SMS, email or online or via apps.
If you want to stop or change how we use your information for marketing purposes, you can do this via the Member Centre if you’re a broadband, phone or TV customer.
We subscribe to email and direct mail lists provided by third parties and use the information for our marketing campaigns, but only where this complies with applicable laws.
As we are part of the BT group, we will share information with other BT group companies, including EE, so they can let you know about other products and services you may be interested in (but they’ll only do this where it complies with applicable laws) and to stop us all contacting you about the same things. If you would like these BT group companies to not to call or mail you with details of products, services and special offers, please call 0800 800 150 (residential customers) or 0800 400 400 (business customers).
We may also use your personal information to provide you with targeted or tailored advertising both on our and selected partner’s websites or apps. This may involve providing personal information to our partners but we always try to make sure these partners allow you to opt out of this targeted or tailored advertising.
You have the right to ask us not to process your personal information for marketing purposes. You can do this by opting out of receiving information about products and services from us when you first sign up with us, or at any other time by updating your communication preferences on the Member Centre. Also, when we carry out a marketing campaign by text or email, we’ll give you the option to ask us to not contact you again.
