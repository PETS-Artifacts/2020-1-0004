In the below we’ve detailed what personal information we’ll collect when you interact with us and the reasons why we collect it. We’ll then use your personal information for these reasons.
When you browse the Plusnet website:

What we collect: we record how you use our website (for example, where you accessed it from, where you go on our website and how long you stay on each page). We also collect information on the browsers and operating system you use. This information is anonymised so it is not linked to you specifically and isn't used to identify you.

Why we collect it: we do this so we can see whether there are problems in how people navigate around our website and work to improve the experience of using our website.


When you call us:

What we collect: when you call us we'll ask you for your name, address, phone number and email address. If you’re already a customer, we’ll also ask you some security questions (e.g. what is your username and password), and if you call about a fault we might also collect information on your router or service settings (or something similar). We’ll keep a record of the call.

Why we collect it: we ask for your name so we can speak to you in a friendly way and we ask you security questions to ensure we’re talking to the right person. Keeping a record of the call allows us to meet our legal obligations and carry out staff training and performance monitoring. We only collect information on your router or service settings (or something similar) where we’re trying to fix a fault with your service.


When you chat with us online:

What we collect: we’ll keep a record of our conversation and we’ll collect information on the length of the chat, the name you provide us and any information that you choose to disclose.

Why we collect it: we do this for training and monitoring purposes. We also may carry out some analytics on an anonymised basis to identity key trends and improve the functionality and experience of chatting with us online.


When you sign up for our service(s):

What we collect: when you sign up for a service or services with us we'll ask you for your name, address, phone number, email address, mobile number, payment information and some other general information about how you want to use the service(s) and what other services you have. We’ll ask you to create a username and a password and we’ll also create a unique identifier for you. 

Why we collect it: we ask you for this information so we’re able to place your order, contact you about your order’s progress, process your payment and provide you with the service(s).  We may also use it to check or confirm your identity. Your address and phone number, and the general information you provide on how you want to use our services, allow us to check what services we can provide you and to discuss the best service option for you.


When you use any of our services:

What we collect: our network records information on how much you use our service (for example, how long you connect to the Internet, how long you speak on the phone, and what numbers you call). We also collect information on the websites you visit. 

Why we collect it: we are not Big Brother and only want to collect this information so we can manage demand across our network, manage faults and bill you for the service. We’re legally required to keep this information. Sometimes court orders and agreements also mean we have to collect this information. The information might also be necessary if we need to contact you if you are using our service to access third party content in an unlawful way, or if we need to notify you about changes to our services (for example, to tell you that we have upgraded the service on your line, or to tell you when new technologies, such as fibre broadband, are available).


When you use Plusnet Safeguard:

What we collect: we capture and store information about whether you’ve activated Plusnet Safeguard and the settings that you’ve selected. Plusnet SafeGuard doesn’t record details of your individual Internet activity or any specific websites that might be blocked by this service. We may record anonymous and aggregated information about the websites that are blocked by Plusnet SafeGuard for the purpose of monitoring any problems or faults with the service.

Why we collect it: it is essential to collect this information for Plusnet SafeGuard to work properly.


When you take YouView TV from Plusnet:

What we collect: when you subscribe to YouView TV from Plusnet we may take details of the devices you use to connect to the service, the channels and programmes you watch, and adverts and services you access (for example, how you view, record or fast forward them). 

Why we collect it: we do this so we can provide you with a personalised service, like viewing recommendations and tailored advertising. You can turn this off but you’ll get general content recommendations and adverts. 


Further information on the YouView TV services’ use of personal information can be found in YouView’s privacy policy. 
When you use the Plusnet Community:

What we collect: we capture the information you provide when you register to be a Plusnet Community user, and any information you provide in your contributions. We also compile statistics on the usage of the Community (for example, how many visitors there are to the Community, when they visited, for how long and which areas of the Community were visited).  In respect of any personal information you may upload or post on the Community, it is your decision to do so and we don’t determine the purposes for which (and manner in which) you’ve uploaded or posted the information.

Why we collect it: we capture the registration information to be able to create your Plusnet Community account. We use information on Community usage for trend analysis purposes and to help us make improvements to the Community and to the services we make available. We don’t use this information to identify individuals visiting the Community forums.


As the Community is publically available, we’re not responsible for the security of any personal information you upload or post within the public section of the Community, or any further use of that information by third parties.
When you are referred to us by another customer:

What we collect: if you’ve been referred to us by a friend or another third party who is a Plusnet customer, we’ll let them know you’ve become a customer.

Why we collect it: we do this so they can receive their referral bonus. If someone has referred you to us, we have to let them know whether they are still eligible to receive a referral bonus. As this eligibility depends on a number of things you do (for example, remaining a customer and making payments on time), this may involve indirectly letting them know certain limited information about you but we’ll never provide the exact reason why they are no longer eligible to receive a referral bonus. 


Where you use comparison or cashback service providers:

What we collect: we may collect information via cookies (see below) and other tracking devices. We may also create unique identifiers that match our records with these providers’ records. Where you sign up for service(s), either online or via the phone, through one of these providers, these providers may collect the information to sign you up for the service(s) on our behalf, rather than us collecting the information from you directly.

Why we collect it: we use the tracking information and unique identifiers to see whether you’ve been referred to us by a comparison website or cashback provider and to be able to process payments that are due. The information collected to sign you up for service(s) is collected for the same reasons as when you sign up with us directly and the When you sign up for our service(s) section provides full details on this.


Please note that these comparison websites and cashback providers have their own privacy policies and may use your personal information for wider purposes. We’d recommend you check these policies before you submit any personal information to them. 
Where you are entitled to cashback or similar rewards:

What we collect: sometimes we may also ask you to provide or confirm certain information about your account (e.g. your address or username), either to us or our third party providers who are providing the cashback or reward services. 

Why we collect it: we may ask you to provide this information so we or our third party providers can validate if you’re entitled to receive the cashback or rewards as part of one of our offers or deals.  


General:
There are couple of other circumstances where we might collect or use your personal information not covered by the above: 

We generally carry out market research and analysis on our products and services and future developments, and when we do this we'll make sure that you can't be identified after your participation in the research has ended. Sometimes our third party market research providers may contact you by text or email (where you’ve provided this information) so you can provide feedback on our customer service or our services generally, if you want to. 

We try to use dummy information to test our software but sometimes we have to use personal information. We’ll only do this where strictly necessary and in secure pre-production environments.

Sometimes court orders and legal and regulatory obligations change, which mean we have to use your personal information in different ways to comply with these requirements.

If you fail to pay us, and still don’t do so after we remind you, your details may be passed onto a third party debt collection agency. This agency may conduct certain searches with credit reference agencies (like Experian or Equifax) and of other public data sources. They do this to better understand your circumstances (such as if the details we provided are up to date or to assess your ability to make payment).  These searches may be visible to you if you check your credit record (but not to third parties, although they may be used by the credit reference agencies to inform your credit scores).

If we provide you with an email address or a static IP address we’ll use the username you use to access your account within this address, so any personal information within your username may be visible to third parties. If you ask us, we can change your static IP address so that the rDNS does not display your username.
