We sometimes use other companies to provide some of our services or to provide services to us. So that they can do this, we may need to let them process your personal information. When we do so, these companies must keep the information secure in accordance with our instructions, and must comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.
Where you ask us, we’ll pass your details to other companies who provide a directory service that is available to the public. If you prefer to remain ex-directory we won't give your number to these companies.
We may also share personal information with other members of the BT group, including EE, so as to be able to provide our services and diagnose faults where we use the BT network, for general group administration purposes such as to compile group reports and where we share support services or systems.
We may provide information to the relevant authorities (in response to properly made requests) to prevent and detect crime, to prosecute offenders, and to protect national security. In all cases, we’ll do this in line with the Data Protection Act 1998.
We also provide information when we have to do so by law (for example, under a court order) or in response to demands that have been made lawfully under legal powers.
In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.
