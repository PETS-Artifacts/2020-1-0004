5.2 Some of parties listed above may be accessing this information internationally, in countries outside the European Economic Area. Some of these countries may offer differing levels of protection of personal information, not all of which may be as high as in the UK.
5.3 We will only pass on information about you for marketing purposes to reputable third parties with your prior consent. If you give your consent, third parties may then occasionally send email communications to you to provide information, offers and services that may be of interest to you. The more Christian Connection knows about you, the more value we can offer you by way of a personalised Website. We may store certain personal information and use this to offer you personalised services, information and offers through the Website. Once you have given consent you can of course ask us and for third parties to stop providing such services to you at any time.

5.5 We are a member of the Online Dating Association (ODA).  The ODA helps to ensure the safety, and protect the vital interests, of those who use dating sites in the UK.  In helping to ensure the safety of users, if a user's actions or behaviour on Christian Connection cause us to become aware of or reasonably suspect that that the user may be guilty of, or may commit, a serious offence then we may (at our sole discretion) share information about such user (which may include sensitive personal data) and the serious offence with the ODA who may in turn share this information with other members of the ODA.  Where we do share such user's information we will only disclose such information as is strictly necessary for the purpose of the ODA and its members reviewing the serious offence and whether or not it would be appropriate to block such users them from any sites.  In certain circumstances we may disclose information about a user in relation to a serious offence to the police or users at risk where we believe it is in the vital interests of those users.  In this section the term "serious offence" includes, but is not limited to: racist, sexist or discriminatory, physically or sexually threatening actions or comments; actually or attempting to defraud other users; actions such as stalking or harassment which could cause a user serious distress; and repeated offences which in isolation are not considered serious but collectively display a pattern of behaviour which may cause other users harm or serious distress.
