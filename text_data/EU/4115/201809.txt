3. How we Use the Information that we Collect from You
We use the information collected from you to process your order. By submitting an order your personal details will be shared with the sales, customer service and warehouse fulfilment teams at Gear4music. We also need to share your data with the relevant third-party courier companies to deliver the order to your choose delivery address. 
Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only
- where we have your consent to do so,
- where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, or
- where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights.
In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you. If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences if you do not provide your information). Similarly, if we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.
We may also use your anonymised data to analyse customer activity, trends, and look at improving the customer experience and processes moving forward.Our exclusive offers and discounts by email (direct marketing)
When you register as a new customer on the Gear4music website you have the opportunity to sign up for exclusive offers and discounts by email. By ticking the ‘accept’ box, you give us your consent to send to your registered email address our regular sales newsletter and special offers, discounts and competitions. You can always opt-out later by either: logging into your account and changing your communication preferences, clicking on the “unsubscribe” link on the bottom of our emails, or contacting our customer service department. Please note, the opt-out excludes essential service messages such as order confirmation and dispatch emails.
If you registered an account before we had the opt-in box at registration you instead had chance to opt-out from our marketing emails in compliance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. As you bought something from us, gave us your contact details, and did not opt-out of marketing messages, we believe you have a legitimate interest in our products and services and are happy to receive marketing from us about similar products or services even though you haven’t specifically consented. Consequently, we will continue sending you emails after the new privacy and data protection regulations take effect on 25 May 2018. We will, of course, process your data in line with the processing principles under the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and of course, you can opt out at any time.Our abandoned checkout reminder service by email
If you created an account and leave the Gear4music websites with an item in the checkout basket before completing your journey, Gear4music will email you a reminder. For this service, we work with Ve Global UK Limited (Company No. 10706696) whose registered office is at White Collar Factory, Old Street Yard, London, EC1Y 8AF. Gear4music will share with Ve Global your email address, the transaction date, transaction ID and value. Gear4music and Ve Global are, together, joint controllers with you in respect of this service. Ve Global’s respective responsibilities in this regard are set out in their Privacy Policy under: https://www.ve.com/privacy-policy
