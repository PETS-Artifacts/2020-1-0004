Aurora's Privacy Policy
How we use your information
This privacy notice tells you what to expect when Aurora Data
Recovery (aurora) collects personal information. It applies to
information we collect about:

visitors to our websites
order forms
people who use our data recovery services
people who purchase hard disk drives
job applicants and our current and former employees

Visitors to our websites
When someone visits aurora.se we collect standard internet log
information and details of visitor behaviour patterns. We do this
to find out things such as the number of visitors to the various
parts of the site. We collect this information in a way which does
not identify anyone. We do not make any attempt to find out the
identities of those visiting any of auroras international websites.
We will not associate any data gathered from this site with any
personally identifying information from any other source. If we do
want to collect personally identifiable information through our
website, as is the case when filling in an order form, we will make
it clear when we collect personal information.
Use of cookies by aurora
Aurora uses Cookies to remember your preferred language selection.
Use of Search engine
Our website search is scripted by aurora and does not connect to
any external services. Search queries and results are logged
anonymously to help us improve our website keywords and search
functionality. No user-specific data is collected by either aurora
or any third party.
People who call our helpline
When you call aurora's data recovery helpline we collect Calling
Line Identification (CLI) information. We also make a note of the
nature of the the enquiry, together with the advice offered. We use
this information to help improve our efficiency and
effectiveness.
People who email us
Certain email sent to us, including any attachments, may be
stored. Such examples would be commercial documents, orders,
delivery information, price lists   Email monitoring or
blocking software (anti-spam or anti-virus applications) will also
be used. Please be aware that you have a responsibility to ensure
that any email you send to us is within the bounds of the law.
People who make a complaint to us
When we receive a complaint from a person we make up a file
containing the details of the complaint. This normally contains the
identity of the complainant and any other individuals involved in
the complaint.
We will only use the personal information we collect to process
the complaint and to check on the level of service we provide. We
do compile and publish statistics showing information like the
number of complaints we receive, but not in a form which identifies
anyone.
We usually have to disclose the complainantâ€™s
identity to whoever the complaint is about. This is inevitable
where, for example, the accuracy of a personâ€™s
record is in dispute. If a complainant doesnâ€™t
want information identifying him or her to be disclosed, we will
try to respect that. However, it may not be possible to handle a
complaint on an anonymous basis.
We will keep personal information contained in complaint files
in line with our retention policy. This means that information
relating to a complaint will be retained for two years from
closure. It will be retained in a secure environment and access to
it will be restricted according to the â€˜need to
knowâ€™ principle.
Similarly, where enquiries are submitted to us we will only use
the information supplied to us to deal with the enquiry and any
subsequent issues and to check on the level of service we
provide.
When we take enforcement action against someone, we may publish
the identity of the defendant in our Annual Report or elsewhere.
Usually we do not, identify any complainants unless the details
have already been made public.
People who use auroras data recovery
services
Aurora offers various services to the public.
We have to hold the details of the people who have requested our
service in order to provide it. However, we only use these details
to provide the service the person has requested and for other
closely related purposes.
When businesses fill in their registration forms, they are asked
to provide the contact details of a relevant member of staff. Aurora
will use this for its own purposes, for example where we have a
query about a registration, but will not put it in the public
domain.
When we request information as part of the registration process,
we make it clear where the provision of information is required and
where it is voluntary.
Service providers reporting a breach
Job applicants, current and former aurora
employees
When individuals apply to work at aurora, we will only use the
information they supply to us to process their application and to
monitor recruitment statistics. Where we want to disclose
information to a third party, for example where we want to take up
a reference or obtain a
â€˜disclosureâ€™ from the
Criminal Records Bureau we will not do so without informing them
beforehand unless the disclosure is required by law.
Personal information about unsuccessful candidates will be held
for 12 months after the recruitment exercise has been completed, it
will then be destroyed or deleted. We retain de-personalised
statistical information about applicants to help inform our
recruitment activities, but no individuals are identifiable from
that data.
Once a person has taken up employment with aurora, we will
compile a file relating to their employment. The information
contained in this will be kept secure and will only be used for
purposes directly relevant to that personâ€™s
employment. Once their employment with Aurora has ended, we will
retain the file in accordance with the requirements of the Swedish
tax authorities.
Disclosure of personal information
In most circumstances we will not disclose personal data without
consent. However when we investigate a complaint, or in legal
conflicts arising out of non-payment for our data recovery
services, we will need to share personal information with our legal
advisors and with other relevant bodies.
