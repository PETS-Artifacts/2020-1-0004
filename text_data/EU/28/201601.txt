Privacy Policy
Why Customer Privacy matters to One.com
The customer’s right to privacy is of great importance to One.com. One.com recognizes that when a customer chooses to provide One.com with personal information, the customer places confidence in our ability to handle customer privacy in a responsible manner.
One.com believes this information should be used solely to improve the services provided for the customer. One.com has put this privacy policy together to state that we protect the customer’s personal information.
Personal Information Collected by One.com
When making a purchase at One.com, One.com will collect the customer’s contact information, which includes name, address, email address and phone number.
Protecting Customer Privacy
One.com will take appropriate steps to protect the customer’s privacy. Whenever the customer provides sensitive information (for example a credit card number to make a purchase), One.com will take all reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting the customer’s card number. One.com will also take reasonable security measures to protect the customer’s personal information in storage.
Occasionally One.com may disclose the customer’s name and address to third parties when required for delivering specific services and products requested by the customer. One.com will not provide any of the customer’s personal information to other companies or individuals for marketing purposes without the customer’s permission.
Personal Information Available for Update by the Customer
The customer can help One.com to improve the effectiveness and quality of service by keeping One.com notified of any changes to the customer’s name, address, phone number or email address. The customer can do this by updating the customer’s personal details when logged into the customer’s One.com control panel.
The personal information One.com collects and maintains will be subject to the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time of collection. One.com reserves the right to change the Privacy Policy from time to time and will provide notice of these changes in the news section at the One.com website. The customer should review the Privacy Policy periodically to make sure it meets the customer’s needs.
Privacy and Third Party Disclosure Regarding Domain Handling
As part of its obligations as a top level domain name registrar, One.com is required to provide certain information to naming authorities about customers who register domain names at One.com.
This information includes personal data such as the customer’s name, address and telephone number. The relevant naming authority may make such information available for the public through open, accessible directories of domain name owners.
As a condition for the purchase of a domain name at One.com the customer agrees in disclosure of his/her personal data to certain relevant domain name authorities. The customer understand and accepts that it is a condition of the purchase of a domain name from One.com that the customer agrees to the transfer of his/her personal data to the relevant naming authority and agrees to the naming authority making that personal data available on a public database.
Customer data policy
Customer Data
By Customer data is meant any information the customer has placed on his/her web space at One.com, for example emails, internet pages, photos and database content.
The Customer’s Data on the Account
Registration of a domain through One.com makes the customer the owner of the domain. The customer maintains all rights to the content that the customer places on his/her One.com web space. The templates and images placed at disposal by One.com, remains property of One.com. However, One.com does not claim any rights to the content that the customer has placed on the account. The account holder is on the other hand legally responsible for the content placed on the account.
One.com does not form any opinion or perform any legal review of the content on a customer’s web space account. However, in case of obvious illegal content for example child pornography, phishing attempts or the like, One.com will act as a responsible company and inform the relevant authorities. In all other cases One.com will take action if an EU or US court or another relevant authority orders One.com to do so.
The Customer’s Responsibility for the Account at One.com
The customer should always log out of any account when finishing a session, to ensure that others cannot access the customer’s private personal information. The customer should take this precaution even if the customer is not using a public computer at a library, an internet café or the like.
Data Security
One.com recognizes the special responsibility that comes with the hosting of personal data on customer’s web space accounts. We want our customers to consider One.com a trusted place for data storage. The One.com data center is therefore designed to meet the highest standards of security. All customer data and One.com’s system data are secured through a daily remote backup of all servers via a private 10 Gbit fibre connection to a separate backup data center located 10 km from the main data center.
The daily backup secures our customers’ web spaces against data loss. The backup includes all web spaces, regardless of type or size. Backup is a precaution against data loss caused by errors within One.com’s control. Consequently, unless the reason for the data loss is outside One.com’s control, we are able to recover all content after a potential failure. When restoring from a backup, the whole server and all web spaces on the server will be restored to their state prior to the failure.
Domain Expiration Policy
Generic Top Level domains and .uk / .co.uk / .me.uk / .org.uk domain names
One.com renews the registration of a domain name prior to its expiration, provided that the registrant of the domain complies with One.com’s terms of payment.
Domain expiration notification
Prior to the expiration of a gTLD, One.com notifies the registrant of the domain twice with instructions for renewing the domain name. The first notice is sent via email approximately one month prior to expiration. The second notice is sent via email approximately one week prior to expiration. 
Post-expiration notification
If a domain registration is not renewed by the registrant, then within five days after the expiration, One.com sends an additional expiration notice to the registrant of the domain with instructions for restoring the domain name.
Expiration notification content
One.com sends the notifications of expiration via email to the domain registrant in the language of the registration agreement. All relevant details regarding expiration date, domain renewal and recommended action, are clearly available by simply opening the notification email.
Redemption grace period
One.com offers a redemption grace period of 30 days after the expiration of a gTLD. During the redemption grace period, DNS is disabled for the domain and the domain cannot be transferred. One.com may restore the domain on request by the registrant of the domain during the redemption grace period. The fee to restore the domain is indicated in the One.com price list.
This Domain Expiration Policy sets out One.com’s Expired Registration Recovery Procedure (ERRP) for gTLDs as requested by ICANN and for .uk/.co.uk/.me.uk/.org.uk domain names. Different domain expiration policies may apply to other TLDs.
