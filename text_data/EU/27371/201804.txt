What are \'cookies\'?\n  \n\n\'Cookies\' are small text files that are stored by the browser (for example, Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari) on your computer or mobile phone. They allow websites to store things like user preferences. You can think of cookies as providing a \'memory\' for the website, so that it can recognise you when you come back and respond appropriately.\n  2.

Our servers use these cookies to work out which account you are signed in with, and load your birth profiles and celebrities favourites.\n    Anonymous analytics cookies: every time someone visits our website, software provided by another organisation generates an \'anonymous analytics cookie\'. These cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before. Your browser will tell us if you have these cookies and, if you don\'t, we generate new ones. This allows us to track how many individual users we have, and how often they visit the site. We use these cookies to gather statistics, for example, the number of visits to a page.\n    Third party cookies: on some pages of our website, other organisations may also set their own anonymous cookies. They do this to track the success of their application, or to customise the application for you.
