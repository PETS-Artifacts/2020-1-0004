 Website Visitors

       

      Like most website operators, PushEngage collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. PushEngage's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how PushEngage's visitors use its website. From time to time, PushEngage may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

       

      PushEngage also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on PushEngage's blogs. PushEngage only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

       

      Any personal information which is collected by PushEngage will be used by us only in accordance with current data protection legislation

       

      Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

       

      Certain visitors to PushEngage's websites choose to interact with PushEngage in ways that require PushEngage to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that PushEngage gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for PushEngage Marketing Automation at PushEngage.com or www.PushEngage.com to provide an email address. In each case, PushEngage collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with PushEngage. PushEngage does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

       

      Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

       

      PushEngage discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on PushEngage's behalf or to provide services available at PushEngage's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using PushEngage's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. PushEngage will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, PushEngage discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when PushEngage believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of PushEngage, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a PushEngage website and have supplied your email address, PushEngage may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with PushEngage and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. PushEngage takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
