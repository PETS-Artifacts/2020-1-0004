3. Information We Collect and How We Use It

    We do not collect information about the specifics of who you are ("Personally Identifiable Information") unless you specifically provide it to us.
  


Personal Information Entered by Users

        You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you register with us, send us email messages, submit forms to us, or provide information to us by any means. When you register, we will request some personal information which may include your name, address, email, telephone number or facsimile number, account number, and may include other relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and troubleshooting.
      

        You may also provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us regarding third parties. For instance, when you share your Animoto video with others, you provide and we collect the email addresses of the people with whom you want to share your video.
      

        You can log in to our site using Facebook Connect. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network.
      

        Our Web site offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at contact@animoto.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
      

        If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Animoto stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.
      

        Your friend may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.
      

        We will not sell, trade, or rent Personally Identifiable Information to others. Furthermore, we will not disclose Personally Identifiable Information we collect from you to third parties without your permission, except to the extent necessary:
      

To fulfill your service request,

To respond to a court order or subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings or similar legal process to comply with an investigation, or to comply with applicable laws or rules, or
In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.


        We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
      

        If Animoto Inc. is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.
      

        We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or site functionality.
  

    We use Local Storage such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
  

    We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.

5. Accessing Web Account Information

    We will provide you with the means to ensure that Personally Identifiable Information that we have on file for you is correct and current. You must update your Personally Identifiable Information promptly after it changes. You may review this information by sending us an email. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed at any time. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information; however, because we and our web hosting company have backup systems and keep track of past transactions and/or activities, it may be impossible to completely delete your information.
  

    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
  
6. User Communication

    We may, from time to time, send you email regarding our services. In addition, if you indicate upon registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from us, we may occasionally send you direct mail about products and services that may be of interest to you. Only Animoto will send you these direct mailings, and only if you indicated that you are interested in receiving these offers. If you do not want these mailings, you can tell us when you submit or edit your Personally Identifiable Information by sending us an email.
  
7. Security of Information

    We will keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure consistent with current industry standards. Security of your Personally Identifiable Information is of utmost concern to us. Personally Identifiable Information, once transmitted to us, will be stored on computers that only selected personnel and contractors have access to via password, and/or on web hosting servers maintained by Amazon Web Services, which employs its own physical and network security measures. In addition, your Animoto videos and/or content may be stored on Amazon Web Services servers. A copy of Amazon Web Services' Privacy Policy may be obtained here.
  

    Your Animoto videos and user content are limited-access, where access is gained through an obscured URL system. This obscured URL makes it difficult if not impossible for a third party to guess the URL address of your video or content without an invitation from you including the relevant URL. However, because the videos and content are not password-protected, a possibility exists that an unauthorized third party could discover your videos and/or content. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  
8. Changes to this Statement

    Animoto has the discretion to update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
