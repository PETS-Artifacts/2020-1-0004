 +Who are we? Premier Lotteries Ireland DAC (PLI) is the operator of the Irish National Lottery. PLI was awarded a 20-year licence to operate the National Lottery by the Irish Government in February 2014 and commenced operations in November 2014.
PLI uses Camelot Global Services Limited (CGS), a sister company, to manage our digital channels, customer services and IT requirements.
PLI and CGS are based in the same premises at National Lottery, Abbey Street Lower, Dublin 1. About this statement PLI is the controller of personal data collected and processed from visitors and players using the National Lottery’s website and apps.
This Data Privacy Statement is designed to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to inform you of the personal data that we collect and process in connection with your use of the National Lottery website and apps.
It also sets out details of what personal data we process, why we process it, with whom your personal data is shared, and a description of your rights with respect to your personal data.
This Data Privacy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take into account changes in the law and the experience of the Data Privacy Statement in practice. What personal data do we process? To comply with our obligations under the National Lottery Act 2013, which includes an obligation to prevent underage or problem play, we will collect and process information about you referred to in this Data Privacy Statement as ‘personal data’.
This personal data will include your account registration details and your on-site activity including transactional details. If you become a player and you later close your account, we are required by our licence to maintain a record of your account so we can meet our legal and regulatory obligations.
Your personal data is primarily obtained directly from you at the point of player registration or while you browse the website and when you play.
The categories of personal data we process, and the lawful bases for doing so, are set out in detail at the end of this Data Privacy Statement. How do we use your personal data? The personal data we hold, process and retain will be used for the management of your account, for administrative purposes, for meeting our legal and regulatory obligations and for marketing. We hold it and use it to protect your rights and interests and to manage our relationship with you appropriately, effectively and lawfully. At the same time, it enables us to run our business.
This includes using your personal data to enable us to manage your registration, comply with our legal obligations, pursue our legitimate interests and protect ourselves in the event of legal proceedings.
The uses we make of each category of your personal data, together with the lawful bases we rely on for those uses are set out in more detail at the end of this Data Privacy Statement.
Where there is a need to process your data for a purpose other than those set out at the end of this Data Privacy Statement, or otherwise outlined to you, we will inform you of this and, if required, we will seek your consent.
If you do not wish to open an online account, but wish to participate in retail promotions which require you to enter limited personal data online, this data will be treated in the same manner as set out in this Data Privacy Statement.
If you do not wish to share the personal data required during the registration process, unfortunately you will not be able to use the online services to play National Lottery games. How is your personal data shared? Your personal data may be disclosed to third parties where we are legally obliged to do so.
It will also be disclosed during activities where we have lawful contractual agreements in place that enable us to operate the National Lottery.
Your data will also be disclosed to third parties where we have a lawful legitimate interest to share your data, such as in marketing campaigns, provided that you have agreed to receive marketing information.
Again, you will find more detailed information on how we share your personal data with third parties, and who they are, at the end of this Data Privacy Statement. Will your personal data be transferred abroad? The main storage location for your personal data is in Ireland.

Your personal data will be transferred outside of the EEA during the provision of certain services which are managed and provided by third parties. Recognised data protection safeguards are in place to ensure the security of your personal data where it is transferred outside of the EEA.
Further details are provided at the end of this Data Privacy Statement. How long do we keep your personal data? Any personal data that we collect, process and hold about you is retained only for as long as it is required.
However, under the licence to operate the National Lottery, PLI is required to keep certain records, such as financial transactions and the personal data associated with that, for a period of two years after the end of the licence agreement.
