Behavioral Advertising
Subject to your consent where required by law, we, and  certain third parties operating on  or through our Digital Services, may engage in online behavioral advertising. This  form of advertising includes various parties and service providers, including  third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of Personal Data in  connection with advertising.  This form  of advertising uses Preferences Data, Device Data, Identity Data, and at times, Contact  Data in order to deliver more relevant advertising to you. The parties that  control the processing of Personal Data for behavioral advertising purposes may  build a profile of you containing this information, and may be able to identify  you across sites, devices, and over time. These services may also track whether  you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether or not  you complete a purchase for goods or services you were shown in an  advertisement. These tracking technologies may also be used to help limit the  number of times you see the same ads, or help determine whether you have  interacted with or viewed ads delivered to you.
Processing of this data takes place on our Digital Services,  on third-party websites that participate in ad networks, and through other  services providers. Third party companies, for example social media companies,  may also collect this information via third-party social media cookies, or when  you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on  our Digital Services or you link your account or engage with our content on or  through a social networking website such as Facebook or Twitter.
In some cases, the third parties described above may also  develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are  a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how  ads you see are effective, and may augment your profile with information  derived from observations about you on other websites.	
See Your Rights and  Choices for information about how you can limit or opt out of this  processing.
Personalization
Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we may  personalize our Digital Services. To do so, we may link together and analyze  the Personal Data that we hold about you, which may be augmented with  Preferences Data. We may create Preferences Data, or obtain it from third parties, using Personal Data we  hold about you. We process Preferences Data so that our communications and  Digital Services are more relevant to you.
