By accessing files, browsing, or otherwise using the Pivotal Websites, you agree to comply with both this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use posted at https://pivotal.io/legal, as may be updated by Pivotal from time to time (“Terms of Use”), which are incorporated herein by reference.

Unless otherwise specified below, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any other products or services or to information collected in any other way (whether online or offline) or for any other purpose.




Personal Information of our Customers’ Clients


Pivotal collects information under the direction of our customers, and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. When we provide services to our customers, in some instances we process personal information about their clients (“Client Information”) on their behalf. In these situations, it is our customers rather than we who decide the reasons for which the Client Information will be processed.


If you are a Client of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service or for details of how the Client Information will be used and protected, and details of how to access or correct the information, please refer to the privacy statement of the Pivotal customer to which you submitted your personal information. If you are a Client of one of our customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our customers that use our service, please contact the customer or the company that you interact with directly. We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our customers.


Pivotal acknowledges that you have the right to access your personal information. Pivotal has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his query to Pivotal’s Client (the data controller). If requested to remove data we will respond within a reasonable timeframe.


We will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services to our Client. Pivotal will retain this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Marketing Choices, Right to Access Your Personal Information, and Our Retention


Your Marketing Choices. Your decision to provide the personal information that we may request from time to time is voluntary. However, if you do not provide the personal information requested, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested. You can always unsubscribe or choose not to receive promotional materials from Pivotal by following the specific instructions in the email or other communication you receive or by notifying us via the appropriate method(s) described below. It may take a reasonable period of time to process your request, but no longer than 10 business days for email promotions. In countries where Pivotal is required to do so by law, Pivotal will offer you the opportunity to provide opt-in consent before promotional materials are sent, or promotional calls are made, to you. This will not apply to service communications that are considered part of certain Services, which you may receive periodically unless you cancel the applicable Service.


Your Access to Your Personal Information. Pivotal strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes, and policies to maintain data integrity. We will provide you with reasonable access to your personal information in accordance with relevant laws, including by making reasonable efforts to provide you with online access and the opportunity to update your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information. Upon request, Pivotal will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. To request access, correction, or deletion of your personal information, follow the applicable instructions below. While we will make reasonable efforts to accommodate your request, we also reserve the right to reject such access requests or to impose certain restrictions and requirements on such requests, if required or permitted by applicable law. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time frame.


Our Retention of Your Information. We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Products or Services. If you wish to cancel your account, or request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you Products or Services, contact us via the applicable methods provided below. Even after we cancel your account or cease using your personal information to provide you Products or Services, we may still retain, use, and disclose your information as necessary to comply with our legal, regulatory, ethical, or document retention obligations, and any request to delete your personal information is subject to these obligations and restrictions.




Security of Your Personal Information


Pivotal has implemented administrative, technical, and physical measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, disclosure, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include computer safeguards and secured files and buildings, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus protection, network monitoring, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Transport Layer Security (“TLS”) or similarly encrypted browsers. However, no electronic data transmission or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% private and secure, and you understand that Pivotal does not ensure or warrant the privacy or security of any information we collect from or about you, and that you use the Pivotal Websites and provide us with information at your own risk. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Please also be careful to avoid “phishing” scams, where someone may send you an email that looks like it is from Pivotal asking for your personal information. Pivotal will never request your personal information through e-mail. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at set forth below.
