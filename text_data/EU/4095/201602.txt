Last Updated: Aug 7, 2015

At Mindspark, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us. This Privacy Policy describes the  practices concerning the information collected by the Mindspark family of companies consisting of Mindspark Interactive  Network, Inc. and IAC Search and Media Europe Limited  (“Mindspark”, "we", "us" and "our") through the use of the (i) websites and applications, e.g. tool bars, content, products, forums and services controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc.  (the “MS Products”) and (ii) our "Search Applications" made available by means of a search box on a MS Product or website from which you can access our search services. These Search Applications are controlled by Mindspark Interactive Network, Inc. for users in the United States and Asia Pacific region and by our Irish affiliate, IAC Search and Media Europe Limited, for users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific region. Collectively, we refer to the MS Products and these Search Applications in this Privacy Policy as the “MS Services”.
Mindspark respects the privacy of users of the MS Services, and has developed this privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is a user of the MS Services, the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures. 
We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the MS Services, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you have any questions about our privacy practices, please refer to the end of this Privacy Policy for information on how to contact us. Certain MS Services may be subject to different privacy policies and/or terms of service as indicated on the sites from where those services are available and/ or accessed.  
A. Search services
The Search Applications provide features to facilitate Internet search and communication services using the MS Products including through the MyWay and MyWebSearch portals and email. This search functionality may be implemented through browser settings and “extensions” that set or default your browser homepage, start page, new tab page and/or default search setting(s), depending on which MS Product you are using and what options you select. If you do not wish to reset your setting(s) in this way, you can decline or opt-out of the setting(s) change by unchecking the appropriate checkbox during the download and installation process for the relevant MS Product that provides access to the Search Applications. Certain MS Products, such as Chrome new tab products, may be available through the online store operated by the browser developer (e.g., the Chrome web store) and the user disclosures and options may vary based on the store’s requirements. The search features, as well as other non-search-related features, may be customized by you. In addition, you can disable or remove the default search features by removing or disabling the applicable files you downloaded from the MS Products, or changing your default search within your browser, depending on your browser, browser version, and tools and features provided in your respective browser. Click here to go to our support page In some MS Products the Search Applications are provided by Ask under the Ask brand in which case the relevant Ask Privacy Policy applies. This is available here for European residents and users outside of the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, and here for users in the United States and the Asia Pacific Region.B.
