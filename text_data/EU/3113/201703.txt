Privacy Policy:
AdsWizz Inc. (“AdsWizz,” “we”, or “us”) is an audio and video ad serving tech company. We enable online radio and video publishers and advertisers to get to know their audience by providing precise session-based measurements. Our customers use our solutions to deliver relevant online advertisements into their streams.
 
The following sets forth the privacy practices and policy (“Privacy Policy”) related to the business we operate. It covers all data on website visitors/listeners that we collect for the purpose of delivering and enhancing our services. We are committed to protecting consumer privacy by informing you of what information we collect, how we use it, and with whom we may share it. We adhere to the Privacy Principles adopted by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB).

 
What information do we collect to perform our services?
We collect or receive data from our customers (publishers/advertisers) in order to learn about the ads you might be interested in. This data includes but is not limited to browser identifier, wireless carrier, IP address, device type (website player, smartphone apps, media player, etc.) and browsing information. We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, type of mobile browser, software and file names, versions, preferred language, advertising identifiers, device motion and accelerometer information, real-time location (based on information provided by your device OS), and mobile network information.
 
We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the website(s) and application(s) that we support. The collection and use of that data is governed by the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not governed by AdsWizz.
 
We also measure the exposure to online advertising campaign: number of impressions, number of clicks, numbers of users exposed, percentage of ad content played. We retain information on the ads that we served to you on a website and we reuse that information to deliver new ads when you visit another website on which we may also serve ads. We collect information such as your reaction to the ad (skip the ad, click on the ad) for statistical reporting purposes or to limit serving you additional ads.
 
Furthermore, we collect and use only non-PII that does not directly or in combination with other information identify you as an individual. We may also obtain non-PII from third party data vendors that receive such non-PII pursuant to their own privacy policies. We do not collect PII via our advertising technology. None of the information we collect to provide our services is meant to be traced back to a specific individual.
