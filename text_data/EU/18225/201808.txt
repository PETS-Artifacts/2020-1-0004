About affiliaXe


					As an affiliate network, affiliaXe provides services via the Internet to both Publishers and Advertisers. The Website acts as an intermediary agent between a person, entity, affiliate or its agent ("Publisher") and an "Advertiser" (another person, company, or entity).
					
					A Publisher is operating Website(s) (internet domain, or a portion of a domain), and other promotional methods to drive traffic to another Website or Website content. The Publisher may earn financial compensation ("Payouts") for "Transactions" (actions made by Visitors as defined by the Advertiser). The "Visitor" (any person or entity that is not the Publisher, the Publisher's agent, or the advertiser) is making an action (registration, purchase, signup, etc.) which is referred to the Publisher through an Internet connection ("Link") to a Website operated by the Advertiser. The Advertiser compensates the Publisher on actions, by this Agreement and the Program Payout specifications.
