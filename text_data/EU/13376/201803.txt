How We Will Use Your Personal Data
All personal data that we obtain about you will be recorded, used, and protected by us in accordance with current data protection law and this Privacy Policy. We will primarily use the personal data for the following purposes:

administration. To provide the goods and services you request and to communicate with you in the event that any of them are unavailable or if there is a query or problem with your request
market research. To carry out market research so that we can improve the goods and services we offer
profiling. To create an individual profile for you (such as your AZoProfile) which includes analysing demographic and geographic information so that we can enhance your experience and relationship with us, understand and respect your preferences and to provide information and details of other initiatives where you have agreed to receive them 

Consent and lawful processing of personal data
The legal basis for the collection and use of your personal data is that you have given your consent and/or that it is in our legitimate interests to do so in order to educate and encourage innovation in science and your rights and freedoms are not prejudiced by this.
Disclosing your personal data
We do not sell personal data but we will, however, share your data with those of our suppliers from which you require a quotation, content updates and/or details of related products and services if you have agreed to us doing so. Our Supplier Directory  sets out details of our suppliers including where they are in the world. We update the Supplier Directory regularly and you can see the most up-to-date version on each of our websites.
To operate our websites and to provide our products and services, we may, occasionally, appoint other organisations to carry out some of the processing activities on our behalf. These may include, for example, technology hosts and email distribution services. In these circumstances, we will ensure that your personal data is properly protected and that it is only used in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
Publication on our websites
Where a supplier, contributor or expert provides contact details, qualifications or employment information to us, we may publish this on our websites and/or in our Supplier Directory .
Sale or other disposal of our business
If, for any reason, we dispose of any part of our business, we may transfer any records (which may include your personal data) to the new owner.
Invitations, Newsletters and Opportunities
AZoNetwork and our suppliers would each like to contact you by email about products, services and a range of other initiatives. Details of how to opt-in to or opt-out of receiving information are on relevant pages of this Website and/or in the electronic message you receive.
We will usually try to tailor the communications we send to you so that they are relevant and in line with the preference options you have chosen which form part of the personal profile we will create for you.
Preferences / Subscribe / Unsubscribe
You can change your mind about whether you wish to receive information at any time and can tell us of your preferences by emailing us at [email protected] or by following the instructions with each communication you receive.
Please note it may take up to one month for your changes to be implemented and for communications to cease.
Data Security
We take the security of personal data seriously. We employ security technology, including firewalls, and encryption to safeguard personal data and have procedures in place to ensure that our systems and databases are protected against unauthorised disclosure, use, loss and damage.
We only use third party service providers where we are satisfied that the security they provide for your personal data is at least as stringent as we use ourselves.
Data Retention
We will normally keep your personal data for five years after your last interaction with us, or any of our websites. If we consider that you are no longer an active user of our websites or our services we may delete your personal data sooner than this.
We expect to contact you at least every two years to ensure you are still happy to hear from us according to the preferences you have provided to us.
Transfer of Your Personal Data Outside of Europe
To provide our services to you, we transfer personal data to our trusted service provider in the United States. We have taken proper steps to ensure that it is protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable privacy laws.
Some of our suppliers are located in regions outside of Europe (our Supplier Directory  shows the world region for each supplier). If you agree to us providing your details to our suppliers, your data may be transferred to the relevant supplier to satisfy your requirements.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
Privacy laws and practice are constantly developing and we aim to meet high standards. Our policies and procedures are, therefore, under continual review. We may, from time to time, update our security and privacy policies. If we want to make any significant changes in how we will use your personal data we will contact you directly and, if required, seek your consent.
We will ensure our Website has our most up to date policy and suggest that you check this page periodically to review our latest version.
Updating and Correcting Personal Data
You may update or correct your personal data by logging into your AZoProfile Page or contacting us and asking us to do it for you (see the section ‘How to contact us’ below). Please include your name and/or email address when you contact us as this helps us to ensure that we accept amendments only from the correct person.
On your AZoProfile page you can manage your data and conduct any of the following actions;

We encourage you to promptly update your personal data if it changes. If you are providing updates or corrections about another person, we may require you to provide us with proof that you are authorised to provide that information to us.
Your Rights
You have a number of legal rights in respect of your personal data. These include:

access. The right to receive a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. We will require proof of identity and proof of authority if the request comes from someone other than the person whose data we are asked to provide. This will ensure we only provide information to the correct person. We normally expect to respond to requests within 28 days of receiving them.
withdraw consent to direct marketing. You can exercise this right at any time and can update your preferences yourself or ask us to do it for you. See section ‘Updating and correcting your personal data’ above for details. 
withdraw consent to other processing. Where the only legal basis for our processing your personal data is that we have your consent to do so, you may withdraw your consent to that processing at any time and we will have to stop processing your personal data. Please note, this will only affect a new activity and does not mean that processing carried out before you withdrew your consent is unlawful.
rectification. If you consider any of your personal data is inaccurate, you can correct it yourself or ask us to do it for you (see section ‘Updating and correcting your personal data’ above for details).
restriction. In limited circumstances you may be able to require us to restrict our processing of your personal data. For example, if you consider what we hold is inaccurate and we disagree, the processing may be restricted until the accuracy has been verified.
erasure. Where we have no lawful basis for holding onto your personal data you may ask us to delete it.
portability. In limited circumstances you may be entitled to have the personal data you have provided to us sent electronically to you for you to provide to another organisation. 
to complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office. If you have a concern or complaint we would prefer you to contact us (see the section ‘How to contact us’ below) and we will try to resolve it for you. If you want to make a complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office, you can find information on how to do this at ico.org.uk.
