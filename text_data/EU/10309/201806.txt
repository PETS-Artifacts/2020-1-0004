YOUR RIGHTS TO YOUR INFORMATION
Managing Your Information. You may access and update some of your information through your Account settings. If you have chosen to connect your CreativeLive Account to a third-party application, (e.g. Facebook), you may modify permissions by changing your Account settings in the app.
Portability. Some jurisdictions may entitle you to obtain a copy of your personal information kept by us. You may also be entitled to request from us a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format.
Data Retention and Deletion. Except for under specific circumstances, we retain your personal information for only as long as it is necessary for you and us to perform our respective obligations and comply with our legal obligations. If you no longer want us to provide CreativeLive services to you, you may request that we delete your personal information and close your CreativeLive Account. If you request the deletion of your personal information: (a) your information will be deleted from our databases; (b) we may retain some of your personal information as necessary to improve safety and legal compliance such as fraud detection and prevention and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend a CreativeLive Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that CreativeLive Account to prevent that Member from opening a new CreativeLive Account in the future; (c) we may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with the law. For example, CreativeLive may keep some of your information for tax, legal and auditing obligations; (d) information you have shared with others (e.g., comments made during the class or on the class page) may continue to be publicly visible on CreativeLive, even after your CreativeLive Account is removed. 
Withdrawing Consent to Data Processing. Where you have provided your consent to the processing of your personal information by CreativeLive you may withdraw your consent at any time by changing your Account settings or by emailing CreativeLive specifically identifying the consent being withdrawn.
