International Transfers of Data
It may in certain circumstances be illegal to transfer any personal data outside of the EEA. However, when using the internet to collect and transfer data, the exact path of data transmission is unknown and could therefore be transferred outside of this area.
Disclosure to third parties
From time to time we disclose data to third parties(these include but are not limited to our Licensing Bodies, Sporting Integrity Bodies, Security Verification Companies and Marketing Companies)for the purposes of direct mailing, emailing, database management and card processing and security checking or investigation on our behalf or for compliance with lawful requests. Where this is purely for statistical use/analysis this disclosure does not include personal data. Other information is disclosed only to the extent required to enable the necessary functions to be undertaken. We remain responsible for the actions of third parties to whom we disclose data. For a full list of third parties we may disclose your information to please contact help@betvictor.com.
To ensure that your credit, debit or charge card is not being used without your consent, we will validate name, address and other personal information supplied by you against appropriate third party databases. In performing these checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information.  This is done to confirm your identity, a credit check is not performed and your credit rating will be unaffected
The security and accuracy of your data
All of the data collected is stored in a secure and protected environment and is correct as it is provided. You are entitled by law to have a copy of the data recorded (subject to a £10 administration charge) and to have any errors corrected. All reasonable steps will be taken to ensure that any processing of your data will adhere to the strictest standards of security and accuracy.
