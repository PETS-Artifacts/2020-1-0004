We may use third parties who collect Information about Site Visitors through their own cookies, web beacons, and other technologies regarding your online activities, either on our Sites and/or other websites across the Internet, in an effort to understand your interests and deliver you advertisements that are tailored to your interests.  These third parties include advertisers and ad networks that may collect information about when you view or interact with one of their advertisements and may collect information regarding your activities on our Sites and your online activities over time and across different Websites. Like most advertisers, we place advertisements where we think they will be most relevant to the recipient. One way we do so is by allowing the advertising networks with whom we work to place their own cookies when an individual visits our Sites. This enables the network advertising company to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Sites. When the individual visits a third-party website on which that network advertising company has purchased ad space, the advertising company can then recognize the individual's interest in Taboola and deliver one of our advertisements. To learn more about third parties who collect Site Visitor Information, please review our Cookie Policy.

Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit the DAA consumer choice page, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info. Taboola is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Program for Interest Based Advertising.
