Cookies serve to save information related to the device on the\r\nterminal and thus increase the usability, for instance by allowing websites and\r\ngames to recognize the user upon their next visit. Apart from that, they serve\r\nto save statistical data pertaining to the usage of these websites and games,\r\nand analyze them to ameliorate the content. A cookie contains, among other\r\ndata, the domain name the cookie is from, the "operating time" of this\r\ncookie and a value, generally a specific number that has been created randomly.\r\nNaturally, you\x92ll be able to influence the usage of cookies, by setting your\r\nbrowser to only admit cookies partially, or to entirely decline them.

Certain information such\r\nas communication between users may also be visible to other users of upjers\x92 websites and games.\r\n\r\nIn order to sign up for the use of games\r\noperated by upjers, you generally need to identify\r\nyourself by entering your email-address. If you want to make use of additional\r\noffers inside the games, upjers may need further\r\ninformation, such as for instance your bank details.\r\n\r\nHere are a few examples of the data that upjers saves:\r\n\r\nIf you sign up on a game operated by upjers or use it, upjers\r\nautomatically saves the domain name and/or the IP address of the computer you\r\nuse to contact upjers.\r\n\r\nupjers saves your email address, if you have transmitted it to upjers. Information on which further data may be collected\r\nin occasional other cases, can be gathered by the respective input masks.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\xa7 2 Use of\r\nPersonal Data\r\n\r\na) upjers will only collect, process or pass on\r\nyour personal data if this is legally permitted, or if you have given your\r\nconsent. upjers only makes use of the data gathered\r\nby server log files for statistical processing for the purpose of operating\r\nthese websites and games, in order to ensure the security and optimization of\r\nthese websites and games. upjers reserves the right\r\nto subsequently control this data if, based on concrete evidence, there is\r\nlegitimate reason to suspect an unlawful usage of the websites and games.\r\n\r\nupjers uses data entered during the process of signing up for the purpose of\r\nusing the websites and games. upjers may send you\r\ninformation via email containing changes to the scope of service of the\r\nrespective websites and games or technical details.\r\n\r\nIn case of contacting upjers\r\n\x96 for instance via a contact form or email \x96 your data is being saved for the\r\npurpose of treating your request.

That means that upjers,\r\nfor instance, won\'t just be able to use the saved data to directly carry out\r\nthe user contract including all its possible forms of use (such as using the\r\ngames, participating in services connected to games, use of customer support),\r\nbut also to detect malfunctions or misuse of upjers\'\r\nwebsites and games.\r\n\r\nb) We are happy to inform you about our company as well as the games and\r\nservices provided by upjers via newsletter.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to receive our newsletter, upjers needs a valid email-address from you. Furthermore, upjers needs information that allows us to check whether\r\nyou are really the owner of the indicated email-address, or if the user of the\r\nemail-address has consented to receiving the newsletter (\x93verification\x94).

This only happens for the\r\npurpose of gathering proof, in case a third person has misused another person\x92s\r\nemail-address and signed up for the newsletter without the owner\x92s knowledge. upjers gathers no further data.

If you want upjers\r\nto change your personal data or stop using your personal data, you may contact upjers via datenschutzbeauftragter@upjers.com.\r\nupjers will then change or delete your data as\r\nquickly as possible. upjers informs you, however,\r\nthat, due to technical or organizational conditions it might be possible that\r\nsome measures will still need to be carried out even after the demand of\r\ndeletion, should these already have begun but haven\'t been completed after you\r\nhave informed upjers of your wish to be deleted.\r\nFurthermore, it might be possible that we may only be able to entirely delete\r\nyour data at a later date, in case of existing mandatory data retention\r\nobligations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\xa7 4 Separate Notes\r\n\r\n1. Use of the Scalabe Central Measurement\r\nMethod \r\n\r\nupjers\r\nuses the "Scalable Central Measurement Method / Skalierbares\r\nZentrales Messverfahren"\r\n(SZM) by INFOnline for several of its offers to\r\ndetermine statistical parameters in the scope of upjers\'\r\nservices. In doing so, anonymous measures are collected. For the recognition of\r\ncomputer systems, the SZM audience measurement uses alternatively either a\r\ncookie with the identifier "ivwbox.de" or a signature which is\r\ncreated from various information that is automatically transferred by your\r\ncomputer. IP addresses are not stored via this method and only processed in anonymized form. \r\n\r\nThe audience measurement was developed in\r\nconsideration of data protection. The goal of the audience measurement is to\r\nstatistically determine user intensity and the number of users of a specific\r\nwebsite. Individual users are not identified at any point in time. Their\r\nidentity is always protected. They will not receive any advertizing via the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nFor websites which are\r\nmembers of the IVW German Audit Bureau of Circulation (Informationsgemeinschaft\r\nzur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbetr\xe4gern e.V., www.ivw.eu) or\r\nthat participate in the study "Internet Facts", organized by the Work\r\nGroup Online Research (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V., AGOF), user\r\nstatistics are published monthly by the AGOF and the AGMA (Arbeitsgemeinschaft\r\nMedia-Analyse e.V., ag.ma),\r\nas well as the IVW and can be viewed at http://www.agof.de,\r\nhttp://www.agma-mmc.de and http://www.ivw.eu.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the\r\npublication of measurement data, the IVW also regularly checks the SZM process\r\nto ensure that it is used in accordance with regulations and data protection. \r\n\r\nYou can find\r\nadditional information about the SZM process on the website of INFOonline GmbH (https://www.infonline.de), the operators\r\nof the SZM process, as well as the data protection website of AGOF\r\n(http://www.agof.de/datenschutz) and the data protection website of IVW\r\n(http://www.ivw.eu). \r\n\r\nYou\r\ncan object to the data processing by the SZM under the following link: http://optout.ivwbox.de.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2. Use of Google Analytics\r\n\r\nIn the scope of its offers, upjers\r\nmakes use of Google Analytics, an analytics service provided by Google, Inc.,\r\n1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (subsequently referred\r\nto as \x93Google\x94).

By order of upjers, Google will use this information for the purpose of\r\nevaluating your use of the websites, compiling reports on website activity, and\r\nproviding other services relating to your website activity and internet usage.\r\nThe IP-address your browser transmits in the frame of Google Analytics will not\r\nbe associated with any other data held by Google.

Usage of GoogleAdSense\r\n\r\nInsofar\r\nas advertisements are being displayed on our websites by Google Adsense, an advertisement service by Google (banners, text\r\nads), your browser may be saving cookies sent by Google. Furthermore, Google Adsense makes use of so-called \x93WebBacons\x94\r\n(invisible graphics) to gather information, whose usage permits the saving,\r\ngathering, and processing of simple actions such as the user traffic on the\r\nrespective website. upjers has no influence on this\r\ndata collection. We however assume that at least the visit of the site as well\r\nas the user\x92s device code are being recorded. The information gathered by\r\ncookies or web bacons about the visit of the respective website (including your\r\nIP-address) and the transmission of advertisements will be transmitted to a\r\nGoogle server in the USA and saved there. Google will hereafter solely use the\r\ngathered information, to offer you selected advertisements designed to meet unique\r\nrequirements that should, as much as possible, also be in keeping with your own\r\nindividual interests. Google may also transfer this information to third\r\nparties especially where required to do so by law, or where such third parties\r\nprocess the information on Google\'s behalf. Google will not associate your IP\r\naddress with any other data held by Google.\r\n\r\nFor\r\nfurther details on the collecting and usage of this data, as well as your\r\nrespective rights pertaining to the protection of your privacy, please consult\r\nGoogle\x92s privacy policy under the following link: http://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/\r\n\r\nYou can prevent the storage of cookies on your hard\r\ndrive. To do this, you need to select the corresponding setting in your\r\nbrowser-settings, such as \x93Block sites from setting any data\x94; however upjers informs you that you may not be able to use all\r\nfunctions of this offer to their full extent in this case. By using this\r\nwebsite you are consenting to the processing of the data gathered about you by\r\nGoogle in the aforementioned means, and to the aforementioned purpose.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n4. Usage of Social Media Plug-ins\r\n\r\nupjers offers its users the following social media plug-ins in the scope of its\r\ninternet offers:\r\n\r\n- \xa0\xa0 Facebook "Like"-button of the social network Facebook, operated by Facebook\r\nInc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA;\r\n\r\n- \xa0\xa0 Google "+1"-button of the social network Google+,\r\noperated by Google Inc., 1600\r\nAmphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA;\r\n\r\n- \xa0\xa0 Twitter\r\n"Tweet" of the communication platform Twitter, operated by Twitter Inc., 795\r\nFolsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA.\r\n\r\nThe plug-ins are developed and provided\r\nby the respective operators, and integrated into our websites unchanged. By\r\nusing the respective buttons, users are able to recommend the respectively\r\nvisited website. That way, you can recommend offers by upjers\r\nto your friends in Facebook, other users of Google\r\nPlus, as well as followers on Twitter. If you, for instance, click the\r\n\x93Like\x94-button, your Facebook-page will display the\r\nmessage that you recommend our service. If you use\r\nthe \x93+1\x94-button by Google Plus, your recommendation will appear on your Google\r\nPlus-profile, or the search results of the search engine \x93Google\x94. Furthermore,\r\nyour recommendation may be displayed on websites and ads of third persons in\r\nconnection to your profile name and profile picture. Using the Twitter button,\r\nyou\x92ll be able to share an entry or page of upjers\x92\r\noffers on Twitter. Aside from the aforementioned functions, these buttons allow\r\nan automatized communication between websites and the\r\nrespective platform.\r\n\r\nOnce you activate the plug-in of another platform, your browser builds a direct connection to their\r\nservers in the USA, and will afterwards communicate with the respective\r\nservice. The content of the plug-in will be loaded directly into your browser\r\nby the servers, and integrated into our website by them.\r\n\r\nWe therefore have no influence on\r\nthe amount of the data the platform operators are collecting by means of these\r\nbuttons, and inform you according to our knowledge: we assume that the visit of\r\nthis website, the confirmation of the button and the IP-address are being\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the implementation\r\nof the social plug-ins is allowing Facebook to gather\r\nthe information that you have called the respective website of upjers\x92 offer. If you are logged into Facebook\r\nduring that time, Facebook will be able to connect\r\nyour visit to your Facebook-account. By interacting\r\nwith social plug-ins, for instance by clicking the \x93Like\x94-button, the\r\nrespective information is being transmitted by your browser directly to Facebook, and saved there. If you are not a member of Facebook, it is still possible that your IP-address may be\r\nsaved, however, according to Facebook, in Germany,\r\nonly an anonymized IP-address is being saved. If you\r\nare a member of Facebook, and don\x92t want Facebook to gather data via upjers\x92\r\noffer and link them to your user data saved on Facebook,\r\nyou need to logout of Facebook before visiting the\r\nwebsites containing upjers\x92 offer.\r\n\r\nAccording to Google, no personal\r\ndata is being collected, if you don\x92t click the \x93+1\x94-button. Accordingly,\r\npersonal data is only being collected and processed from members that are\r\nlogged in, among others the IP-address.\r\n\r\nAs far as we are aware, when\r\nclicking the Twitter-buttons, only your IP-address and the URL of the\r\nrespective website upjers\x92 offer is on, will be\r\ntransmitted, and not used for any other purposes other than the display of the\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nIn case you have a user profile\r\non a platform, you should be aware that the platform\x92s operator is able to link\r\ninformation to your user account as soon as you activate the respective\r\nplug-in. If you don\x92t agree to this, you should log out of your user profile,\r\nbefore activating a plug-in.\r\n\r\nFor further information regarding\r\nthe purpose and the amount of data that is being collected, the further use of\r\nyour data by the platform operators, as well as your respective rights and\r\nprivacy protection settings, please refer to the data privacy statements under\r\nthe following links:\r\n\r\nFacebook:\xa0\xa0\xa0 https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/\r\n\r\nGoogle+:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 http://www.google.com/intl/de/+/policy/+1button.html\r\n\r\nTwitter:\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 https://twitter.com/privacy\r\n\r\nWe would like to inform you\r\nthat you are able to block social media plug-ins using the assistance of\r\nadd-ons such as Facebook blocker.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n5. Data usage in integrated games\r\n\r\nSome upjers games are integrated to platforms of\r\nsocial networks (especially Facebook). There, these\r\ngames are referred to as so-called \x93apps\x94 or \x93applications\x94. If you wish to use\r\nthese games, you are being prompted to allow the collecting/saving of, for\r\ninstance, the following data by upjers:\r\n\r\n-    \r\nFirst and last name, gender,\r\ndate of birth\r\n\r\n-    \r\nProfile picture or respective\r\nURL\r\n\r\n-    \r\nLogin email-address used for\r\nsigning up on Facebook\r\n\r\n-    \r\nLocation and access devices\r\n\r\n-    \r\nUser ID number, which is linked to publically available information (on Facebook)\r\n\r\n-    \r\nUser\r\nID number to your friends that are also connected to the game\r\n\r\nBy confirming the button \x93Allow\x93, you consent to the collecting, saving and processing\r\nof your data.\r\n\r\nupjers informs you that the amount of information upjers\r\nreceives from Facebook can be influenced by\r\nrespective privacy-settings. You may be able to especially exert your influence\r\nby:\r\n\r\n-    \r\ncontrolling which information\r\nyou share with/about your Facebook-friends,\r\n\r\n-    \r\nblocking special applications\r\nor stopping them from collecting specific information about you,\r\n\r\n-    \r\nignoring specific\r\ngame-invitations,\r\n\r\n-    \r\ncontrolling, who is able to\r\nview your activities.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n6. Play immediately/now mode\r\n\r\nIn case upjers offers\r\nthe possibility to use one or another game without the usual registration\r\nprocess, you receive a guest account. By using such a temporary guest account,\r\nthe utilization of additional services for valuable consideration is not\r\npossible. You will not be prompted to depose personal data (such as your email\r\naddress). Instead, you are granted access to the game by using a guest name and\r\na corresponding password.\r\n\r\nThe guest name created in the scope of the guest account (that you will be informed\r\nof in the game) will automatically be deleted after a certain period of time\r\nfollowing your registration. You may, however register for the game. The\r\npersonal data obtained in the scope of the registration are then dealt with as\r\nis indicated in this data privacy statement.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\xa7 5\r\nDisclosure of personal data\r\n\r\nUpon request, upjers will inform you about all\r\ndata stored about you without costs. This information will always be\r\ntransmitted in electronic form, generally via email.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\xa7 6\r\nThird-Party Websites / Links\r\n\r\nIn case you are forwarded to\r\nanother website that is not operated by upjers, via a\r\nlink contained on one of the websites and games operated by upjers,\r\nupjers informs you that this data privacy statement\r\nis not valid for third-party websites. upjers cannot\r\nbe made liable for how the providers of third-party websites handle your data.\r\nIn particular, upjers cannot be made liable if such\r\nwebsites do not follow the same data privacy standards upjers\r\noffers you. upjers therefore recommends that you\r\nalways carefully read the data privacy statements of linked sites.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\xa7 7 Changes\r\nof Data Privacy Statement\r\n\r\nupjers reserves the right to change this data privacy statement at any time,\r\nhowever, upjers will always adhere to the currently\r\napplicable data security laws. upjers advises you to\r\ninform yourself on each visit to these websites and games about the current\r\ndata privacy statement. In case upjers plans on using\r\nyour personal data on a larger scale than has previously been the case, upjers will of course notify your beforehand.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nValid as of September 2013\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nProvider of services:\r\n\r\nupjers GmbH\r\n\r\nCEO: Klaus Schmitt\r\n\r\nAddress: Hafenstrasse 13, 96052 Bamberg, Germany\r\n\r\nEmail: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 mail@upjers.com (no\r\nsupport)\r\n\r\nTelephone: \xa0 +49-951/5109080 (no\r\nsupport)\r\n\r\nFax: \xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 +49-951/510908102\r\n(no support)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegistration\r\ncourt: Local Court of Bamberg\r\n\r\nCompany registration\r\nnumber: HRB 5558\r\n\r\nVAT number:\xa0 DE275673923\r\n\r\nData protection officer:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEmail:\r\ndatenschutzbeauftragter@upjers.com\r\n\r\n\r\n
