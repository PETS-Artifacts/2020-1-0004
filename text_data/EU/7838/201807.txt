Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information that a user’s device (computer, tablet or mobile) downloads when it visits a website. They     allow the site to “remember” your computer, but not specifically who is using it, and improve your user experience. By associating the identification     numbers in the cookies with other customer information when, for example, you log-in to the site, then we know that the cookie information relates to you. 2.  What is the scope of cookies? Cookies are used generally for different purposes, such as letting the user navigate between pages efficiently,     implementing the user's preferences and generally improving their browsing experience, by customizing the website according to their navigation and user     profile. They can also help ensure that the adverts that the user sees online are more relevant to them and their interests. 3.  What cookies do we use?   Our website uses several type of cookies for different purposes as better explained below in section 4 “Categories of cookies on Gucci.com”. In particular we use: A)  Session cookies, which only last for the duration of a browsing session. They are usually used to facilitate the access to the services on our website, to authenticate     you when you are a registered member, and to remember what a user has put in their shopping basket, and B)  Persistent cookies, which last for more than one visit. They are used to remember a user’s preferences and actions within the website. In this case, when a user returns to     our website, or visits sites that use the same cookies, the site reads the cookies and identifies the user’s browser. Among these cookies it is possible to refer to: C)  First party cookies, which are supplied by the website you are visiting, i.e., Gucci.com and can be read only by such site. For example the cookies that maintain products in     the shopping bag of a user who is in the meantime still surfing the site. First party cookies can be either session or permanent cookies. D) Third party cookies, which are meant to collect data in an anonymous way, for example analytics information, including browsing     statistics. Other third party cookies are meant to track our visitors’ response to our online promotional activities. This technology uses information     about your visits to our website and third parties' sites on which we advertise, to deliver relevant advertisements. We also use this to learn which banner     adverts bring users to our website. Also third party cookies can be either session or permanent cookies.   4.
