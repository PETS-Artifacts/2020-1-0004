This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we use your personal data collected via www.gucci.com ("Website"), and by other means (e.g., via social media, cookies, etc.). Please read this Policy carefully.             The personal data that you provide may be regarded as jointly controlled by Kering SA, by Gucci and by the Gucci local retail legal entities “Store”.     	         Personal Data We May Collect About You 	       	    	   We will collect various types of personal data about you for the purposes described in this Policy, including: 	    	           Contact information (such as your name,      birthday, nationality, email address, postal address, telephone number and      any other personal data) that you provide by completing forms on the      Website, including if you subscribe to our newsletter and register and      create an account on the Website;   Details of any transactions made by      you;   Personal data that may be contained in      communications you send to us, for example to report a problem or to      submit queries, concerns or comments regarding the Website or its content;         Information from surveys that we may,      from time to time, conduct on the Website for research purposes, if you      choose to respond to, or participate in, them;    Credit/debit card information, which is      considered to be sensitive personal data in certain countries such as      Mexico;    Information about your use and      navigation of our Website, such as your IP address and other device      identifiers, your operating system and browser type, and information about      the Website pages you visit, collected thanks to cookies; and   Personal information collected from      third parties, such as data that you agree to share with us on publicly      accessible social networks (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and/or that      we may collect from other publicly accessible databases.    You are under no obligation to provide any such information. Providing your personal data to us (in particular, your personal details, your email, your address, your credit/debit card numbers and bank code and your telephone number) is necessary for processing your order for the purchase of products on the Website, supplying other services provided on the Website upon your request, or when your personal data is needed to fulfil obligations required by law or regulations. The refusal to provide us with any personal data necessary for performing the above purposes may consequently prevent us from processing your order for the purchase of products sold on the Website or fulfilling obligations required by law and other regulations. Therefore, failure to provide personal data may constitute, in some cases, a legitimate and justified reason for not processing your order for the purchase of products sold on the Website or not providing the Website’s services. 	    	        Disclosure of further personal data to us other than that required for fulfilling legal or contractual obligations and to properly browse our services with necessary traffic data is, on the contrary, optional and does not have any effect on the use of the Website and of its services or on the purchase of products on the Website. We will inform you at every step whether disclosing your personal data to us is required or optional by marking with an appropriate symbol (*) the information that is required or data needed for the purchase of products and/or for the provision of requested services on the Website.     	         Minimum Age 	          Protecting the safety and privacy of children is very important to us. We do not accept registrations or orders submitted by, and will not knowingly collect or use personal data from anyone under the age of sixteen (16) years, or any other age limit sets out by the law of his/her country of residence. By registering or making any purchase on the Website, you confirm that you have reached the age of majority in your country of residence.                 Cookies               Our Website uses cookies. More information can be found in our            Cookie Policy.         Do-Not-Track. Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies).     	         Use Made of Your Personal Data 	           Whenever we process your personal data, we do so on the basis of a lawful "justification" (or legal basis) for processing. In the majority of cases, the processing of your personal data will be justified on one of the following bases: 	    	           processing is necessary to perform a      contract with you or take steps that you have requested in order to enter      into a contract (e.g., sale contract);   processing is necessary for us to      comply with a legal obligation;   processing is in our legitimate      interests as a business, and our interests are not overridden by      your interests, fundamental rights or freedoms.

For the best possible protection of your personal data outside the limits of our control, your device should be protected (such as by updated antivirus systems) and your internet service provider should take appropriate measures for the security of network data transmission (such as, for example, firewalls and anti-spam filtering). 	    	        While we take reasonable steps to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee that the  personal data you disclose to us will be 100% secure. 	    	        You accept the inherent security implications of dealing on-line over the Internet and will not hold Gucci, Kering or their processors responsible for any data breach unless it is due to our negligence. 	    	            	         Retention of Your Personal Data 	          Our general approach is to retain your personal data only for as long as required to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected. We generally retain your personal data for three years from the end of our relationship or from the last contact from you, unless local law requires otherwise. However, in some circumstances we may retain personal data for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, tax and accounting requirements. 	    	        In specific circumstances we may also retain your personal data for longer periods of time corresponding to the applicable statute of limitations so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges.   Your Rights You have the following rights with respect to your personal data:    Right      to withdraw consent - where applicable, you have the right to      withdraw your consent at any time.       For example, if you wish to opt-out of receiving      electronic marketing communications, you can change your settings in your      account on the Website, use the 'unsubscribe' link provided in our emails      or text the STOP number in our SMS, or otherwise contact us directly and      we will stop sending you communications.   Right      of access, rectification and erasure - you have the right to request access      to and obtain a copy of any of your personal data that we may hold, to      request correction of any inaccurate data relating to you and to request      the deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances. You can see and update most of this data      yourself online, or by contacting directly privacy@gucci.com.     Right of data portability - Under certain      conditions, you have the right to receive all such personal data which you      have provided to us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable      format, and also to require us to transmit it to another controller where      this is technically feasible.     Right to restriction of processing - you have the right to      restrict our processing of your personal data where:      you       contest the accuracy of the personal data until we have taken sufficient       steps to correct or verify its accuracy;      the       processing is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data;     we no       longer need your personal data for the purposes of the processing, but       you require such data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal       claims; or      you have objected to processing justified on       legitimate interest grounds (see below) pending verification as to       whether we have overriding compelling legitimate grounds to continue       processing.       Where personal data is subject to restriction in this way, we will only process it with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, in accordance with local legislation. 	    	       	    	      Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds - where we are relying      upon legitimate interest to process personal data, then you have the right      to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing      unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the      processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we      need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of      legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a justification      for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling      legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.     Information for California Residents - California residents may request a list of      certain third parties to which we have disclosed personal data about you      for their own direct marketing purposes. You may make one request per      calendar year. In your request, please attest to the fact that you are a      California resident and provide a current California address for your      response.

We will endeavour to respond to your request as soon as possible and in any case within the applicable timeframes. 	    	            	         Changes to this Policy 	          We may occasionally change this Policy, for example, to comply with new requirements imposed by the applicable laws or technical requirements.
