If you provide your personal information in conjunction with any Third-Party Services, you will be advised at the point of collection who is collecting the information and whose privacy policy applies. If there is any doubt, please contact HostPapa to clarify (see contact information below). If this Privacy Policy applies to such personal information, then HostPapa may be required to disclose your information to our trusted partner, sponsor, or affiliate in order to provide the Third-Party Services. If the privacy policy of our trusted partner, sponsor, or affiliate applies, HostPapa will make all reasonable efforts to ensure the third-party privacy policy is properly in place and complied with.

In many of these cases, you will be asked to provide personal information such as your name, email address, or other contact information, or credit/billing information. If you complete an order or provide personal information to a website or service that is not provided by HostPapa, HostPapa has no control over the third party’s use of any personal information. HostPapa therefore has no responsibility or liability for the manner in which the organizations that operate such linked websites may collect, use, disclose, secure, or otherwise deal with your personal information. HostPapa provides these links to other websites as a convenience to you.

However, HostPapa, its affiliates, trusted partners, and sponsors, may disclose your personal information, including your use of the services or websites accessible through the services, for any reason, in its sole discretion to comply with Canadian, U.S., or other laws, regulations, or governmental or legal requests or demands for such information, and act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of HostPapa or the public.Domain RegistrationIn certain jurisdictions or pursuant to the rules of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”) or certain registries, domain name registration information legally has to be available to the public. Where domain name registration information is available to the public, anyone can access it through “WHOIS” searches. The WHOIS database is a publicly accessible database that lists the domain name and contact information of the registrant and administrative and technical contacts for the domain name, the name server(s), and the domain name’s creation and expiration date. The domain name registration information you provide may be hosted by us and provided to the public. At times, users of HostPapa may receive solicitations that result from searches of the publicly available WHOIS database conducted by other companies or individuals. However, the solicitation and/or SPAM you receive does not in any way come from HostPapa and HostPapa does not control the use of WHOIS information by third parties. Further, pursuant to ICANN rules, HostPapa is required to make WHOIS data available to a third party that enters into a bulk access agreement. ICANN allows individuals to opt-out (using the account management panel, domain management console, or similar service) of their WHOIS information being made available to third parties through bulk access; however, companies, businesses, and other organizations do not have the option to choose not to have their information made available to such a third party under a bulk access agreement. HostPapa may also deposit your domain name registration information with a third-party escrow provider to comply with ICANN requirements.International Transfer of DataIf you visit HostPapa or its websites from a country other than the country in which our servers are located, your communications with HostPapa may result in the transfer of information across international borders. By using HostPapa services and communicating with HostPapa, you consent to such transfers.Use of CookiesHostPapa uses “cookies” to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize HostPapa pages, or register with a HostPapa site or service, a cookie helps HostPapa recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same HostPapa website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the HostPapa features that you customized.You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the HostPapa websites or services you visit.Security of Your Personal InformationHostPapa secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
