Ad Serving Privacy Policy


Beacons


Renegade Internet uses beacons, which are also commonly referred to as "impression beacons" or
"tracking pixels", in combination with cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising
campaigns. Advertisers may place beacons on their contact form and/or order form "thank you"
pages to identify leads and sales as resulting from an advertising campaign. The beacon does NOT collect
your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may personally identify you.


Cookies


Renegade Internet uses cookies to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
Cookies are small text files created and stored on your computer by your web browsing software
(i.e. Internet Explorer or Firefox) on behalf of web sites that you visit.  While cookies have
many applications, we use them only to assign an anonymous and unique ID number to you when you
view, click, or interact in some way with one of our client's advertisements. The cookie does NOT
include your name, address, phone number, email address, or any other information that may
personally identify you.



Internet Protocol Address


Renegade Internet uses Internet protocol (IP) addresses to measure the effectiveness of
advertising campaigns. Through the use of IP mapping technology, we are able to translate
your IP address into a geographic location, which may include a close approximation of
your Continent, Country, State/Province, City, and Postal/Zip Code. This technology does
NOT provide us with your street address, telephone number, or any other information that
may personally locate you.


Referrer URL


Renegade Internet uses Referrer URLs to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.
By examining the Referrer URL, we are able to determine which web site is displaying one of
our client's advertisements. We are NOT able to extract any information that may personally
identify you from the Referrer URL.


Third-Party Data


We receive information about consumers from third parties to enable targeted advertising on the
website(s) and application(s) that we support.  The collection and use of that data is governed by
the privacy policy and legal terms of the data collector and the website using the data; it is not
governed by Renegade Internet.


Guidelines


For guidelines concerning the acceptable use of Renegade Internet ad serving technology, including but
not limited to activities related to SPAM and spyware, please review our
acceptable use policy.
