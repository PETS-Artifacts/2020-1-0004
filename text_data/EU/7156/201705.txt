Birmingham City University Privacy Policy Statement (the "Privacy Policy")
Birmingham City University (hereafter referred to as "the University") is committed to safeguarding and preserving your privacy when visiting our family of sites or communicating electronically with us. This University Privacy Policy applies to all University websites and provides an explanation as to what happens to any personal data that you provide to us, or that we collect from you.
Information collected by the University
For each visitor to the University website, our web server automatically logs the visitor's activity. These log files include the details of the visitor's IP address, browser type, page last visited and other such information. Log files are used to analyse usage of the University website, and may be kept in an aggregated and anonymised form for historical records. We use the analysis to improve the content of our website. The University does not share this information with any other organisation for commercial purposes.
At some sites, the University collects personal information, such as your email address, name, home or work address or telephone number and information volunteered by the user, such as survey information, filling of website forms and site registrations. The University may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you. Information collected at the University's website may be shared within the University as a whole including the University's family of websites. Personal and demographic data may be stored and processed outside your country (if outside the United Kingdom) and by using the University's website, you consent to any such transfers being made outside your country.
Use of information collected by the University
Any information supplied by you will be used by the University for the purpose related to your enquiry and to operate the University websites and deliver the services that you have requested. The information will not be made available to any parties outside the University unless you have consented to this or if required to do so by law.
Disclosing your information
The University does not share the information collected through the website with any third parties, except research agencies or service providers, to assist with or carry out research and provide statistical information, by means of, for example, conducting telephone surveys or delivering email, direct mail or text messages on the University's behalf. The University ensures such agencies handle information in accordance with the Data Protection Act.
The University will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of the University and its group of websites and to protect the personal safety of users of the University, its websites, or the public.
