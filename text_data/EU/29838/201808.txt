By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.
In connection with LSC Communications’ processing of personal data it receives from the EU (“EU  Data”), LSC Communications adheres to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework  Principles issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “Principles”). For more information about the Principles, please visit the Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield website.

If LSC Communications does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield, LSC Communications’ designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider. Under certain conditions specified by the  Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.

If LSC Communications shares EU Data with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on LSC Communications’ behalf, then LSC Communications will be liable for that third party’s  processing of EU Data in violation of the Principles, unless LSC Communications can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
