This privacy policy, implemented by SendinBlue, is intended to provide the Users with a summary and overview of the processing of personal data carried out by SendinBlue.

The mandatory or optional nature of the data provided (in order to complete the Users’ registration and to render the Services) is indicated at the time of collection by an asterisk.
In addition, certain data is collected automatically as a result of the User’s actions on the site (see the paragraph on cookies).
Purposes
The personal data collected by SendinBlue during the provision of the Services is necessary for the performance of the contracts concluded with the Users, or to allow SendinBlue to pursue its legitimate interests while respecting the rights of the Users. Certain data may also be processed based on the Users’ consent.
The purposes for which SendinBlue processes data are the following:

commercial and accounting management of the contract;
management of customer acquisition and marketing activities;
detection of malicious behaviour (fraud, phishing, spam, etc.);
the improvement of the Users path on the site;
more generally, any purpose referred to in Article 2 of Deliberation No. 2012-209 of 21 June 2012 creating a simplified standard for the automated processing of personal data relating to the management of users and prospects.

Recipients of the data
The personal data collected is intended for SendinBlue’s commercial and accounting departments. It may be transmitted to SendinBlue’s subsidiaries, or to third-party data processors which SendinBlue is authorized to use within the context of the performance of its Services.
In this context, personal data may be transferred to an EU or non-EU country. SendinBlue implements guarantees ensuring the protection and security of this data, in compliance with applicable rules and regulations.
SendinBlue does not transfer or rent personal data to third parties for marketing purposes without the express consent of the Users of SendinBlue.
In addition, personal data may only be disclosed to third parties for purposes other than marketing in the following cases:

with their authorisation;
at the request of the competent legal authorities, upon judicial request, or in the context of a legal dispute.

Data retention period
To satisfy its legal obligations or in order to have the necessary elements to assert its rights, SendinBlue will be able to retain the data under the conditions established by applicable rules and regulations.
Thus, personal data collected by SendinBlue relating to the identity and contact details of its Users is retained for a maximum period of two years after the termination of the contractual relationship for Users that are customers, or from their collection by the data controller or the last contact from the Users that are prospects, for the data relating to the latter.
The termination of the contractual relationship is understood as the express termination of the contract by the User, or the non-use of SendinBlue Services for a period of five years.
Rights of Users
In accordance with applicable rules, the Users have the right to access and rectify their personal data, which enables them to rectify, complete, update, or delete data that is inaccurate, incomplete, ambiguous, or outdated, or whose collection, use, communication, or storage is prohibited.
The Users also have the right to request the limitation of the processing, and to oppose on legitimate grounds the processing of their personal data. The User may also communicate instructions on the fate of their personal data in the event of their death.
Where applicable, the User may request the portability of their personal data or, where the legal basis for the processing is consent, withdraw their consent at any time.
The Users may exercise their rights by sending an email to [email protected] or a letter to:
