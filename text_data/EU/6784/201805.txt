	Privacy Policy and Data Protection

RAC takes the privacy of your information very seriously. We aim to meet current Internet best practice. Our services are designed to give you the information that you want to receive. Our privacy policy below explains how we will collect and use the information you give us. We may vary this policy from time to time and the current version will be that published on this site. The word 'we' refers to RAC Motoring Services (RACMS), unless otherwise indicated.

Collecting your information

	From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (e.g. name and email address etc) in order to receive or use services on our website. These services include newsletters and competitions, live chats and message boards and personalised services such as "My RAC". We will also need personal information in order to supply other products and services or to help us identify you when you contact us. When we collect this information we will only do so over a secure connection. If you communicate with us by email over the Internet you should be aware that the nature of the Internet is such that unencrypted communication may not be secure and may pass through several different countries on route to us. Please do not email us with confidential or sensitive information such as your credit card details. We cannot accept responsibility for unauthorised access to your information that is outside our control.

	We may combine this information with other information that we may hold about you if you are an RAC member, or have made enquiries of us before. We may also obtain information from publicly available sources suchas the electoral roll, or other third parties who have a legitimate basis on which to pass on your information.

	We will act in accordance with current legislation and we will provide a link to our Data Protection Notice every time we invite you to submit personal information to us. Our Data Protection Notice is given below.

This is information relating to your health generally and also to any relevant convictions. We pass information, which may include this sensitive data, to the insurance companies from whom we obtain quotations.
