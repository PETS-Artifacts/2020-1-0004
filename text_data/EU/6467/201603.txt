										being used without your consent, we will validate name, address
										and other personal information supplied by you during the order
										process against appropriate third party databases. By continuing
										to use the website you accept these terms and conditions and
										accordingly consent to such checks being made. In performing these
										checks personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a
										registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that
										information for payment clearance, credit reference, order
										fulfilment, delivery, data analysis or customer support. You can
										rest assured that this is done only to confirm your identity, that
										a credit check is not performed and that your credit rating will
										be unaffected.
We may need to disclose your personal data where we are
										under a legal duty to comply with any legal obligation or in order
										to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions and other agreements.

										safety of our customers or others which includes exchanging
										information with other companies and organisations for the
										purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
