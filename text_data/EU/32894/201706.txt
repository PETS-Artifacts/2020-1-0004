Screencast-O-Matic Privacy Policy

                    This Privacy Policy is a part of our Terms of Service ("TOS"), and describes how we collect, use and handle your information when you use our Services
                    ("TOS" and other capitalized terms are used as defined in the TOS). We respect your right to privacy and feel it is important for you to know how we handle
                    the information we receive from you via our Services.
                

Information You Provide


                    We collect and use the following information to provide, improve, promote, and protect our Services and to offer effective advertising, which helps us keep
                    most of our Services free:
                

                    Account. We may ask you to provide, and if provided will associate with your account, information like your name, email address, phone number, payment
                    info, and physical address. Some of our services let you access your accounts and your information with other service providers. You can modify your
                    account information while logged in by clicking on your username in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen.
                

                    Services. When you use our Services to upload Your Content, we store, process and transmit Your Content and related information (for example, title and
                    description). Pro Users have the option to password protect their screencasts from public viewing. If you do not select the paid Pro service, Your Content
                    may be available to and viewable by the public, including other users. We also collect anonymous usage statistics from our Software.
                

                    Email Communications: We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. We use this confirmation to improve our Services, including customer
                    service.
                

                    Usage. We collect information from and about the devices you use to access the Services. This includes things like IP addresses, the type of browser and
                    device you use, the web page you visited before coming to our sites, and identifiers associated with your devices. Your devices (depending on their
                    settings) may also transmit location information to the Services. We may use this usage- and device-related information in order to provide and improve the
                    Services.
                

                    Cookies and other technologies. We use technologies like cookies and pixel tags to provide, improve, protect and promote our Services. For example, cookies
                    help us with things like remembering your username for your next visit, understanding how you are interacting with our Services, and improving them based
                    on that information. You can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may limit your ability to use the Services.
                

                    You may choose not to provide us with any personal information. In such event, you can still access and use many portions of the Services; however, you
                    will not be able to access and use those portions of the Services that require your personal information.
                

Information Sharing


                    We may share information as discussed below, but we will not sell or rent your information to 3rd parties
                

                    Our ability to provide free content and services depends on advertising. We use advertising on our site, for example on pages that you use to embed
                    uploaded videos for viewing. Some of our ads are displayed based on the page visited, but some advertisements that appear on the Screencast-O-Matic website
                    are targeted to you based on your interests and other information we have about you. For example, we utilize interest-based advertising ("IAB") services
                    offered by Google, Inc. You can learn more about IAB, and opt out of targeted ads offered by many IAB service providers, at the National Advertising
                    Initiative Consumer Opt-Out webpage, located at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices


                    Others working for Screencast-O-Matic. Screencast-O-Matic uses certain trusted third parties to help us provide, improve, protect, and promote our
                    Services. These third parties will access your information only to perform tasks on our behalf and in compliance with this Privacy Policy.
                

                    We may disclose your information to third parties, including government officials, if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a)
                    comply with the law; (b) protect any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Screencast-o-matic or our users; or (d)
                    protect Screencast-o-matic's property rights.
                

                    We may also provide aggregated, non-personally identifiable information to third parties for any legal purposes whatsoever.
                

Information Protection


                    Security. Screencast-O-Matic maintains reasonable security measures to help protect your information from loss, destruction, misuse, unauthorized access or
                    disclosure. These technologies help ensure that your data is safe, secure, and only available to you and to those you provided authorized access. However,
                    no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

                    news groups. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing your personal
                    information via these public venues, which you do at your own risk. Screencast-O-Matic cannot safeguard the privacy of personal information that is
                    disclosed online in this manner.
                

                    Other Websites: When using the Services, you may be directed to other third party websites that are beyond our control. These other websites may use
                    cookies and pixel tags, collect data, or solicit personal information. Screencast-O-Matic has no control over such third party websites, nor over how they
                    collect, distribute or otherwise use your personal information or how they safeguard and secure your personal information. Screencast-O-Matic is not
                    responsible or liable for the conduct, policies or actions of the owners of such third party websites or the content displayed on these websites. Any third
                    party websites are linked to the Services only for your convenience and you access them at your own risk.
