From Project Gutenberg, the first producer of free ebooks.
If you read the Gutenberg web site, no more information is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites in general.

Wiki Authors
If you contribute to the Project Gutenberg Wiki, you are publishing every word you post publicly. If you write something, assume that it will be retained forever. This includes articles, user pages and talk pages.

Links to Third Party Websites
This includes Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and maybe more.
Project Gutenberg does link to third party sites wherever users have come to expect this. Many of those sites are notorious wholesale collectors of private data (which they freely share with the NSA). 
However, we are very careful to link in a manner that does not allow those third party websites to see what you are doing on Project Gutenberg unless you explicitly click on one of those links. If you click on a third party link, you will leave the Project Gutenberg website, and we cannot tell you what the other site will do with your data.
