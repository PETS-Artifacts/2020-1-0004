 We need some personal data to be able to deal with your flight booking. When you visit our website, by default our web servers save the IP address of your internet service provider, the website you used to reach our homepage, the webpages you visit at Eurowings, as well as the date and duration of your visit. Eurowings uses cookies to track visitor preferences and adapt our webpages accordingly. The first time you book with Eurowings we ask you to provide specific information, such as your name, address, postal address, telephone number and email address, and then to select a user name and a password. We store this data so that you do not have to re-enter it when you subsequently book online. Alongside this we ask for your payment details, such as bank details, account number or credit card number, every time you make a booking. The flight booking is carried out via SSL (secure socket layer), which transmits the data securely between your web browser and our booking system. Furthermore, personal data is only stored if you choose to provide it to us, for instance when you register, fill out a survey, enter a competition or provide it as part of a contract (e.g. a flight). In line with EU directive 996/2010, Eurowings offers every passenger the option of appointing a contact person to be informed in the event of an emergency. They can appoint this person through our call centre. This information is linked to the booking and only used for the purposes stipulated in directive 996/2010. It will be deleted 48 hours after the final flight listed in the booking. Data regarding the flight, passengers, additional services and contact and payment details is also stored beyond the duration of the contract. You can access this data at any time in your profile under 'My bookings'.
