-	Personal data is being collected by the payment processor, and once the transaction has been completed, the customer contact details collected are shared with us for ongoing support purposes
-	Payment processors we work with will not use the data collected for any other purposes than those related to legal and tax requirements, risk management practices (thus ensuring fair commerce transactions), and ongoing support purposes
-	Personal data will be used for sending out activation codes and registration instructions regarding the license you purchase and related products
-	Personal data will be written on envelope and communicated to postal and expedited shipment service companies for deliveries of tangible goods
-	We may disclose personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal requirements, to protect and defend our rights or property, or in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of an individual
-	We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so
