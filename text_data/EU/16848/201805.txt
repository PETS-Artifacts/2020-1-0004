Use of Cookies
Cookies are pieces of information left in the settings of your web browser to identify your computer to a website when you enter. Whenever a website welcomes you and tailors data to your specifications, it is reading a cookie and identifying information you may have registered during previous visits. Helicon Soft Ltd. uses cookies to record your viewing preferences help us estimate and report the size of our viewing community and traffic. While these activities depend on the use of a "cookie", visitors to Helicon Soft Ltd. always have the option of disabling cookies via their internet browser preferences. Users should be aware that when you are on Helicon Soft Ltd., you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites that take you outside of our service.
