Privacy
7hops.com Inc. (“ZergNet”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies
    and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable
    information received from users of ZergNet’s website, located at the domain zergnet.com
    (the “ZergNet Website"). Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the ZergNet
    Website.
Information Collection and Use
It is not necessary to provide ZergNet with your personally identifiable information to
    use the ZergNet Website, and ZergNet does not collect personally identifiable
    information in connection with the operation of the ZergNet Website.  If you contact
    ZergNet by email through the ZergNet Website, ZergNet may keep a record of your
    contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any
    information that you provide to ZergNet in your message, to respond to you.  ZergNet
    treats this information as it would treat any other unsolicited business correspondence,
    and has no obligation to keep this information confidential, nor to take any security
    measures to protect this information.
When you visit the ZergNet Website, ZergNet’s servers automatically record information
    that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may
    include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you
    are visiting. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider, the
    IP address will be different every time you log on. ZergNet uses Log Data to monitor use
    of the ZergNet Website and the services we offer via the ZergNet Website and for the
    ZergNet Website’s technical administration.
Cookies
Like many websites, ZergNet also uses "cookie" technology to collect additional website
    usage data and to improve the ZergNet Website and the services offered via the Web Site.
    A cookie is a small data file that ZergNet’s servers transfer to your computer’s hard disk.
    ZergNet does not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. However, IP
    addresses are collected by the use of cookies.
ZergNet mainly uses "session cookies", which enable certain features of the ZergNet
    Website and services offered via the ZergNet Website, to better understand how you
    interact with the Web Site and services we offer via the ZergNet Website, to monitor
    aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the ZergNet Website, and to
    improve the ZergNet Website and services offered via the ZergNet Website. Session
    cookies should be deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the
    ZergNet Website.
ZergNet also uses a persistent cookie that stays on your computer after you leave the
    ZergNet Website, for the sole purpose of ensuring that you receive a variety of ZergNet
    content (also called “frequency-capping”).
Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by
    editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie
    from the websites you visit.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
ZergNet cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties, to
    enforce and comply with the law. ZergNet may disclose any information about you to
    government or law enforcement officials or private parties as ZergNet, in its sole
    discretion, believes necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process
    (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of ZergNet or a third party, the
    safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally
    actionable activity, or to comply with the law.
If any or all of the assets of ZergNet are acquired by, or merged with another entity,
    ZergNet will share with this entity some or all of the information collected through the
    ZergNet Website.
Security
Because ZergNet does not collect any personally identifiable information from the
    ZergNet Website, ZergNet does not take any specific security measures to protect the
    information we do collect.
Links to Other Sites
The ZergNet Website may contain links to other web sites ("Linked Sites") operated by
    ZergNet or third parties. Linked Sites may place their own cookies or other files on your
    computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. This Privacy Policy
    addresses only the use and disclosure of information that ZergNet collects through the
    ZergNet Website. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the
    personal information you submit to them. ZergNet does not exercise control over third
    party Linked Sites. Your use of any Linked Site operated by ZergNet is subject to the
    terms and conditions provided by ZergNet for such Linked Site.  ZergNet encourages you
    to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.
Our Policy Towards Children
The ZergNet Website is not directed to children under 18. If a parent or guardian
    becomes aware that his or her child has provided ZergNet with personally identifiable
    information without their consent, he or she should contact ZergNet
    at info@zergnet.com.  If ZergNet becomes aware that a child under 13 has provided
    ZergNet with personally identifiable information, ZergNet will remove such information
    from our files.
