                    Our service providers include, for example, data centers, analysis service providers,
                    and payment service providers. Our service providers are prohibited from processing
                    your data for other purposes or for themselves. It is important to us that you can find out
                    at any time from the following information which personal data is collected during your
                    visit to our website and when ordering in our shop and how we process it afterwards.
                


Your rights in data protection and right to cancel 
You have the following rights regarding the processing of personal data:


                        Right of access by the data subject to the personal data concerned
                    

                        Right to rectification or erasure or restriction of processing
                    

                        If the processing of your personal data is based on a weighing of interests
                        (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or if the processing is necessary for the performance of a
                        task which is in the public interest or is carried out in the exercise of official
                        authority vested in the controller (Art. 6 (1) (e) GDPR), the right to object to the processing.
                        We will inform you about this in detail in the following sections.
                    

                        Right to data transfer
                    

                        If the processing of your personal data is based on your consent
                        (Art. 6 (1) (a) or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR), you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We will inform you about this in detail in the following sections.
                    

                        Right of appeal to a supervisory authority
                    


                    You have the right to object to the processing of your data at any time for reasons arising from your
                    particular situation if the legal requirements are met. If you object to the processing of your data for advertising
                    purposes or wish to revoke your consent, a short message to our data protection officer by email to
                    datenschutz@add-yet.de or by post to InterNations GmbH, Schwanthalerstr. 39, 80336 Munich, Germany is
                    sufficient at any time. Your data will then no longer be processed for the advertising purposes covered by the
                    advertising objection or the revocation of consent. This does not affect the legality of the processing carried
                    out until the objection or revocation. After your objection to the processing of your personal data for advertising
                    purposes or the revocation of your consent, we are obliged under data protection law in accordance with the
                    requirements of the German data protection supervisory authorities to include the necessary data (name, address, e-mail address)
                    in our internal advertising blacklist and - only for this purpose - to permanently store (block) and use for
                    comparison with our future advertising files. (Art. 21 (3), Art.17 (3) (b), Art.6 (1) (c) GDPR).
                    In this way, compliance with your advertising objection or the revocation of your consent can
                    be permanently ensured. If you have any questions about the processing of your personal data by us, we will of course be
                    happy to provide you with information about the data concerning you at any time. Furthermore, you have a right to correction,
                    deletion, restriction of processing, objection, and the right to data transfer if the legal requirements are met.
                    In all these cases, please contact our data protection officer (see contact data under item 1) at the communication
                    addresses listed there. Finally, you have the right to complain to a competent data protection supervisory authority.
                


Processing of personal data on our website


                        Visiting our website
                        
                            InterNations GmbH - as it is usual and necessary for internet pages to be used - processes
                            so-called server log files when you visit our internet page. When our website is accessed,
                            our web server records the domain name or the IP address of your computer, the file name,
                            and the URL which was requested, as well as the http response code and, if applicable, the
                            URL referring to our website (legal basis: Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). This procedure is
                            technically necessary and customary to enable the use of our website. Here we are supported
                            by our technical service providers, which we use as contract processors. The above-mentioned
                            data is logged and used for the purpose of defense against illegal use or attempted attacks
                            on our web server (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR). The data will be deleted after 60 days.
                        


                        Registration on the platform
                        
                            If you register for our platform on our website, we process the data provided for this purpose in order to provide you
                            with the platform (legal basis: Art.  6 (1) (b) GDPR).
                            The mandatory information requested during registration is a prerequisite for fulfilling the service.
                            We require your date of birth as proof of age, as our offer is only aimed at persons who have reached the age of 18.
                            We need your email address to send you a confirmation and notifications.
                            Within the scope of registration and use of our service, the processing is necessary for the fulfilment of the contractual
                            service such as the provision of the platform and payment processing.
                            The contract with you is thus the legal basis for this processing (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR).
                            We will also process your data to the extent required by law to fulfill our archiving and storage obligations in
                            accordance with German commercial and tax law (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR).
                            The provision of personal data and registration data is necessary for the conclusion of the contract.
                            In addition, we use your data for direct advertising - i.e. to send you information about our services and campaigns (in
                            accordance with Art.
                            6 (1) (f) GDPR) in order to win you as a customer (information in accordance with Art. 13 (1) (d) GDPR).
                            You can object to the use of your data for advertising purposes at any time under the above contact details.
                            We will process your data within the scope of registration as long as you do not request deletion, unless there are
                            contractual or legal reasons for not doing so.
                        


                        Registration on the platform premium
                        
                            If you order a service from us, it will be processed to fulfill the contractual service such as delivery and payment
                            processing. The sales contract with you is the legal basis for this processing (Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR). We will also process
                            your data to the extent required by law to fulfill our archiving and storage obligations under German commercial and tax
                            law (Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR). In addition, we use your data for direct advertising - i.e. to send you information about our
                            products and campaigns (in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) in order to win you as a customer (information in
                            accordance with Art. 13 (1) (d) GDPR). You can object to the use of your data for advertising purposes at any time under
                            the above-mentioned contact data. Further recipients of these data within the scope of the handling of the contract about
                            the order are payment service providers (only payment data). The duration of the processing depends on the purpose of the
                            fulfillment of the contract as well as the associated further legal requirements for storage and proof. We use the data
                            for direct advertising as long as you have not objected.
                        


                        User content
                        
                            After successful registration with InterNations, you may provide additional information about yourself (e.g. international
                            experience, professional background, interests). Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration
                            is entirely optional and on a voluntarily basis but enables you to better use our services. Additionally, you can upload,
                            publish, send, or display comments, photos, profiles, messages, notes, text, information, music, video, advertisements,
                            listings, and other content (User Content) on or through InterNations, or transmit to or share with other users accessing
                            the InterNations websites. You may also form relationships with other users, perform searches and queries, and form
                            groups. InterNations collects all the aforementioned information so that InterNations can provide you with the services
                            and offer personalized features. In most cases, InterNations retains the information so that, for instance, you can return
                            to view prior messages you have sent.

                        

                            If you visit a profile of another user of InterNations, this user may see that you have visited his/her profile. This
                            feature is an essential part of contact management on InterNations and as such an essential part of the InterNations
                            services.
                        

                            Any information and user content (except personal messages to other users) you have submitted to InterNations or to others
                            via our platform may be accessed by third parties when they visit the InterNations websites. Such information and content
                            may also be found and made accessible by search engines.
                        

                            If you choose to invite other people to InterNations to join your network, the names and email addresses of the invitees
                            need to be entered. The names and email addresses of people that are invited will be used by InterNations only to send
                            your invitation email (including an optional personal message) and corresponding reminders. InterNations stores this
                            information to send the invitation email, to register a contact connection if your invitation is accepted, and to track
                            the success of InterNations’ referral program.

                            States. The Google Analytics cookie (legal basis Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) is stored because of our legitimate interest in
                            analyzing user behavior in order to optimize our website and advertising. We are supported in this by Google as a contract
                            processor. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating the user's use of the website, compiling reports
