                        Sharing Personal Data with other Users of InterNations or third parties
                        
                            Profile information the User submits to InterNations will be available to other Users of
                            InterNations depending on the User’s chosen individual privacy settings.
                        

                            Posting User Content on or through the InterNationsService or the InterNationsWebsites, or
                            transmitting to or sharing with other Users on the InterNationsWebsites is at the User’s own
                            risk. Although InterNations allows the User to set privacy options that limit access to
                            his/her personal information, the User should be aware that no security measures are perfect
                            or impenetrable and the User’s Personal Data, his/her User Content and other information may
                            become publicly available. InterNations cannot control the actions of other Users with whom
                            the User may choose to share data and information. Therefore, InterNations cannot and does
                            not guarantee that Personal Data, User Content, and other information the User posts on
                            InterNationsWebsites will not be viewed by unauthorised persons. InterNations is not
                            responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the
                            InterNationsWebsites. The User understands and acknowledges that, even after removal, copies
                            of Personal Data, User Content, and other information may remain viewable in cached and
                            archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored this data and information.
                        

                            Any information and User Content (except personal messages to other Users) the User has
                            submitted to InterNations or to others via the Plattform may be accessed by third parties
                            (i.e. non-registered users) when they visit InterNationsWebsites. Such information and
                            content may also be found and made accessible by search engines (e.g. Google, MSN, Yahoo
                            etc.).
                        


                        Newsletters, Emails, and Notifications to Users
                        
                            InterNations regularly sends out newsletters, service-related announcements, or other
                            notification messages and emails (alltogther "Member Communication") to all Users of
                            InterNations. Through this Member Communication InterNations informs the User, among other
                            things, about new features, changes in his/her network or local community, invitation
                            requests, and new messages. InterNations may also provide the User with specific personal
                            statistics.
                        

                            As part of the Member Communication, InterNations may present new Users of InterNations to
                            the User. It may also be the case that InterNations presents the User as a possible contact
                            to other Users of InterNations. Finally, InterNations may inform the User about random Users
                            of InterNations who have visited the User’s profile. Of course, this may also apply to the
                            User vice versa, i.e., the User may be one of those random Users with regard to another User
                            of InterNations whose profile the User has visited.
                        

                            Generally, the User may opt out of such Member Communication through his/her individual
                            personal settings, though InterNations reserves the right to send the User notices about
                            his/her account even if the User opts out of all voluntary forms of the Member
                            Communication.
                        


                        Information Sharing with Third Parties
                        
                            InterNations does not forward the User’s Personal Data, his/her User Content, or other
                            information to third-party marketers without the User’s permission. InterNations shares
                            Personal Data, his/her User Content, and other information with third parties only in
                            limited circumstances where InterNations believes such sharing is legally permitted and
                            either 1) reasonably necessary to offer the InterNationsService or, 2) legally required or,
                            3) permitted by the User. For example:
                        

                            InterNations may forward Personal Data, User Content and other information to service
                            providers (including service providers located outside the European Union) to help
                            InterNations offer the InterNationsServices. Specifically, InterNations may use third
                            parties to facilitate InterNations’ business, such as to host the service at a co-location
                            facility for servers, to send out email updates about InterNations, to remove repetitive
                            information from User lists, to process payments for products or services, or to provide
                            search results or links. In connection with these offerings and business operations, the
                            InterNations’ service providers may have access to the User’s Personal Data, his/her User
                            Content and other information for use for a limited time in connection with these business
                            activities. Where InterNations utilizes third parties for the processing of any personal
                            information, InterNations will implement reasonable contractual and technical protections
                            limiting the use of that information to the InterNations-specified purposes.
                        

                            InterNations may be required to disclose Personal Data, User Content or other information in
                            compliance with applicable laws or pursuant to lawful requests, such as subpoenas or court
                            orders. InterNations does not reveal information unless InterNations has the bonafide belief
                            that an information request by law enforcement or private litigants meets applicable legal
                            standards. Additionally, InterNations may share account or other information when
                            InterNations believes it is necessary to comply with the law, to protect the interests or
                            property of InterNations, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the
                            InterNationsService or using the InterNations name, or to prevent imminent bodily harm. This
                            may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, agents, or government
                            agencies.
                        

                            If the complete or partial ownership of the InterNations business, or individual business
                            units owned by InterNations GmbH, were to change, the User’s personal information may be
                            transferred to the new owner or shareholder. In any such transfer, the User’s Personal Data,
                            his/her User Content, and other information would remain subject to the promises made in any
                            pre-existing Privacy Policy.
                        

                            InterNations may use the User’s Personal Data, his/her User Content, or any other
                            information in an anonymous way without identifying the User as an individual to third
                            parties. This includes for instance providing aggregated data about the usage of the
                            InterNationsService to third parties for such purposes as InterNations deems to be
                            appropriate. InterNations may segment its Users by e.g., gender, age, geographic location,
                            nationality, or employer.
