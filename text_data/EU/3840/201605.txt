A recent ruling in the European Court of Justice has essentially placed the Safe Harbor framework on hold. Subsequently, the protection of trans-Atlantic data was in question. And on February 2, 2016, a new version of Safe Harbor was revealed: EU-US Privacy Shield. While waiting for this updated agreement to be accepted, Qualtricsâ€™ position is to continue using industry best methods to protect all customer data, and is presently investigating the new developments in the privacy realm.
