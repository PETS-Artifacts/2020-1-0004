This privacy statement explains how Qualtrics handles personal data collected during the normal course of business (sales, marketing, and support), as well as how data are processed in its products and services.Qualtrics participates in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, and retained the American Arbitration Association/International Centre for Dispute Resolution.
Qualtrics products
Qualtrics creates the most advanced online survey software for corporations, research companies, and universities. The software is provided in an Application Service Provider (ASP) model, accessed using a modern browser via the Internet. All of Qualtrics products are self-service, whereby the end-users are solely responsible for what data to collect and from whom. Survey respondents may use mobile devices to complete a survey.
All customer data collected using the software are stored in a single secure data center; data do not “float” around in the cloud.
Surveys may be distributed in numerous ways: via email, a web link, or off-line mobile app. Surveys may require a password or other authentication by the respondent.
Data collected during normal business transactions (unrelated to the software)
For the www.qualtrics.com site: Qualtrics collects and analyzes aggregate information of visitors, including the domain name, visited surveys, referring URLs, and other publicly available information. We use this information to help improve our website and services, and to customize the content of our pages for each individual customer. Cookies may be used to customize content delivered to website visitors.
Qualtrics does not sell or make available specific information about our customers or their clients except as requested by a valid court order or otherwise required by law. We maintain a database of user information which is used only for internal purposes such as technical support, marketing-related activities, and to notify customers of changes or enhancements to the services. Qualtrics uses secure services for online credit card payment transactions, and does not record or store credit card information on its site or servers.
Data collected by customers
For this section, customers are end-users with valid Qualtrics accounts. Customers own and control all information they input into the Qualtrics software (“Data”), and any information generated from that Data. Depending on how the Customer chooses to use the software, Data may include personal information. Customers manage all Data, as well as the users who create, manage, distribute, or report the Data.
Qualtrics treats all Data as highly confidential and does not classify or represent the Data because only the Customer itself knows what data it’s collecting. In other words, Qualtrics provides the services, and Customers use the services as they wish. All Data are safeguarded using industry best security practices that prevent unlawful disclosure.
Qualtrics is presently undergoing certification under the FedRAMP program, the “gold standard” of security compliance. FedRAMP has over 900 controls based on the highly-regarded NIST 800-53, and requires constant monitoring and periodic independent assessments. More information is found at https://www.fedramp.gov/marketplace/in-process-systems/qualtrics-qualtrics-insight-platform/
Qualtrics will only process Data for the sole purpose of providing the software and services. Customers must ensure that they follow applicable laws when distributing surveys. This includes following applicable law when collecting personal and health information, preventing unsolicited emails from being sent, and deleting personal information when no longer required.
Qualtrics will never transfer Data to a third-party without the written permission of the customer. In other words, there is no onward transfer.
Qualtrics employees do not actively view Customer Data. Any access to Customer accounts requires consent by the end-user, and any exposure to personal information is incidental to providing the services. Customers have the ability to disable Qualtrics support from accessing their accounts. But by doing so, it may hinder timely responses and the quality of support.

Qualtrics is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and individuals have a right to contact the FTC regarding services provided by Qualtrics.
