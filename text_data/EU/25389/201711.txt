Please note that in order to take part in some of our functions and activities and to get access to some of our products or services, it will be necessary for you to provide information that identifies you such as your e-mail address, name, mailing address, telephone number and social security number (“Personal Data”) on certain areas of the Site.

        Collection and use of Personal Data and other user information
        

The information you submit to HUSQVARNA is protected by data protection laws. Personal Data is recorded and managed by HUSQVARNA and used in order to assist with the use of our products and/or online services. If you give us Personal Data in order to receive information in return from us – for instance brochures, catalogues – we collect and store that information. That information enables us to fulfil your information request. The information will be stored in a reasonably secure and protected environment for as long as HUSQVARNA believes it will improve the communication with you. If you wish to remove some or all of your details from our register, please contact the Husqvarna Professional Products Inc at 9335 Harris Corners Pkwy, Charlotte, NC 28269.
HUSQVARNA might request additional non-mandatory information from you in order to improve its knowledge of its customers or to conduct direct marketing or invite you to contests. You are free to respond to any such requests for additional information. 
HUSQVARNA also collects non-personal information about the usage of our Site through the use of Cookies. This information is collected on an aggregate basis and is only used for internal purposes in order to help us improve your online experience and facilitate your visit to the Site. HUSQVARNA may connect this information to user Personal Data to determine which users access what materials, which allows us to improve the Site.
HUSQVARNA does not knowingly gather any Personal Data from children under the age of 18 and does not aim its website at such persons. We advise parents and custodians to take an active interest in children’s activities and interests online.

        Cookies
        





    The Site may use a technology called “cookies”. Cookies are small text files containing information that are saved on your computer by the webpage that you are visiting. They are used to help provide additional functionality to the Site and to help us analyze Site usage. There are two kinds of cookies: One kind is used for "remembering" information such as your username and password and is stored on your computer for as long as you decide to not "log out" of this subscription service. If you don't use the function "Don't ask for my username and password in the future" such cookies will never be stored on your computer.
    




    The other kind is a so called session cookie. It is used to keep track of, for example, which language you have chosen on the webpage. During the time you visit a site, such cookies are saved temporarily in the memory of your computer. A session cookie is not stored for a long time on your computer and usually disappears when you close your web browser. By using such cookies, HUSQVARNA hopes to better target relevant information to our visitors.
    



    
        If you do not wish to accept HUSQVARNA's use of cookies, most browsers allow you to configure your browser to reject cookies by modifying your browser settings. However, this might limit functionality and your benefit of the Site.
