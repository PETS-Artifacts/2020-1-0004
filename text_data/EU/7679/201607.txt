When you shop with us, you give us certain personal details, such as your name, email address and payment address. We hold such information securely using SSL encryption software. SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer which is the industry standard security technology for keeping data private during online transactions. This means your personal information cannot be read by anyone who should not see it.
You will notice the web address (URL) changes from http to https when you go through to the WHSmith.co.uk checkout or My Account pages. This shows that the site is using SSL and your details are protected.
We comply with all applicable data protection legislation, and we treat all your personal information as confidential. We are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that provides a safe online experience.
To process your order efficiently, reputable third-party banking and distribution institutions handle the credit and debit card transactions and order fulfilment. They receive the information needed to verify and authorise your payment card and to process your order. These organisations are under strict legal and contractual obligations to keep your personal information private.
