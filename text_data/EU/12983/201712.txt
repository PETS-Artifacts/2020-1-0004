This website uses cookies, web analytics and web logs to collect information about your use of our site, information about your computer such as your computer’s IP address and browser type, demographic data and, if you arrived at our site via a link from a third party site, the URL of the linking page. If you have registered an account with us, it may also collect your name and email address. 
The use of such cookies is normal practice and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies do not personally identify users but they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept Cookies. Our approved advertising partners use cookies and web beacons to provide advertising to you and to enable us to manage our relationship with those advertisers. For example, these cookies and web beacons help track how many unique users have seen a particular advertisement across our site or a third party site so that advertisers can target advertising to users that will be more relevant to their interests.
Cookie Opt-Outs
 Some people find the idea of a website storing information on their device a little intrusive, in particular when the information is stored and used by a third party. For example, you may object to being served advertising which is targeted to your interests based on your browsing history. If you would prefer to opt out of cookies, it is possible to control cookies by following the steps below, however you should be aware that you might lose some features and functionality of the website if you do so.
Cookies, including those which have already been set, can be deleted from your hard drive. You can also change the preferences/settings in your web browser to control cookies. In some cases, you can choose to accept cookies from the primary site, but block them from third parties. In others, you can block cookies from specific advertisers, or clear out all cookies. Deleting or blocking cookies may reduce functionality of the site. To learn more about how to reject cookies, visit www.allaboutcookies.org or go to the help menu within your internet browser.

Opting out of Behavioural Advertising Cookies:
If you would like to disable “third party” cookies generated by advertisers or providers of targeted advertising services, you can turn them off by going to the third party’s website and getting them to generate a one-time “no thanks” cookie that will stop any further cookies being written to your machine.

Any change to this Privacy Policy will be posted on this website and will become effective 5 days after posting.

Registration/User Names
By registering on the Schooldays.ie website, registered users can participate in our online Discussion Forums, surveys,  comment on news stories and receive updates on specific schools.  Care should be taken when selecting a 'User Name' on registration as usernames are displayed beside posts/comments and you may not wish to be identifiable.  For this reason, if you are registering with a view to participating on discussion boards,  it may be more appropriate to select a user name such as 'Butterfly123' or 'Mumof7' etc rather than using your own name.  We also recommend that when posting comments, childminding ads etc, that you do not post details of your mobile phone number but rather ask respondents to PM (private message) you with their contact details.

Forums and public communication.
"Forum" means a chat area, discussion board, bulletin board, or e-mail function offered as part of the Schooldays.ie online presence. You shall not upload to, distribute through, or otherwise publish through the Schooldays.ie website any content which is libellous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, threatening, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, abusive, illegal, or otherwise objectionable that would constitute or encourage a criminal offence, violate the rights of any party, or that would otherwise give rise to liability or violate any law. 

The forums shall be used only in a non-commercial manner. You shall not, without our express written approval, distribute or otherwise publish any material containing any solicitation of funds, promotion, advertising, or solicitation for goods or services. You specifically acknowledge that soliciting other guests to join or become members of any commercial online service or other organisation is expressly prohibited. You must also follow the house rules whenever you are using any Schooldays.ie website. 

It is our policy to respect the privacy of all guests. Therefore, in addition to the privacy of registration data (see our privacy policy), we will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of a guest's e-mail unless required in the course of normal maintenance of the Schooldays.ie website and its systems or unless required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or comply with legal process served on Schooldays.ie; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Schooldays.ie; or (3) act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our guests or the public. Guests shall remain solely responsible for the content of their messages. 

By uploading materials to any forum or submitting any materials to us, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such materials has expressly granted) us a perpetual, royalty-free, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium, or technology now known or later developed throughout the universe. In addition, you warrant that all so-called "moral rights" in those materials have been waived.

Parents School Feedback Survey
To complete the Parent Feedback survey, participants must register on the site which requires that you provide an email address and password.  This is to help prevent misuse of the site.   Details of participants email addresses will not be provided to any third party and participants in the survey are not identified in any way on the site.  On registering on the site to participate in the survey you will also have the option to participate in general discussion forums, receive updates on individual schools etc  so it is important to consider the 'username' you select when registering - i.e. it may be more appropriate to select a user name such as 'Butterfly123' or 'Mumof7' etc rather than using your own name.
