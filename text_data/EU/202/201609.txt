Summary of Key Changes:

As a reminder, Makerbot’s Privacy Policy applies to all Makerbot owned applications.
Makerbot may collect personal data such as your name and address and non-personal data such as device information and IP address, which could be used to derive location, in order to provide better experiences and services to our users. Non-personal data may be associated to your Makerbot account to become personal data if your Makerbot account is used.
Makerbot may collect usage statistics associated with your use of our 3D Printing Ecosystem. This information may include types of actions, your IP address, and your Makerbot Account. The policies regarding this data use have been included in the end user license agreements associated with the particular applications.
Makerbot may aggregate these various pieces of information in order to inform business decisions and provider better services to Makerbot users.

Other than the above, the way that we use and disclose your personal information, and the choices you have, remain the same.

MakerBot Industries, LLC (“Company,” “us,” “our,” and/or “we“) is committed to protecting the privacy of our Users (“Users,” “you,” and/or “your”). We have prepared the MakerBot Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data (as defined below) we collect from Users of our Sites, Services, and the rest of the MakerBot Ecosystem, including but not limited to mobile apps, the MakerBot Desktop App, and MakerBot 3D printers. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meanings given in the MakerBot Terms of Use located here. By using and accessing the Sites, you consent and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into the MakerBot Terms of Use.


1. USER CONSENT. By submitting Personal Data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


2. A NOTE ABOUT CHILDREN.  We do not intentionally gather Personal Data from visitors who are under the age of 13, and neither our Site nor our Services are intended for children under this age.


3. A NOTE TO USERS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES. Your Personal Data may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of Personal Data may be less stringent than the laws in your country.


4. TYPES OF DATA WE COLLECT. “Personal Data” means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Non-Personal Data” means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Non-Personal Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Non-Personal Data as described below.

(A) Information You Provide to Us

We may collect Personal Data from you, such as your first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, professional title, company name, your industry, and password when you create a Company Account.


We retain information on your behalf, such as designs and other files and messages that you store using your Company Account.


If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail for any purpose, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well as any other content included in the e-mail, such as a product serial number.


When you participate in one or more activities through our Sites and Services or directed at our official social media handles, including, but not limited to, our surveys, contests, sweepstakes, giveaways, and educational or training classes, we may collect the additional information provided by you for such participation. You should read the separate terms and conditions that govern these activities.


When you post messages or other content on our Site, the information contained in your posting will be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it, including in commercial contexts. For example, we collect the profile name and profile photo you may post to the Sites, and actions you take on our Sites or on third-party applications connected to your Company Account through the use of our Services.


We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your operating system and version, product registration number, and other requested information if you contact us via e-mail regarding support for the Services.


We may also collect Personal Data, such as at other points in our Site that state that Personal Data is being collected.

B) Information Collected via Technology

To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, unique system/hardware identifier, a date/time stamp for your visit and/or any other unique attributes that are available to us via your use of our Sites, Services, and technology.


We also use cookies and URL information to gather information regarding your visit to our Sites, among other things we collect the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to identify you and among other things provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site and Services. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions.


Information may be aggregated and used to help us provide more useful information to our customers and to understand which parts of our website, products, and services are of most interest. Aggregated data is considered Non-Personal information for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.


We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). MakerBot may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Company Account.


We may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide MakerBot with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points, and cell towers.


We may collect and store details of how you use our services, including search queries. This information may be used to improve the relevancy of results provided by our services.


We may collect certain usage statistics (the “Usage Statistics“). The Usage Statistics may include, but are not limited to date and time of action (such as, for example, when you print a file, purchase a product or browse the Sites), type of action, any parameters associated with the type of action, your IP address, and your user Thingiverse/MakerBot ID. The Thingiverse/MakerBot ID will only be shared if you are also logged in to the Thingiverse/MakerBot website and/or relevant parts of the MakerBot Ecosystem.

(C) Information Collected from Third Party Companies.

We may receive Personal and/or Non-Personal Data about you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled website or companies that offer their products and/or services on our Site. These third party companies may supply us with Personal Data. We may add this information to the information we have already collected from you via our Site in order to improve the Services we provide.


MakerBot may use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc (“Google”) or any other analytics services. Google Analytics or other analytics services use cookies and text files, which may be stored on your computer or other device. These cookies collect anonymous traffic data and/or Personal Data that allows for an analysis of your usage of the MakerBot Ecosystem.
