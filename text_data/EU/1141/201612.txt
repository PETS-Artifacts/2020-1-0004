WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ON THE SITE AND HOW WE COLLECT IT
Active Collection of Information
      Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit the Site or use any of the products or services offered via the Site. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect your name, email address, user name, telephone number, credit card account number when you register, set up an account, contact us by e-mail or use our products or services.
    From time-to-time we may also collect personal information you provide in connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, promotional offers, and other activities on the Site.
We may also collect photos you upload to the Site, which, at your election, can only be seen by:
      (i) BeFunky and you; or (ii) any visitor to the Site.
When you use our email support services, we collect your correspondence in order to build up a public knowledge base, which will be available to all users of the Site. Your correspondence will probably not be used verbatim, but likely paraphrased in an FAQ format.

Passive Collection of Information
When you visit the Site, some information may be automatically collected. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Web site you visit including ours. Such information includes your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, access times, browser type and language, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about your computer's operating system and information about your usage and activity on the Site.

Cookies
We may automatically collect certain information through the use of "cookies." Cookies are small data files that are stored on your hard drive by a Web site. Among other things, the use of cookies helps us to improve the Site and your experience on the Site. We use cookies to see which areas and features of the Site are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing the Site, to personalize your experience and to remember your preferences. If your browser is set not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, you may not be able to access certain features or services of the Sites.

Web Beacons
Web beacons, also known as gifs, are electronic images that may be used on the Site or in our emails. A Web beacon may be used on our Web pages to collect information, deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage and campaign effectiveness and in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.
STORAGE OF INFORMATION & TRANSFER OF DATA ABROAD
Most of the information we collect is retained by us in our database, except credit card information is never stored on our servers for an extended period. Instead, credit card information is stored using a feature provided by certain of our vendors.
If you are visiting the Site from a country other than the country in which our Web servers are located (currently United States of America) the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Site and communicating electronically with us, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy.

We share information collected through the Site with companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf.

This sharing is only done for transactional purposes, and the information is not used by these parties for anything other than providing specific services to us.Also, we may disclose the personal information we collect through the Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to: (i) comply with applicable law (or a court order or subpoena); (ii) prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (iii) enforce the Terms of Service or other agreements that govern your use of the Site and/or our services; (iv) to protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others; or (v) to protect your vital interests.  Personal information submitted to the Site or collected by us is our asset and will become part of our normal business records.  Your personal information and other data collected by us may be transferred to another company that has acquired our stock or assets, for example, as a result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation.  If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company's use of your personal information will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

(i) Keep your BeFunky Image private on the Site - Users of the Site will not be able to view your BeFunky Image, but you are able to share your BeFunky Image with others.
