Ordering Online
Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer — an encryption protocol — and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall.
In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.
Bonner and Partners  does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of Bonner and Partners ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other Bonner and Partners  products that may suit your interests. And, although we may disagree with it, we must turn over pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to obtain it.
