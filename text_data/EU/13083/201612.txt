Thank you for using Quip. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that we receive when you use Quip.

We may also collect information like your gender, date of birth and zip code. If you choose to create a Quip account via a third-party service such as Google or Facebook, you may have to provide us with your username or user ID so that your identity can be authenticated.
