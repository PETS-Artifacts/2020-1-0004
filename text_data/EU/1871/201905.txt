Provision of our servicesSearching and booking of flights and related servicesThe main reason we collect and use your Personal Data is to conclude an agreement with you and then to provide you the services that you've ordered. Depending on the extent in which you use our services, we will process your Personal Data in a way that is necessary to enter into and fulfil our Service Agreement as described in Article 2 of our Terms & Conditions. The services that we provide include, primarily, the brokering of an air carriage contract and related services between you and the selected carrier. To achieve this purpose, we need to share your Personal Data with the air carriers with whom you will enter into an air carriage contract and in some cases also with the providers of the Global Distribution Network.If you order additional service Special assistance or when you ask us to get a refund due to health issues, we will process your Personal Data concerning health and in case of the Special assistance service, we will share it with the air carrier of your choice. During the ordering process, you will be asked to give your explicit consent with the processing of this Personal Data. You can always withdraw your consent through this form: kiwi.com/privacy/rights. However, please note, that if you withdraw the consent with the processing of your personal data for the purpose of the Special Assistance additional service, we won't be able to provide you with any subsequent support related to this service.Ordering other servicesIt may also happen that you choose to order another service that we or our partners offer on our website or in our app, such as insurance or accommodation. We will process your Personal Data as required to enter into a contract with you, to provide you with the ordered service or (if the service is provided by our partner) to enable you to enter into the contract with the service provider and to do our part in the contractual relationship between you and the third-party service provider. This will include the transfer of your data to this third-party service provider. You can find the complete list of third-party Data Controllers that we might share your data with here.As with the previous example, we are allowed to process your Personal Data for this purpose based on a legal ground of necessity for conclusion or performance of a contract.Customer supportCustomer support is a huge part of our services. We will record all of our communication through all channels, such as email, chat and phone calls, in order to provide you with the service that you require. Part of our customer support is also helping our customers with potential legal issues with the air carriers (in case of missed flights and similar situations). For this, we have partnered with a third-party service provider. When you have a legal problem, we will send this provider your email address and you will be contacted with an offer to help you exercise your claims. You can learn more about the sharing of your personal data with third-party data controllers here.Again, we are legally allowed to process your Personal Data for this purpose based on a necessity for the conclusion or performance of a contract. If you used our service through one of our partners' websites to order a transport ticket, we shall inform the partner about any emergency that might impact your journey, such as a natural disaster or bankruptcy of the transport provider. This is to ensure that the information reaches you as promptly as possible. That way, if you reach out to the partner with a question or complaint, they will be able to help you without having to refer you to our customer support.This transfer of Personal Data shall be carried out based on your legitimate interest.User accountIf you want to register a Kiwi.com account, we need to process your Personal Data such as your email address, password and other information necessary to provide you with this service. We are legally allowed to this based on a necessity for the conclusion or performance of a contract. Fraud preventionWhen you book a flight or order any other service through our website or app, during the payment transaction, we use a third-party service that helps us prevent fraudulent behaviour. This is a very common process that happens nearly every time you order something online. For this to be possible, we will transfer your Personal Data momentarily to a third-party Data Processor. However, this is not something to worry about, the whole transaction is completely secure, and we use one of the best and most common fraud-prevention tools. You can learn more about the Data Processors we use here. Furthermore, to prevent attempts for fraudulent chargebacks, if you report fraudulent purchase through your bank, we might check your social media to see, whether you have some sort of connection to the person who ordered the ticket to make sure that it is not an attempt to get the money for the ticket back by fraud. We shall only process limited information about your connection to the person, who ordered the ticket, and whether you by any chance havenâ€™t published some information connected to the flight (e.g. photos from the airport taking the flight).We need to prevent fraudulent behavior to protect our business and our property. This protection against fraud is one of the strongest legitimate interests recognized within the EU. Therefore, we process your personal data for this process on the legal ground of the legitimate interest.Marketing purposesSending personalized offersTo provide you with the best offers and to maximise our marketing efficiency, we process your Personal Data for the purposes of direct marketing (email offers and related processing activities). Besides your contact details, we also keep data like your transaction history, flight preferences and other data about your interaction with us that help us with customer segmentation and personalisation of these offers.
