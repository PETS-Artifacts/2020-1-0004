This is the privacy policy of Sophos Limited and its subsidiaries. 
We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of your personal data. Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we collect and use your personal data, for example when you contact us, visit one of our websites (each a “Site”), apply for a job, or use our products and services. 
Whenever you give us personal data, you are consenting to its collection and use in accordance with this privacy policy. 
What personal data do we collect?
We may collect personal data such as your name, company position, address, telephone number, mobile number, fax number, email address, credit card details, age, IP address, and account usernames. 
How do you use my personal data?
If you provide personal data to us, we will collect that information and use it for the purposes for which you have provided it and in accordance with this privacy policy.
Browsing our Site
Every time you connect to the Site, we store a log of your visit that shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the Internet - its IP address. This tells us what your machine has looked at, whether the page request was successful or not and which browser your machine used to view the pages. This data is used for statistical purposes as well as to help customize the user experience as you browse the Site and subsequently interact with Sophos and our partners. This helps us to understand which areas of the Site are of particular interest, which pages are not being requested, and how many people are visiting the Site in total. It also helps us and our partners to determine which products and services may be of specific interest to you. We may attempt to contact you through these details if necessary, including, without limitation, when you are using the wrong paths to access the Site or are breaching restrictions on the use of the Site. We may also use this information to block IP addresses where there is a breach of the Terms and Conditions for use of the Site.
Cookies
A cookie is a piece of text that gets entered into the memory of your browser by a website, allowing the website to store information on your machine and later retrieve it. Some of our pages use cookies so that we can distinguish you from other users and better serve you when you return to the Site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the onsite experience. For information about the cookies that we use, please refer to the Cookie Information page on the relevant Site.
Job applicants
