We have implemented technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your personal information. We invest significant resources to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. However, no Internet-based site can be 100% secure and we cannot be held responsible for unauthorized or unintended access that is beyond our control.Back to topProtecting your details and protecting yourself against Internet fraudHere are some simple steps you can take to ensure your information is kept securely:Keep your booking reference confidential. When you make a booking, we will provide a unique booking reference (also known as a PNR or Passenger Name Record) in the email confirmation or ticket of each person in your booking. It is important that you keep your booking reference confidential at all times. Other persons may be able to access your booking details through our system if you disclose your booking reference to them.If you are traveling in a group and would prefer that your individual booking details not be available to other passengers, you may choose to have each person make a separate booking (to be paid for individually).Keep your Skywards number, Business Rewards number, and customer login details confidential. You should not share your login details with anyone else. You should also log out when you finish using our platforms. This is especially important if you are using a publicly accessible computer.Beware of phishing, a practice in which someone tries to represent themselves as someone else in order to gain information from you. Always check whether emails from any sender are actually from them, and if in doubt, go directly to their website. Do not click on links in emails, as these may take you to "clone" websites that use your information illegally.Back to topAggregate data, data analytics, and social media functionalityWe may aggregate personal information and remove any identifying elements in order to analyze patterns and improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze platform use, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our platforms’ content, layout, products, and services, and we may appoint third parties to do this on our behalf, as set out above.We gather certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to our platforms.
