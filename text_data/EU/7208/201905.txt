Registration information
Why we hold it
We are required under legislation, including the Medical Act 1983, to maintain registers of medical practitioners. We are responsible for making sure that doctors on the registers are suitably qualified. 
We hold contact information so that we can contact doctors about their registration, annual retention fee payment and fitness to practise investigations. We also contact registered doctors with relevant news, such as new guidance.
What we hold
We hold information about doctors who are registered with us. We also hold information about doctors who apply for registration, and doctors who are no longer registered.
For registration purposes we hold information about a doctor’s nationality, qualifications, employment history, and other relevant evidence in support of their application for registration. 
We hold data about doctors’ health and criminal convictions if they have told us this information as part of their application.
When a doctor applies for registration as an international medical graduate we verify their primary medical qualification and, if appropriate, their post graduate qualification. The verification process is carried out on our behalf by an external organisation and may require data to be transferred outside the European Economic Area. We are provided with confirmation of the verification, or with information about any concerns raised through the process. 
If a doctor has undergone any Professional and Linguistic Assessments Board (PLAB) test, we will hold information about their assessment history and scores.
We hold contact information about doctors, and depending on how they pay their Annual Retention Fee we also hold bank account or credit card information. 
We hold information about fitness to practise incidents which take place while a student is at a UK medical school. This information is provided by students and universities when the student is applying for provisional registration.
How we share it
We are required to make some of this information publicly available on the medical register. Organisations can subscribe to download the medical register; these details are the same as those on the online medical register and do not contain doctors' contact details.
We share non-public registration information with relevant third parties when it is necessary to assist them with their functions or legitimate interests. Third parties include UK health departments, employers, designated bodies, responsible officers, suitable persons and other bodies where appropriate. This information includes date of birth, photograph, passport details, registered email address, registered address and whether a doctor is being investigated under our fitness to practise procedures. 
Fitness to practise investigations and sanctions information
Why we hold it
We are required under the Medical Act 1983 to investigate fitness to practise concerns.
If you raise a concern about a doctor with us, we will use the information you provide to investigate those concerns. We detail how we use this information in How we use your information when considering concerns.
The Medical Act also requires us to share information about fitness to practise investigations with employers and the Department of Health.
What we hold
We hold information about fitness to practise concerns, investigations of concerns, records of hearings, and records of the outcome of our investigations, including sanctions and warnings.
We hold information about patients, including medical records, where it has been provided as part of a complaint or is necessary for our investigation. 
We hold information about doctors’ health and criminal convictions where it is relevant to the concern that we’re considering.
We have the power to require the disclosure of medical records if necessary.
How we share it
We are required by law to share details of an investigation with the doctor concerned and their employer.
During an investigation we may disclose details of the investigation to other organisations or individuals where it is necessary for us to carry out our statutory functions.
All fitness to practise sanctions are published on a doctor’s record on the online medical register. Further information about hearings and sanctions issued by a tribunal is published on the MPTS website. You can find further information about warnings and undertakings issued by case examiners on our website. You can find more information about how we publish fitness to practise information, including relevant time periods, in our publication and disclosure policy.
We disclose tribunal hearing bundles to the Disclosure and Barring Service in line with our duties under the Safeguarding Children and Vulnerable Groups Act 2006.
We share information about recent sanctions with bodies in the UK and abroad who have a legitimate or statutory interest in this information.
Research
Why we hold it
We conduct and commission research on a range of topics to support our regulatory functions related to registration, fitness to practise, and medical education and training. We generate statistical data based on the information we hold, for example GMC Data Explorer.
We use data profiling to help us understand more about the types of doctor more likely to have fitness to practise issues. This includes using the GMC’s own data about registered doctors and fitness to practise investigations, and may also include data obtained from third parties. Profiling is not used to make automated decisions about a doctor’s registration or fitness to practise. 
What we hold
The personal data which we use to carry out our regulatory functions can also be used for research which supports those functions. This includes demographic information, employment and fitness to practise history, and details of complaints.
We obtain further data from third parties to enable research into medical education as part of the UKMED project. This data covers individuals who started at a UK medical school since 2007. The data providers include the Higher Education Statistical Authority, medical schools, Deaneries and the UK Foundation Programme Office. More information about the data we hold and how we use it us available on the UKMED website. 
How we share it
We share personal data with researchers if it is necessary to do so. We only share what is necessary for the research, using secure methods.
Where possible we provide researchers with anonymised or pseudonymised data for research purposes. UKMED research data is always pseudonymised.
When we publish research or statistics we apply disclosure controls to make sure individuals can't be identified from the data.
National training surveys
Why we hold it
The Medical Act 1983 requires us to monitor and report on the standard of medical training in the UK. The survey helps us make sure that doctors in training receive high quality training in a safe and effective clinical environment and trainers are well supported in their role. 
We also use the national training surveys to support research into medical training.
What we hold
On an annual basis we issue the national training surveys to doctors in training and their trainers. We hold the answers doctors give us about their experience of postgraduate training.
How we share it
We've published a confidentiality statement about national training surveys data that explains this in more detail.
GMC events
Why we hold it
We hold records of registration and attendance at GMC events. We hold information about registration and attendance so that we can contact attendees about their event. We also retain information so that we can verify past attendance and plan for future events. We also ask for dietary and access requirements where appropriate so that we can plan the event.
What we hold
We hold information about registrants and attendees at GMC events. This can include name, employment details, contact details, and any dietary and accessibility requirements.
Our delegate management system is operated by a third party acting under contract to the GMC, and they have access to this data where it is necessary for them to do so.
Consultations
We run consultations on a range of topics related to our regulatory functions. As part of the process we record the names and contact information of respondents, as well as their answers. 
Why we hold it
We hold this information so that we can carry out research and analysis of the responses, and keep in touch with respondents about the outcome of the consultation. We ask respondents for their email addresses so that we can confirm registration on our consultation site, contact them if they forget their password and notify them of any upcoming consultations that are in line with their interests, where they have asked us to do so.
How we share it
At the end of the consultation process, we will publish reports explaining our findings and conclusions. We won’t include any personally identifiable information in these reports, but may include illustrative quotes from consultation responses. We may also provide responses to third parties for quality assurance or to approved research projects, which are anonymised before disclosure where possible. 
Retention periods for personal data
Our records retention schedule explains how long we will keep personal data for.
