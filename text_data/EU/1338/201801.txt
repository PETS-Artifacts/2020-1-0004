Thank you for visiting FlightAware.  FlightAware is committed to honoring the privacy of our members and visitors.

What information does FlightAware receive and how do we use it?

  When you register for FlightAware and other FlightAware services, we ask you for your name,
  contact information, preferences, and personal profile information. This information lets us provide
  personalized services and communicate separately with you. We also use aggregated information about
  the use of our services to evaluate our users' preferences, improve our programming, and facilitate
  third-party reporting of Internet usage.


  Like most web sites, we use small bits of data called cookies stored on users' computers to simulate a
  continuous connection. Cookies let us remember information about your preferences and passwords and
  allow you to move within our service without reintroducing yourself. Web browsers let
  you easily see and control cookies. FlightAware and its advertisers may also use cookies to
  determine on an anonymous basis which advertisements users have seen and how users responded to them,
  but don't use such cookies to collect personally identifiable information unless you give us
  permission to do so.  Similarly, FlightAware and its advertisers may use small pieces of code
  called "web beacons" or "clear gifs" to collect anonymous advertising metrics and to deliver cookies
  related to such advertisements.

May I choose what information I disclose?

 While we need certain information to register you as a unique user and let you access personalized services,
 some contact and optional information is not required and may be given at your discretion.  Registration is
 not mandatory and you may use most FlightAware services without disclosing any information.

What if I need to review or change the personal information I previously disclosed?

 We encourage FlightAware members to update and edit their personal information and keep it current. You
 can easily correct or update your personal information at any time via our Profile page.

What kind of security is used to protect my information?

  We store all user information in secure databases protected via a variety of access controls. This data is
  accessed only for the purposes specified in this privacy statement.

What information is made to other FlightAware users?


  When contributing to the FlightAware public discussion forums, photo system, Squawks, or other community features,
  it is inherent in the form of communication that
  your unique user name is revealed to identify yourself.  All other information in your profile
  is optional, but will be displayed if you have entered such information and not specifically
  asked that it is not displayed.
 

  When interacting with other members or sending third parties a message, flight alert, notification,
  flight plan, or other details via FlightAware, your username, full name and email address may
  be distributed as part of the interaction.  Similarly, if you accept (directly or implicitly) or reply
  to an interaction, the same information may be similarly distributed.
 

Who has access to my information?

 We do not share personally identifiable data with other companies (apart from
 those acting as our agents in providing our service to you, who agree to use
 it only for that purpose), except as necessary to fulfill a transaction you
 have requested, or unless you otherwise give us permission to do so. FlightAware
 may also share such information in response to legal process, such as a court
 order or subpoena.

What about other companies featured on FlightAware?

 We will not reveal any information about you to any company featured on
 FlightAware.  However, a featured company may define user criteria that they are interested
 in and by choosing to evaluate an advertisement, the featured company will know
 that you meet the defined criteria.

What about children's information?

 Children under the age of thirteen years old may not register for FlightAware or use any FlightAware
 services that require personally identifiable information.

What about the privacy issues with tracking private aircraft?
Who can I contact if I have any questions regarding my privacy?
