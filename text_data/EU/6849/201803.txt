Review of Anonymous Data
We are committed to ensuring that our website contains content that is valuable and useful to our customers and potential customers who visit. To assist us in this, from time to time, we may implement the Google analytics demographics and interest reporting features on our website. These tools allow us to review anonymous data regarding the gender, age and interests of website visitors and adapt our website content to better reflect their needs. Although this information is collected through your Google ad settings, it is not provided to us in a personally-identifiable format. This means we cannot identify what information is about you, and we will not try to figure it out. If we do utilize this feature, you can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Google Ad settings or through the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.
ACS may also use Google and Adobe analytics data and the DoubleClick cookie to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to our website.  Site visitors may opt out of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Opt out of seeing Google personalized ads or they may opt out of Google Analytics by visiting the Google Analytics opt-out page or the Adobe Analytics opt-out page. Google has additional information available about their Remarketing Privacy Guidelines, Policies, and Restrictions.
