Website Privacy Policy
Thank you for visiting this website, which is owned and operated by Cummins Inc. This Privacy Policy contains our online privacy and security practices and describes the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.
Information We Collect
You may use our website without providing any information about yourself. However, in order to provide some of our web based services to you or to permit you to enter certain sections of our website, we require you to provide a small amount of personal information. For example, if you want to register a product, submit a question to us, inquire about our products, sign up for one of our programs, purchase items via our online store, or apply for a job at one of our offices, we must collect some personal information about you. We also provide certain sections of our sites for our suppliers, which allow them to access their Cummins account.
Occasionally, we may invite you to participate in a survey or poll such as providing feedback about our site content, services, or products. Your responses will be anonymous unless you choose to provide your contact details so that we can provide you with additional information regarding the survey.
The personal information you provide to us through our site varies, based upon the type of service you are requesting. If you choose to register for one of our programs, you always have the option of unsubscribing at any time.
Sharing Your Information
We use the information you provide to us to address your request, process your order, or respond to your questions. We may share your personal information with our subsidiaries, joint ventures, affiliates, authorized distributors and other business partners, to the extent that they are assisting Cummins in fulfilling your request or providing products or services to our customers.
Cummins does not sell or share personal information provided to us with third parties for their own separate use.
Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Information
Like most global organizations, Cummins transfers (shares) some of the personal data that it collects and processes with relevant affiliates (personnel) in other countries. In addition, as may be warranted for legitimate business activities, it may also share some of that information with approved business partners who provide services to Cummins and are located in other countries. The data privacy laws that apply to personal data differ from country to country, and do not always offer a consistent level of protection to data that is transferred out of the country of origin. Nevertheless, Cummins takes steps to ensure that the personal data which is transferred to other countries is adequately protected at all times by the recipient, regardless of the country and the data protection requirements required by law in that location. The protections include, for example, ensuring proper written agreements and surrounding awareness materials for transfers within the Cummins group as well as to external business partners. If you have questions about Cummins’ cross-border transfers or believe that your information has been mismanaged, you can email us at law.department@cummins.com, or write to us at Cummins Inc., 500 Jackson Street, Columbus, Indiana USA 47201.
Cookies and Other Anonymous Web Tracking Techniques
Like most websites, we may also collect information online through “cookies”, which are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using. Cookies can contain a variety of information, such as a simple count of how often you visit our site or information that allows customization of our site for your use. We use cookies to display information more effectively to you and to gather data about the usage of our site. You can always set your browser to refuse all cookies or to warn you when a cookie is sent to you. This will provide you with more control over the acceptance of cookies on your computer. However, it is possible that some portions of this website will not function properly or may perform more slowly if you choose to reject cookies.
Safeguarding Your Information
Cummins has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online from loss, misuse, alteration, unauthorized access, or theft. This includes appropriate safeguards for customers making purchases through our sites, as well as those who enroll in our programs.\
Our Commitment to Children's Privacy
This website is not intended to collect or maintain any information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we collected any information from anyone under the age of 13, we will purge it immediately, except for responding to a question or inquiry on a one-time basis from the individual.
Right of Access, Correction, and Objection/Consent
We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information on file with us is accurate and up-to-date. In that regard, we invite you to contact us to update your information if it changes, such as your email address, so that you can continue to receive information from us that you have requested.
Links to Other Websites
Our website may contain links to other websites that are not owned or operated by Cummins. You should carefully review the privacy policies and practices of other websites, as we cannot control and are not responsible for privacy policies or practices of third-party websites that are not ours.
Changes to This Privacy Policy
As we continue to provide additional services and as the privacy laws and regulations evolve, it may be necessary to revise or update our Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage, so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way the notification information that we have available. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
We will always use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
Contact Us
If you have questions about Cummins’ Safe Harbor Privacy Procedures or practices or believe that your information has been mismanaged, you can contact us by emailing us at law.department@cummins.com, or writing to us at Cummins Inc. Global Headquarters, 500 Jackson Street, Columbus, IN 47201.

Updated February 2017
Cookies Website Notice and Disclosure Statement
This Website Notice and Disclosure Statement applies to websites that are owned or operated by Cummins Inc. as well as its subsidiaries, joint ventures, affiliates, and any authorized distributors. It is intended to inform you about Cummins’ use of cookies, analytics and other web technologies on its websites, as well as your options for rejecting the use of those items.
 What are cookies?
Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on a user's web browser. When the user browses the same website in the future, the cookie notifies the website of the user's previous activity. Cookies do not harm your computer in any way, and some are automatically deleted after a certain period of time, such as six months.
 Does Cummins use cookies on its websites?
Yes. Like virtually all websites, we use certain types of cookies on our sites. This allows us to collect non-personal information through a variety of technologies. This helps us identify visitors who return to our site and tells us such things as how many users visited our site, the pages that were accessed, and whether there were any technical problems in loading pages or navigating through our site. By collecting this information, we learn what parts of our sites are the most interesting or valuable to our users, and can monitor overall interest in our websites. It also lets us spot technical problems with our site so we can correct them right away. This, in turn, helps us upgrade our websites and improve our offerings for our visitors.
 Am I required to accept cookies to use the Cummins websites?
No. You can disable the use of cookies by websites including ours by turning off the cookie function on your browser. However, some portions of our site as well as most other sites, will not work properly if you choose to do so. For example, if you choose to purchase something through our site or put in a password to access a restricted area, you will not be able to do so unless the site can authenticate you through cookies.
 What information do you receive about me through cookies?
There are four general categories of cookies that are used on websites:
Strictly necessary (or essential) cookies.These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as services you have asked for. Without these cookies, those services would not be available to you. This includes, for example, browsing as a registered user, accessing secure areas of the site, or making a purchase through the site. Like all public websites, our site uses strictly necessary cookies.
Performance cookies. These cookies collect information about how visitors use a website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the website works. Like virtually all websites, we use performance cookies on our sites.
Functionality cookies. These cookies allow the website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. This allows you to have a better experience while using the site. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Like virtually all websites, we use functionality cookies on our sites.
Targeting or advertising cookies. These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with the website operator’s permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization. Cummins does not use advertising cookies on its websites and does not allow third parties to use those types of cookies on its sites.
 What happens if I choose not to disable cookies on my computer?
Unless you disable such technologies, by using our website and online services, you agree that we can place these types of cookies and related technologies on your device.
 What are web beacons?
Some types of cookies collect aggregate information which helps us to improve our websites by providing information, for example, on loading errors and the most visited webpages. Certain pages on our site may contain web beacons (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags and clear GIFs). We uses web beacons to help display content to visitors and to generate statistics regarding web traffic and trends. Web beacons cannot identify you as an individual.
 What are advertising cookies?
Advertising cookies are cookies that target an individual to purchase certain items based upon their web browsing practices. For example, if you browse golf clubs on the web, and if the websites that you use (or the search engine) has installed advertising cookies, you may see pop-up ads for other sites that sell golf products or have content relating to golf. Cummins does not use advertising cookies on its websites and does not allow third parties to use those types of cookies on its sites.
 How do I opt-out (withdraw consent) to your use of cookies or similar web technologies?
You may opt out of our use of cookies as follows: 
You can set your web browser to prevent the use of cookies. If so, you can still browse our site but may not be able to use many of its features or make purchases.
 Does Cummins permit third parties to install cookies or similar web technologies on its websites?
As a general rule, we do not permit any third parties (such as advertisers) to install cookies on our websites or engage in behavioral advertising. However, on some of our websites, such as our social networking pages, it is possible that individuals have uploaded third party content, such as videos from YouTube or elsewhere, or embedded content and sharing tools from other third party sites. Since we do not control the dissemination of cookies by any sites that are not owned or operated by Cummins, you should check the relevant third party website(s) for more information about these cookies, and whether and how you may opt out of receiving them. Generally speaking, however, you may disable third party cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Instructions may be found at www.aboutcookies.org.
