Protection of personal information

3. Restrict access to user personal information;

Although in all cases reasonable and effective measures have been taken, and have to comply with the relevant standards required by law and pngtree, there is still no guarantee on your personal information security through unsafe communications. Therefore, users should take active measures to ensure their own personal information security, such as regularly changing passwords of their accounts and not disclosing personal information such as their account passwords to others.
You know that the personal information protection provided by pngtree is only available on the pngtree platform. Once you leave pngtree, browser or use other platforms, services or content resources, pngtree has no ability and obligation to protect any personal information you submit on the pngtree platform, whether you are logged in or browsing the above platforms based on pngtree links or guides.

Access to personal information

After you complete your pngtree account application, you can view or modify the personal information you submitted to pngtree. In general, you can browse at any time, modify your submitted information, but for reasons regarding security and identity, you may not be able to modify the initial information and authentication information when you first apply for pngtree’s services.
        

Use of cookies and web beacons

Cookies can help the platform identify users and count the number of users, which are often used by platforms to determine whether the user who has completed the application has logged in. Pngtree promises that research on Cookie information will only be used to improve service/product quality and optimize user experience. If you do not want your personal information to be kept in cookies, you can configure the browser by selecting "reject cookies" or "notify you when the platform sends cookies". Since pngtree's service is implemented by supporting cookies, after you completely shut down the cookie, it may affect your access to pngtree or the pngtree service. When you do not disable cookies, you may be prompted to retain user information the next time you enter the platform through a simplified login (such as automatic login). The method and purpose of pngtree using web beacons are the same as cookies.

Modification of the privacy protection policy

Pngtree shall have the right to modify any provision of the "privacy policy" at any time. Once the content of the privacy policy changes, pngtree will announce its modifications to the “privacy policy” on the pngtree platform. This publishing behavior is considered to be a notification by pngtree to you to modify your content. Pngtree can also prompt users to modify content in other appropriate ways. If you do not agree with pngtree's changes to the terms of this privacy policy, you have the right to stop using pngtree’s services. If you continue to use the pngtree’s services, you will be deemed to have received changes made by pngtree to the terms of this agreement.
