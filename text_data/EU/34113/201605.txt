Information Collection
OSA is the sole owner of the information collected on www.osa.org and affiliated sites. OSA collects information at several different points on the Web site.
Periodically, a user must complete a registration form to register for OSA events. During registration a user is required to give contact information. This information is used to contact the user about the event for which the user has registered or related events, services and products. The attendee lists for OSA Topical Meetings are made available to attendees for networking purposes.
Authors and reviewers may provide personal information in the process of submitting a manuscript or review, or when establishing reviewer expertise profiles.  We do not distribute personally identifiable information except as is consistent with the scholarly publishing peer-review process (e.g., for the purpose of introducing your submission to an editorial review board).
While placing an order, a user is asked to provide contact information and financial information. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer's order. If there is a problem processing an order, the information may be used to contact the user.
Information is collected through cookies, log files, link tracking, and/or third parties. Some of the collected information is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user.
Cookies
OSA may use cookies to record session information such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart.
Database Confidentiality
OSA does not sell or share email addresses with other organizations without the express permission of the user. OSA does not sell contact information from the database to non-corporate members.
Contact information for OSA members is automatically included in the directory of members, which is available to members, unless an OSA member has opted out.
Log Files
Web site log files are used to store information such as: internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement within the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. The log files are used by utility tracking software to analyze user movement.
Database download logs track which articles have been downloaded by which IP (for institutional subscriptions) or individual (for individual subscriptions). If downloads exceed a standard level, the individual or institution will receive a warning and service may be disconnected.  This action is taken to ensure that the systems remain available to all subscribers.  Individuals have access to a report that details the articles they have downloaded.  Institutions have access to a report that details the articles downloaded by IP addresses at their institution.
Email tracking
Link tracking is used within HTML-based emails to track which links have been clicked by the recipients. This tracking provides a means to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
Use of Google Universal Analytics
OSA uses "Google Analytics", including its "Universal Analytics," to collect information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. OSA uses the information it gets from Google Analytics only to improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying information.

Google Analytics uses cookies to define user sessions, which allows for the collection of data about how visitors are using the websites.
