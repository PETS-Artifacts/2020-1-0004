On various areas of the respondi website, for example on the contact form, you will be asked to provide personal information. This information is used solely to process your query or to send you the newsletter. respondi guarantees that it will not pass your details on to third parties.
In order to continually improve our services to you, we use programmes that enable us to analyse website use. Among other things, your IP address is logged and – depending on the settings of your browser – a cookie is stored on your computer.
The respondi website uses Piwik, a Web analysis service. Piwik uses “cookies”. These are tiny text files which are stored on your computer and enable us to analyse how you use our website. For this purpose,  the user information generated by the cookie (including your shortened IP address) is transferred to our server and saved for user analysis purposes, which allows us to optimize our website. During this process, your IP address is immediately anonymised. The information about your use of a particular website which is collected with the cookie, will never be passed on to a third party.
You may prevent the installation of cookies on your computer by altering the settings in your browser software. We would point out to you, however, that if you do so, you will be unable to use all of the services on this website in their entirety.
