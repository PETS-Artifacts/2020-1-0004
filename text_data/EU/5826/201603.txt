We collect information about you when you:

Register with and buy products or services on the Website.
Take part in promotions, competitions, customer surveys and questionnaires.

2. Using your information
Collecting your personal information helps us and the Tesco Group to better understand what you need from us. We collect and use your information to:
•    manage and improve the Website
•    personalise our services to you
•    administer and operate your account
•    process your orders and allocate Clubcard points to your account
•    tell you about important changes to the Website and our services
•    understand your shopping behaviour to develop and improve our products and services
•    manage promotions, competitions, customer surveys and questionnaires
•    check and verify your identity, and prevent or detect crime.
In performing verification and identity checks, your information may be disclosed to credit reference agencies, who may keep a record of that information. This is not a credit check and your credit rating will be unaffected.

We may share your personal information across the Tesco Group so they can provide you with relevant products and services.
Your personal information is safe with us and will never be released to companies outside the Tesco Group for their marketing purposes.
We may use and share anonymised information outside the Tesco Group. However, we would like to reassure you that this never includes your personal information.

3. Clubcard information
We access the information recorded through the use of your Clubcard to help us improve our service to you and to make our communications more relevant.

4. Marketing and research
If you agree, we may contact you:

with offers and information about Tesco products or services
with offers and information about partners’ products or services
for customer research to help improve our services

Of course, the choice is entirely yours, but if you say you do not want to receive marketing information from us this will prevent you from receiving great offers or promotions that may be of interest to you.
When you register online you can access a "Self Care" page that allows you to tailor our commercial communications to your preferences.
To change your contact preferences simply click "Your Account" in the top frame and click "Your Contact Preferences". If you do not want to receive commercial communications from us, select your choices by using the boxes available on that page.
We like to hear your views to help us improve our service. From time to time, we may contact you to ask your opinions. Again, if you do not want to be contacted for this purpose, make your choice on the "Contact Preferences" page.

5. Cookies
We use a system of classifying the different types of cookies which we use on the Website, or which may be dropped by third parties through our websites. The classification was developed by the International Chamber of Commerce UK and explains more about which cookies we use, why we use them, and the functionality you will lose if you decide you don't want to have them on your device. Please be reassured that we are working on other privacy and cookie-related improvements to the Website.

6. What is a cookie?
Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user’s device.
Persistent cookies - these cookies remain on a user’s device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie.
Session cookies - these cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu.

8. Strictly necessary cookies
These cookies enable services you have specifically asked for. For those types of cookies that are strictly necessary, no consent is required.
These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.

9. Performance cookies
These cookies collect anonymous information on the pages visited. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.
These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Website works.

10. Functionality cookies
These cookies remember choices you make to improve your experience. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device.
These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.

11. Targeting or advertising cookies
These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.
These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation.

12. Behavioural advertising and online privacy
A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet advertising industry which can be found at www.youronlinechoices.eu. The guide contains an explanation of the IAB’s self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control of the advertising you see.

13. Using browser settings to manage cookies
The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer.
However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website’s essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. For example, if you block or otherwise reject cookies you will not be able to add items to your Shopping Basket, proceed to Checkout, or use any of our products and services that require you to Sign in. If you leave cookies turned on, remember to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

14. Disclosing your information
We will never disclose your information to anyone outside the Tesco Group except where we have your consent; where we are required or permitted to do so by law; to other companies who provide a service to us; or any successors in title to our business.  Your information will never be released to companies outside the Tesco Group for their marketing purposes.
Whenever we transfer personal information to countries outside the European Economic Area we will ensure that appropriate security measures are taken.

15. Credit Reference agencies
We will search your record at credit reference agencies who will supply us with credit information, as well as information from the Electoral Register, about you. We will also add to your record with the credit reference agency details of your credit agreement with us, the payments you make under it and any default or failure to keep to its terms. The credit reference agency will record details of our search, whether or not your application proceeds. We may use credit scoring or other automated decision-making systems when assessing your application and to verify your identity. Credit searches and other information which is provided to us and/or the credit reference agencies, about you and those with whom you are linked financially may be used by us and other companies to make other credit decisions about you, or other members of your household. This information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering as well as the management of your account. Information held about you by the credit reference agencies may already be linked to records relating to one or more of your partners and you may be treated as financially linked, which means your application will be assessed with reference to any associated records.  Prior to such an assessment you will first need to get your partner’s consent before their information is disclosed.

16. Fraud Prevention agencies
If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified or suspected, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example, when: checking applications for, and managing credit and credit related or other facilities; recovering debt; checking insurance proposals and claims; checking details of job applicants and employees. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies.

17. Data retention
