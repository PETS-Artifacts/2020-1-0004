Why we collect
We collect data for various reasons, such as:

to provide you with software, service or information, data may identify you as an individual or company, and
            is required to provide you with the software, support, and services that you have requested. To receive the
            software, support and services, you explicitly fill in the data, whether as you purchase downloadable
            software, purchase software as a service, use our support forums, sign up for a JetBrains Account, register
            for a webinar, participate in a survey, and/or subscribe to receive marketing and/or technical information
            and content.
to check for license validation and updates, some downloadable software products regularly check for
            software updates and/or license validation.
to improve our offerings based on usage, we collect anonymous data based on the usage of our products and
            services. We use this information to better understand usage patterns of our products and behavior of our
            collective audience. At times we share this information in aggregated and always anonymous form, with the
            public or third-parties. Anonymous data collection is opt-in on downloadable products.
to promote and market our products, we may use feedback that you provide voluntarily on our products or
            services. We may use this in the form of quotes or in other ways in accordance to the JetBrains' Terms of
            Use.
to provide technical support, we may need to ask you for information to process your support request,
            especially if it requires accessing your data. We may have to access and/or request a failure code, which
            may contain personal data of the user who reported the failure. You hereby expressly consent the collection
            and storage of this data. The information will be stored only during the process of fixing the problem and
            will be deleted immediately afterwards.

What we collect
What we collect depends largely on the interaction that takes place between you and JetBrains, most of which
            can be categorized under the following:
Purchasing JetBrains Software Products
When you purchase downloadable software or sign up for software as a service, we collect information to
            process your payment and create your customer account. This information includes name, email address,
            physical address, telephone number, and company name where applicable. We do not store your complete credit
            card details. All transactions and credit card information are handled by a third party that processes all
            electronic transactions. These are governed by their agreements, which can be found on Jetbrains.com under
            the section Third-Party Services. We retain the last four digits of your credit card number and its expiry
            date so you may identify that card used, for your convenience in future purchases.
Using JetBrains Downloadable Software
When downloading and installing purchased software, you need to provide the software with identifiable
            information such as your JetBrains Account or Licensing information which may include name, email and
            license key. On installation and execution, the software may send information which includes version,
            edition, operating system information and environment it is installed in (this is applicable to tools such
            as ReSharper ™ , which is a plugin to Visual Studio ™). A unique, randomly-generated ID, which does not
            contain any license or other personally identifiable information, is also used to distinguish instances. The
            software can also check for available updates, as well as available updates for plugins or components. In
            addition it can check for license validation, either using the license key or your JetBrains Account
            details. Some software products can also use license information to inform you of the availability of
            applicable updates.
When you opt in to anonymous data collection, the software will electronically send information to JetBrains
            related to your usage patterns of the application's features. This may include but not limited to,
            information such as frameworks, file templates being used in the IDEs, actions invoked, and other
            interactions with product features. This information will contain neither source code nor personally
            identifiable information, nor information about your JetBrains Account or Licensing information.

            transactions. These are governed by their agreements, which can be found on Jetbrains.com under the section
