    The term PAYBACKFX or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the website
    whose. The term "you" refers to the user or viewer of our website.

    The use of this website is subject to the following terms of use: 




            All performance claims found on PAYBACKFX about trading systems or
            strategies must be regarded as hypothetical. Use of PAYBACKFX to
            offer or subscribe to a trading system or strategy indicates you
            agree to our Terms and Conditions. Before using any systems or
            strategies
            listed on PAYBACKFX you
            should be aware that there is often a vast difference between
            hypothetical results and real-life trading results achievable in a
            real brokerage account, and real-live results are almost always
            vastly worse than hypothetical results. Performance results for
            systems and strategies
            listed on
            PAYBACKFX do not take into account fees, spreads and/or trading
            commissions that may be charged by your broker or a money manager.
            Please consult with your broker for information on these costs.
            Additional information on how PAYBACKFX calculates performance data
            can be
            found on the PAYBACKFX FAQ page.
        

            HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS,
            SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE
            THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES
            SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP
            DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
            HYPOTHETICAL
            PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY
            ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF
            HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED
            WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING
            DOES NOT INVOLVE
            FINANCIAL RISK,
            AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE
            IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY
            TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN
            SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY
            AFFECT
            ACTUAL TRADING
            RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN
            GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM
            WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF
            HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY
            AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING
            RESULTS.

            participants may
            offer investment advice or opinions and/or effect a transaction
            which may be subsequently copied by another trader, such advice,
            opinions, or trades amount to nothing more than exchanges between
            persons who may be anonymous or unidentifiable or simply the
            execution of a trade by
            such
            traders. PAYBACKFX does not provide investment advice directly,
            indirectly, implicitly, or in any manner whatsoever by making such

            proportional amounts and with the same leverage, to the maximum
            extent possible. All such positions will be closed automatically if
            and when closed by the copied trader for whatsoever reason, without
            providing any
            further notice
            and without any action on your part and/or if the copied trader
            positions were closed manually by the follower.
            (e) You may achieve a materially different result than the PAYBACKFX
            system that you followed, especially if you place additional trades
            in your account or you modify or cancel an order generated by the
            PAYBACKFXr system.
