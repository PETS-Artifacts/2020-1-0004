Is my personal information displayed anywhere on GRAPHISOFT’s websites or applications?
There are several places on GRAPHISOFT’s websites and applications that allow you to post comments, upload pictures, or submit content for others to see.

Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you wouldn’t want publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control who sees your post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.
To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please  .
Is my personal information secure?

Where does GRAPHISOFT store my personal information?
Your personal information and data files are stored on GRAPHISOFT’s servers and the servers of companies we hire to provide services to us. Your personal information may be transferred across national borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located in different countries around the world (for example, Germany, Ireland, the United States).
