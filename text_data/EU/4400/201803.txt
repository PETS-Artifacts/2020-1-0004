Collection of Data
		We may collect personal contact information from you, including your name, e-mail, bank account/ credit card/ PayPal information, address, reputation score. If you sell 3D models on CGTrader, we may request information that is required for tax institutions of Republic of Lithuania â€“ including passport or governmental ID copies, physical address, date of birth, and identification number, which are used solely to comply with tax authorities of Republic of Lithuania when making payouts to you. You may access this information in your 
	Payment Agreement section or request to have this information modified or removed from our systems at any time by contacting us at info@cgtrader.com. In case of a user's request to changing or removing this information, CGTrader commits to responding and/or proceeding this request in 3 working days. We only use this information to carry out the immediate activity requested and for no other purpose. No information or user data is kept longer than 5 years - all the information is automatically deleted after the time validation from the last login date expires.  We do not carry out any personal research nor do we disclose this data to any persons outside of CGTrader and its immediate staff and partners.Cookies
		CGTrader does not use cookies to extract information from you, solely to simplify your visits - we use this in order to enable you to come back to CGTrader without having to login each and every time, as well as when you create a Member Account, and using external analytics services, such as Google Analytics, Intercom.io, and others. Your continued use of CGTrader means that you consent to such use of the cookies by CGTrader. When you create a Member Account, CGTrader will use cookies to store your Member ID. This Member ID is a string of random characters and contains none of your personal information. A temporary cookie is also used to keep track of your "session". Without that temporary cookie (which is not stored after you quit your browser) you would have had to log on again on each page as well as use site's functions like shopping cart, item likes and similar ones. You can turn off cookies in your web browser (more information about this is available at 
	 http://www.aboutcookies.org/).  This will however make it more or less impossible to access many of the functions on our web site.
