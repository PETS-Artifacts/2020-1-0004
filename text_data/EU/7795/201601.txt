Privacy PolicyWe are very protective over your privacy and confidentiality. We understand that all customers and prospective customers are quite rightly concerned to know that their data will not be used for any purpose unintended by them, and will not fall into the hands of a third party. Our policy is both specific & strict. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we fail to abide by our policy, please let us know. We are registered with the Data protection agency for your added peace of mind.\r\n \r\nWe do NOT hold your emails lists online or on our servers. So data provided by you is unlikely to be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers.\r\n \r\nGenerally, we collect only your email address and contact details. We do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information and we don’t sell or rent Customer Data, Customer Recipient Data or Site Visitor Data without advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law.\r\n \r\nAlthough most of our customers are businesses, some of the account information submitted to us, and maintained by us, could be used to identify or relate to an individual ("personal data") rather than a business.\r\n \r\nWhat we do with the data submitted to our site?\r\nIf you have provided your contact information (which may include personal data) to us, we may contact you for marketing purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. When you submit a quote on line or contact us regarding our services, you expressly consent to receive marketing communications about Vehicle Leasing services via direct mail, email (at the email address you provided when activating your account), telephone (at the number you provided when contacting us), text messages (if you provided a mobile telephone number), instant messages or other communication methods. We may also use personal and non-personal (e.g., business-related) data for other purposes, including but not limited to: 1) providing the services you request; and 2) providing technical support.\r\n \r\nWhy do you receive an email from us?\r\nIf you have received one or more emails from us, it means that \r\n(a)   your email address is on our list of customers or prospective customers, \r\n(b)   you have provided us your email address or one of our subsidiary companies with your email address so that we could contact you, and/or \r\n(c)   you have an existing business relationship with one of our customers and have expressly shared your email address with such customer for the purpose of receiving emails about such customer\'s products or services (in other words, you have "opted-in"). \r\n \r\nIt is possible that our customers may use our services to send unsolicited email, however. If this occurs, please contact us immediately at abuse@selectcontracts.co.uk
