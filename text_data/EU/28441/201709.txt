EarthCam - Privacy Policy
EarthCam's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. EarthCam takes your privacy concerns
seriously and firmly supports protecting your privacy online. EarthCam will never deliberately reveal private
information about our users to any third party without first receiving that user's consent. EarthCam will not
sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Please read through this policy statement to
understand our practices regarding privacy and learn how we use the information collected from you. The
following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website.


Information Gathering
There are instances where EarthCam asks for personal information, such as name and email address, to authenticate
users and to send notifications to those users relating to EarthCam. We do this when you submit a camera site
to EarthCam, sign up for EarthCam's free newsletter, sign up for EarthCam's services, post an image to the Hall of Fame, post an image to Facebook or Twitter, and send postcards or
whenever you enter an EarthCam sweepstakes or other EarthCam promotion. The user's contact information is used
to allow the user to utilize EarthCam features; contact the user when necessary; and advise them about new services, products and/or software upgrades.
The user's Facebook and Twitter account information will only be utilized to post an image or video to the user's account as requested by the user.
Users
may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. If EarthCam intends to disclose
personal information in some restricted situation, this is specifically explained to you when we collect the
information in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.


EarthCam also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate
user data, and browser type, from users and visitors to the site. This data is used to manage the website, track
usage, and improve the website services. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third
parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements. User IP addresses are recorded for security and
monitoring purposes.


Unique identifiers are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. Demographic and profile data
is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the user's experience at our site and in displaying
the content according to their preferences.


EarthCam shares information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third
parties. We refer to our users as an entirety, not as individuals. For example, we will compare EarthCam's
audience of females vs. males with the use of variables such as x and y.

Security
EarthCam member accounts are secured by member-created passwords. EarthCam takes precautions to insure that member
account information is kept private. We use reasonable measures to protect member information that is stored within 
our database and we restrict access to member information to those employees who need access to perform their job
functions, such as our customer service personnel and technical staff. Please note that we cannot guarantee the
security of member account information.


Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of member
information at any time.


Sharing and Disclosure of Information
Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, EarthCam will not disclose personal information to any

subpoena, search warrant or other legal process received by EarthCam, whether or not a response is required by
applicable law; (2) to enforce the EarthCam Terms of Service or to protect our rights; or (3) to protect the safety
of members of the public and users of the service. EarthCam reserves the right to transfer personal information to
