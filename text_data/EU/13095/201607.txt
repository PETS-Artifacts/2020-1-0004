By using this website, you consent to the practices described in this privacy notice.
RLUK is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in any manner other than that which is disclosed in this policy. Please note that RLUK does collect certain information from our users at several different points on our website. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or other parts to our web site, we can be reached via email at info@renlearn.co.uk or you can call on Freecall 0800 917 4447.

Personal Information
As noted above, certain areas of our web site may collect personally identifiable information. The information collected usually consists of an individual’s name, address, telephone number, email address and school information. This information is required only when;

an individual wishes to pursue a business relationship with RLUK such as receiving product information; or 
purchasing products from our online store. 

This information is collected, and stored in a secure, password-protected database that RLUK keeps separate from its corporate web site. RLUK will not disclose this personal information to any unrelated third party except where we are required by law, to process the purchase of an item or when a third party is helping us pursue the business relationship initiated by the individual when the individual provided the personal information. Personally identifiable information does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual (See Non Personal Information below).
The personal information that you provide to us will be used to:

process your purchase of an item from our website;
contact you in relation to your query; or 
contact you for promotional purposes. This form of communication is dealt with in the Communication section below.

This is not an exhaustive list. If your personal identifiable information changes, you may correct that information by sending an email message to info@renlearn.co.uk and putting the word UPDATE in the subject line of the message. Conversely, if you do not want to be contacted by us any longer, please email info@renlearn.co.uk or contact us on 0800 917 4447.
Communication
From time-to-time RLUK sends out promotional and informational communications relying on the personal identifiable information it has collected. You will have the option of indicating your desire to receive or not receive this type of communication at the time of your provision of such information to RLUK.

This information is only used to provide aggregate statistical information to help us keep the site functional and responsive, and to determine overall visitor usage patterns. This information is not utilised to try and identify specific individuals, or track an individual’s navigation through the site. Our web site does use “cookie” information to help provide an enhanced functional system experience to those visiting the site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user.
