	Timeline Update!
 


	Please note that the following is out of character knowledge. 
	Time progresses at a different rate in the game than in our characters' real lives. As of November 6, 2017 (OOC real time), characters should have the perception that 2 years have passed since the game's launch. This will continue to roughly mirror the passage of real time until the game's completion. The note that the perception of time is different in-game is to allow the idea that a set amount of time has passed in the real world (likely 2 years) upon the game's completion, regardless of how long it takes for the site to clear all 100 floors.
 


	We hope to release more changes soon that will streamline boss fights and floor clearing, as well as help new players establish themselves despite the time gap, but hopefully this timeline serves as a helpful tool for players throughout the rest of our time spent clearing the game.
 


	Site Changes:
 



		A post count feature has been added to the site. The number of each post (i.e. #1) now displays on the top-right, beside the "Link Post" feature.
	 


	General Rule Changes:
 



		Word count requirement for posts in which a player is stunned or paralyzed has been reduced to 100 from 150.
	 
	
		PvP and Player Killing Rules have been updated:
		

				No player can kill another without OOC permission.
			 
			
				The rule for initiative rolls on Unauthorized Combat have been removed.
			 
			
				The NPC Guard mechanic has been removed.
			 
		
 
	
		Characters Level 5 and under are eligible to claim a New Character Bundle, regardless of when their journal was created.
	 
	
		Unidentified items, when obtained in a thread, no longer have to be declared until they are identified by a Merchant. For example, a weapon drop can be claimed from a locked thread as an Unidentified T1 Weapon, rather than an Unidentified T1 2H Assault Spear. When identifying an item, the Merchant should then specify the item type in their roll(s). To clarify, items leaving locked threads should be specified according to the loot tables as: Weapon, Shield, Armor, Consumable.
	 
	
		The Loot Table has been slightly adjusted, mainly to increase the number of consumables dropped from monsters.
	 


	Crafting Changes: A note to all crafters: Be sure you are transferring your materials (col for Merchants) to the @Banker account when crafting.
 



		The <<Earning a Living>> quest has been updated, and is now profession-specific.
	 
	
		Three new crafting/gathering-based quests have been added: <<Nature's Treasure>>, <<Witch of the West>>, and <<Challenge of Olympus>>.
	 
	
		+CD bonuses for crafting have been reintroduced. These can be obtained through the new quests <<Challenge of Olympus>> & <<Witch of the West>>.

		Alchemists/Cooks:
		

				Enhancement lists for both professions have been reworked.
