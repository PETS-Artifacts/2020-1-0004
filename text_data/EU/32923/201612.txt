							It has been staff's best intentions to try and get the 3.0 update to coincide with the unlocking of the 20th floor, but due to the holidays, staff changes, and us wanting to hold it back until it's ready, we will be making a small update.
 


	1) There have been changes to appraisals, and merchants. Please re-read the relevant sections of those guides and come to a GM with any questions.
 


	2) As you may have noticed, we have Tiers 1, 2, and 3 in your profile. We will reintroduce the col and mat tracking system with 3.0, so please keep track of your current values, as staff will ask you for these when you want to have your value updated.
 


	3) Demonic items are no longer tier scaling. We will change these to legendary items, which have the benefit of having 4 slots, making them better than perfect items. The final term may change with 3.0, but the important part here is that Tier 2 demonic items will not become Tier 3 items. This does not have a place in lore or canon, and it has a negative effect on both our crafters and on an economy that we're trying to build. The items themselves do not change in any other way. If there is a demonic items you love and want to carry with you, there will be events during the year (like the current Christmas event) that may let you tier up items.
 


	4) Please remember that the way floors are explored going forward has changed, and refer to the December update for more information on how to proceed.
