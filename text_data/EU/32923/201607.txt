							It has been brought to the staff's attention that the foci of this site has and always will be Sword Art Online. The SAO side of this site has the full attention of the GM and PST team's respectively. The ALO and GGO side of this site has received off and on attention by the community and lacks any real leadership to direct and push it forward. It has come to the staff's attention to split the ALO / GGO parts of SAO-RPG off and shift them exclusively for The World Seed, our test development site that's always ran in the background of this site. That being said, by the end of this week the ALO and GGO sections will be purged entirely from SAO-RPG and you can continue to pick up said stories over on The World Seed. With that, a new separate staff will be needed to manage and navigate the ALO/GGO stories on The World Seed, so keep your eyes open for when the time comes and thank you for your understanding.
