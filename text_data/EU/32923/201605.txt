							After some discussion and thought, i am implementing some balancing changes.
 


	1. Have the damage return on Vengeful Riposte reduced to a 1/4. Possibility of high damage (despite mitigateable) along with the added 1/2 reduction received could be a bit much.
 


	2. Increase max damage on rapier strongest SA to 14x. Also the Rank 5 SAs on Wild Dance have been buffed a smidge. The SA's will receive a bigger overview at a later date.
 


	3. Increase activation rate of Recovery enhancement to CD 6 or higher to align with Regen.
 


	4. Increasing power of Electrolytes to regenerating 3 energy per slot used.
 


	5. The consumption of consumables also requires the level per tier like equipment. Crystals are the only item (aside from obvious such as banners or otherwise explicitly mentioned) which can be used on others by post effect, where the person receiving the buff does not need to meet the requirements. All other types of consumables will need to be traded to them to equip.
 


	The energy recovery skill shown in support was considered, but in the end I don't want to trivialise the energy system and I feel it would make inherently the energy hungry weapons more favourable. More rounded weapons such as OHSS and spear would become less attractive. To take the time to eat food and recover I feel is a good thing as repercussion for burning energy quickly instead of pacing out attacks.
