pCloud values your privacy.  We have prepared this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, use, protect, and disclose information and data when you use the pCloud website located at http://www.pcloud.com and any pCloud mobile applications ("Site") or pCloud services ("Services").


This Privacy Policy also explains your choices for managing your information preferences, including opting out of certain uses of your Personal Information (as defined below). By using the Site or Services you consent to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The Site is operated by pCloud AG, Switzerland (hereinafter referred to as "pCloud", "we", "us" and "our"). For the purposes of applicable European Union data protection legislation, we are the data controller.

Managing Your Information Preferences

Personal Information  We collect information that personally identifies you, such as your e-mail and other personally identifiable information that you choose to provide us with or that you choose to include in your pCloud profile or account ("Personal Information"). You may be asked to provide us with Personal Information when you register with the Site or use any of our Services, and at other times. The decision to provide this information is optional. However, if you choose not to provide the requested information, you may not be able to use some or all of the features of the Site or Services. We may also receive additional Personal Information, such as your name, address, and payment information, from Service Providers, like our payment processors.


Usage Data and Site Activity  We automatically collect information regarding the actions you take on the Site ("Usage Data"). For example, each time you use the Site we automatically collect the type of web browser you use, your operating system, your Internet Service Provider, your IP address, the pages you view, and the time and duration of your visits to the Site. We use this information to help us understand how people use the Site and Services and to enhance the services we offer. On its own, Usage data does not constitute Personal Information as it does not allow direct association with any specific individual. We reserve the right to disclose this aggregated, non-personal information to third parties for any purpose upon our sole discretion. Such third parties include but are not limited to strategic partners, subcontractors, etc.


 Cookies   We use cookies (a small text file placed on your computer to identify your computer and browser) on the Site. We use cookies to improve the experience of the Site and Services, such as pre-populating your username for easier login and preserving your user session. We do not use cookies to collect Personal Information. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, certain features of the Site or Services may not work if you delete or disable cookies.

Some of our Service Providers may use their own cookies in connection with the services they perform on our behalf.

How We Use Information and When We May Share and Disclose Information Generally

We use Personal Information for internal purposes only, such as to provide you with the Site and Services and to improve the Site and Services. We also use Personal Information to notify you of new products or Services and to otherwise communicate with you about pCloud. We may use your email address for marketing purposes, by sending you newsletters or other email communication. If you have any objections about being contacted for marketing purposes, you need to notify us in writing or unsubscribe from our written communication. We will not disclose Personal Information to third parties, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.

Profile Information You Make Available to Others

By using the Site or the Services you may make certain of your Personal Information available to others. For example, your email address will be visible when you share a file or a folder with another user of the Site or Services. You should therefore ensure that any person who you share a file or folder with is someone who you are happy to share your email address with.

Service Providers

From time to time, we may establish a business relationship with other businesses who we believe trustworthy, and who have confirmed that their privacy practices are consistent with ours ("Service Providers"). For example, we may contract with Service Providers to provide certain services, such as hosting and maintenance, data storage and management, processing of transactions and marketing and promotions. We only provide our Service Providers with the information necessary for them to perform these services on our behalf. Each Service Provider must agree to use reasonable security procedures and practices, appropriate to the nature of the information involved, in order to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Service Providers are prohibited from using Personal Information other than as specified by pCloud.

Other Transfers

We may share Personal Information and Usage Data with businesses controlling, controlled by or under common control with pCloud. If pCloud is merged, acquired or sold or in the event of a transfer of some or all of our assets, we may disclose or transfer Personal Information and Usage Data in connection with such transaction. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if, in our discretion, the new entity plans to handle your information in a way that differs materially from this Privacy Policy.

Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement

pCloud cooperates with government and law enforcement officials (and private parties, outside of the European Union) to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose Personal Information and any other information about you to government or law enforcement officials (and private parties, outside of the European Union) if, in our discretion, we believe it is necessary or appropriate in order to respond to legal requests (including court orders and subpoenas), to protect the safety, property or rights of pCloud or of any third party, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

Be Careful When You Share Information with Others

Please be aware that whenever you share information on a publicly available profile page or any other public forum on the Site, that information may be accessed by others. In addition, please remember that when you share information in any other communications with third parties, that information may be passed along or made public by others. This means that anyone with access to such information can potentially use it for any purpose, including sending unsolicited communications.

Security

We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of information transmitted to us. However, no data transmission over the Internet or other network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect information transmitted on or through the Site or Services, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the Site or Services, and you do so at your own risk.

Links To Other Web Sites

Our Site and Services may contain links to other websites, or allow others to send you such links. A link to a third party's website does not mean that we endorse it or that we are affiliated with it. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. You access such third-party websites or content at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a third-party website before providing any information to the website.

Children's Privacy

Please be advised that we process and store all information on secure servers in the United States and/or the European Union. This is necessary in order to process your Personal Information. The laws in the United States or the European Union may not be as protective of your privacy as those in your location.
