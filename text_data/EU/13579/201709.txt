Locally Stored Data from Browsers and Devices. We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. Cookies and other tracking toolsCookies and other website tracking tools are small text files sent to your Internet browser from a web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Since many websites rely on cookies and/or other tracking tools to help tailor an individual’s experience, most Internet browsers are initially set up to accept them. If you object to cookies or other types of tracking tools, you can review the settings of your browser for guidance on how to manage or refuse to accept cookies and other tracking mechanisms.

“Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection. Some newer Internet browsers have incorporated Do Not Track features, and when turned on, they send a signal to the websites you visit, telling the website that you do not want to be tracked while browsing. Websites differ in how they respond to these Do Not Track signals, as there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the Do Not Track signal. Because of this lack of clarity, Clarivate does not respond to the browser Do Not Track signal. Thus, most cookies will continue to be stored on your hard drive until you delete them.Google Invisible reCAPTCHAWe may use Google Invisible reCAPTCHA to secure our products and websites from abuse.
