For more on how we handle information collected from clients and publishers or visitors to our Sites, please see “Use of the Conversant Sites as a Visitor or Client” below.Children (persons under the age of 18) are not eligible to do business with us and we do not collect PII from any person of whom we have actual knowledge is under the age of 13. If you believe your child has provided Conversant with any personally identifiable data by registering at Conversant’s Web site, please contact us at privacy@conversantmedia.com to have them removed. By using our website or the website of any of our publishers in our networks or submitting information to us, you consent to Conversant’s use and sharing of the information collected or submitted as described in this Privacy Policy.Please be aware that in addition to our Sites, the websites of our clients and publishers, applications on which we place advertisements, and any third party websites linked to one of our sites may also collect information from you for various purposes, including, but not limited to, providing advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. Such information collected by such websites and their affiliated or third party partners may include Non-PII through the use of cookies and other technologies and any PII you may choose to give in registering and transacting with such website. Although we choose our business partners and clients carefully, Conversant is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of such websites you visit to determine how they handle any information they collect from you.TopWHAT CONVERSANT DOESWhile you may only visit certain websites, there are other companies working behind the scenes to help provide you with a great experience online. These third party companies provide vital services such as analytics, advertising, and fraud prevention to retailers, publishers, and other organizations. These services enable them to, among other things, provide the advertising that keeps your favorite blogs free, your favorite stores in business, and your advertising experience more relevant.We help companies provide advertising online, both in browsers and mobile applications, and we do it in a variety of ways, from banner ads to coupon codes. To make some of these things possible, we need to have information available to provide smarter decision making. Technologies such as cookies and advertiser IDs enable companies like ours to provide more relevant advertising while keeping your identity anonymous. In addition to our advertising services, we also utilize our technology to provide life-saving messages during tornadoes and AMBER Alerts, geotargeted to individuals in affected areas. To learn more about these internationally-recognized programs established by Conversant through an organization called the Federation for Internet Alerts, click here.TopPRIVACY BY DESIGNOur philosophy on privacy at Conversant follows the framework of Privacy by Design. We integrate privacy in strategy, product development, and more. We set the tone for privacy protection early and often, proactively working to keep PII out of our systems, and building technologies that are effective without the use of PII. We can protect consumer privacy AND provide relevant advertising, which benefits everyone involved, especially advertisers, consumers, and small business websites. Ensuring the protection of privacy throughout the entire lifecycle of the data is of the utmost importance and Conversant is careful to protect privacy as data is collected, used, and destroyed responsibly.We constantly strive to maintain unparalleled visibility with consumers. We provide transparency and choice through our website, encourage the same practice throughout the Internet, and utilize AdChoices on each banner advertisement tailored to consumers’ interests.Conversant has developed a strong privacy foundation and has a company culture aimed at the prevention of the receipt and use of PII. We respect consumer privacy, and give consumers the ability to opt out of receiving interest-based advertising (“IBA”).TopINFORMATION COLLECTION AND USEInformation Collected by ConversantConversant only collects Non-PII from you (unless PII is provided by you voluntarily), and may collect this in a variety of ways. We may use technologies such as cookies, log files, pixel tags or other similar technologies to collect Non-PII about the browser or device you are using, including browsing activity, online transactions, and IP addresses. We may also receive Non-PII from third parties. Some clients contribute PII such as your name, address, email address, and associated transactional information directly to a third party with whom Conversant has a contractual relationship. This third party renders all such PII anonymous before providing it to Conversant for our use in providing advertising to you. All Non-PII received and collected by Conversant may be combined and used to provide you advertising, and for other purposes as determined by Conversant.We may also conduct surveys by serving interactive ads that ask you to provide information such as your gender and age range, which information may be associated with a device ID or a cookie ID (which is Non-PII). If you decide to respond, your demographic information will also be associated with an anonymous device ID or cookie ID and used only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.“Cookies” are files that are stored on your web-enabled client (such as your web browser or mobile device) and are used to improve your experience when seeing web and mobile advertisements and ensure that when you click on an ad, you are sent to the correct click-through destination. We may use cookies to estimate the total reach of an advertising campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. There are many misconceptions about cookies. Cookies cannot erase your hard drive, install programs, or collect PII from your browser or device. For more information about Cookies please click here. “Log files” track actions occurring on Sites and collect data including, as an example, your, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, click data and types of advertisements viewed."Web beacons" are objects that are embedded in a web page or e-mail and are usually invisible to the user but are used to track a web user’s navigation of a website or collection of websites or pages, interaction with an e-mail, use of mobile applications, the completion of transactions, submittal of applications and browsing behavior.“Location Data” recognizes a consumer’s location while they are on their device which is utilized by Conversant to deliver advertisements.  As with all data Conversant collects, this is anonymous and is limited to non-precise as defined by the Network Advertising Initiative’s current definition of imprecise location data unless the consumer has opted in to allow their precise location to be used for IBA.The Non-PII collected is used for marketing purposes, enables us to determine which advertisements perform well, allows us to more effectively match ads, mobile application and website content to your interests, assists us in improving the operation of our services, helps us to maintain the quality of our services, enhances our services to our business partners and clients and enables us to provide general statistics to our business partners and clients regarding use of Conversant’s services. Conversant may also act as delivery agent when its products and services are used directly by client to facilitate advertisements and other communications.Conversant is in full compliance with the NAI Code of Conduct with regard to the collection and use of health information.  This health-related information, when collected on an opt-out basis for IBA, is non-sensitive and not associated with PII.  The NAI also permits Conversant to collect and use sensitive health information when the user provides explicit opt-in consent in the United States.  Health-related information is collected and used by Conversant in compliance with the laws, rules and regulations of the countries in which we operate. For a list of health segments used by Conversant, click here.When a consumer responds to or views an Internet advertisement served by Conversant (such as through third-party websites or email solicitations) or visits a Conversant site, we may assign an anonymous, unique identifier to the end user's Internet browser or device, often via a cookie. One function of these technologies is to provide Conversant with information for the purpose of paying third-parties affiliate commissions when an Internet user clicks on a link, creates a lead, or makes a purchase on an advertiser's website. If the Internet user re-visits the advertiser's site directly, Conversant is able to continue to track the user's activities (excluding PII) on the advertiser's site and reward the third-party website that referred the user. We also may use Internet browsing, cross-mobile application browsing and online purchase data associated with an anonymous user across multiple devices to develop a predictive statistical user profile of the end user's needs and interests for the purpose of sending them relevant advertisements.  This is called cross-device IBA.Information Sharing by ConversantConversant will only share your information for limited purposes such as those provided in this Privacy Policy. This may include sharing information (1) to enable third party service providers to assist or facilitate in the services we provide to our clients; (2) to comply with applicable laws and regulations or to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information received by us, whether or not a response is required by applicable law; (3) to enforce our terms of use and other agreements or to protect our rights ; (4) to protect the safety of members of the public and users of the service; (5) with other Conversant entities and clients for marketing purposes; (6) with vendors, administrative service providers, technology providers, and carefully selected partners for services including, but not limited to, data validation, enhancement, information verification and suppression services; (7) for any other purpose for which you provide consent; or (8) for any suppression or opt-out purposes. None of this information will include PII except as provided herein. While Conversant strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, Conversant is not responsible for the information practices of such clients and partners. With respect to IBA, Conversant and other third parties may use Non-PII collected or shared with respect to your visits to websites with whom we have relationships for various purposes, including, but not limited to, providing advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.In the event that Conversant is acquired by or merged with a third party, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your information is treated, transferred, or used.Service-specific Provisions for Information Collection and Use:Some products and services offered by Conversant have privacy considerations unique to those offerings. These considerations are covered here.Lead Generation:Conversant provides lead generation services to clients where we work with website publishers who utilize their display, search and email distribution channels to generate consumer interest or inquiry into advertiser products and services. The co-registration component refers to the process in which Conversant facilitates the exchange of consumer information (typically PII held by website publisher in accordance with their Privacy Policy) from website publishers to advertisers.We may receive PII that our clients have collected in connection with our services for our clients or that clients have collected for access or transmittal purposes to other clients. We may hold such information and/or transmit or allow access to such information to the intended recipients or categories of recipients as requested by our clients.As part of the Lead Gen services, online forms hosted by us, our clients, or third parties acting on the behalf of us or our clients may collect PII that a consumer has voluntarily provided. This information may be used for the same purposes listed in “Information Sharing by Conversant,” above. This information may also be used to verify any information submitted to use or any of our clients, and for any suppression or opt-out purposes.Conversant may serve advertisements to you based, in part, on the demographic and geographic information you submitted to our clients during the website registration process, and lifestyle information about you that we obtain from them and other Conversant entities and third parties.SecurityThe security of your information is important to us. We have implemented appropriate security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. We take physical and technical security measures to protect our data from unauthorized access, as well as unauthorized disclosure or destruction of data.No transmission of data over the Internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. While we strive to protect your data, it may be possible for third parties not under the control of Conversant to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise data security. Conversant cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with Conversant.RetentionWe retain Non-PII for IBA for no more than eighteen (18) months. Aggregate reports generated from such data may be retained for a longer period, as ad delivery and reporting data.TopSELF-REGULATION & VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCEOur industry has a rigorous voluntary self-regulatory regime, and we are active members of industry groups such as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), and European Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) who promulgate codes of conduct to which their members must adhere. These codes impose requirements on participating companies such as transparency and choice around the use of data for IBA, and require regular audits of member privacy practices.Conversant is an active member of these and other groups, and where Conversant engages in activities regulated by these programs, we comply fully with both the NAI Code of Conduct, and the EDAA Self-Regulatory Principles.TopYOUR CHOICESWe hope that after reading through this Privacy Policy that you feel comfortable we are collecting and using data responsibly, and that the cumulative benefits of our work are valuable to the Internet as a whole and your individual browsing experience.

These rules differ significantly from the laws of the United States of America (“US”). To reconcile these differences, the US and the EU have created a safe harbor (“Safe Harbor”) that defines mutually acceptable privacy operations.Conversant complies with the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
