Privacy Statement
Introduction

            We care about your privacy. We only send your data to third parties, when we're legally required to do so, when it's required for correct working of a feature or when the data is strictly anonymous.
        

            We use common tools to analyse our product performance. The techniques and tools are listed in this document with a means of an opt-out, where applicable.
        

            If you disagree with our Privacy Statement, we like to know why so that we can learn and possibly re-evaluate our strategy. Unfortunately, when you disagree, you should discontinue using our services.
        
What kind of personal data do we collect

            We can't offer our services without asking some details. For starters, who'll be joining you with your next event and some details (name and email) of you. Furthermore we need to save things like any locations you liked, any chat message you leave behind and of course the details (title, description, dates, etc.) of the event.
        

            If you use our support system, you might be asked certain specific details in order to help you with any problem you might have on our platform. This means we might need to look at your event, it's participants or your name/email. We might need to use these details in other systems to (for example: lift a blockage) be of service.
        

            Other things we (temporarily) store (or use) are your IP address, the browser you use, language settings, the brand of your phone, etc. Not all of the information is actually used by us, some of the data is simply a technical necessity. In other instances it helps us figure out what kind of platforms we should optimise our services for and to prevent abuse of our platform.
        

            We also need your (approximate) location. To show you relevant location suggestions and also for legal (tax) reasons (we need to know the country where you're from).
        

            Some of the data we use for statistical analysis and training of our AI models. The data we use for this is firstly anonymised and stored separately.
        

            Other partners might give use data about you as well, for example about the amount of reservations you've made, or in the case of a single-sign-on construction, your name and login details, so that we can log you in to a specific part of our platform you.
        

            To opt out of receiving any and all email, you can have your email address blocked. This means you won't receive any event updates, invites or reminders. Effectively this prevents you from using our platform.
        

            If you need any assistance, please contact us on: Helpdesk page.
        

            If you want to delete your data, please login and visit: Account and click "delete account".
        

            We explicitly ask your location when organising an event and as App permission. To revoke these permissions follow the guides of your specific browser or app vendors.
        
Advertisement

            We run various forms of advertisements on the free version of out platform. If you do not wish to receive targeted advertisements (aka "direct marketing") you can opt out from Google's profiling here: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated. For more information about the advertisements run by Semilo, please find the information they provide on: https://semilo.nl/cookieconsent/.
        

            We also run advertisements using "contextual marketing". For this we don't look at personal data, but instead at the event as a whole.
        

            Our premium version does not include any advertisements.
        
What data is shared with 3rd parties

            We do not sell or hand out personal or event data, because it might have value. If we exchange data with a party it's to comply with Dutch law, to facilitate your request or to improve our product so that we can better serve you.
        

            An example of this: If you click on "make a reservation" we might prefill the input fields with the details we already know, for example: your name, email and perhaps the size of the group, so that you don't have to fill in those fields.
        

            When you use our support system, we might send some data to better assist you. Things like: The version of the app you're using, or your browser. Your name and email, so that we can follow up on your questions and possibly other details that could help us assist you better.
        

            In the case of a white-label service, additional conditions can apply.
        
How do we use Social Media

            We offer login services or share integration. We don't read more data then we need for the login and we won't post a message on your behalf.
        
What's the minimum required age

            Because we can't easily integrate an age check, we've set the minimum age to use our services at 18 years. People of 17 years or younger can only use our services with the consent of their parents or legal guardians.
        
How can you control the personal data we have of you

            You have the right to view the data we keep of you. You can request an overview by contacting us through our support system here: Helpdesk page.
        
Who is processing your personal data

            Plan To Meet B.V., located in Wateringen, The Netherlands, controls the processing of personal data on its platform.
        
Session recording

            To better understand how our product are used, we employ various techniques. One of those techniques is "Session Recording". Here we get heatmaps and anonymised recordings of how our visitors use our product. This allows us to analyse the performance of features. They help us find features that are too complex or features that people are looking for, but are unable to find easily.
        

            If you want to opt-out from session recording, please find the opt-out page here: https://www.inspectlet.com/optout.
