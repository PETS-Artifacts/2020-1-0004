We may also independently audit these service providers to make sure that they meet our standards.\r\n\t\r\n\tWe will not share your personal data with anyone else for their own marketing purposes unless we have your permission to do this.\r\n\t\r\n\tSome of our webpages use social plug-ins from other organizations (such as the \xe2\x80\x9cFacebook Recommend\xe2\x80\x9d function, Twitter\xe2\x80\x99s retweet function, Google+ function). These other organizations may receive and use personal data about your visit to our sites or apps. If you browse our site or view content on our apps, information they collect may be connected to your account on their site. For more information on how these organizations use personal data, please read their privacy policies.\r\n\r\n\tThird Party-Payment Processors\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tAll transactions which are processed are subject to our third-party payment processor\xe2\x80\x99s privacy policies. Before purchasing items or services on our site and before providing any personally identifiable information to any of our third-party payment processors you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third-party payment processors responsible for processing your transaction, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy. The privacy policies of our third-party payment processors shall be incorporated into this Privacy Policy by reference. You also agree that it is necessary for both us and any third-party payment processor to maintain a record of all transactions processed on this website.\r\n\tInternational data transfers\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tData we collect may be transferred to, stored and processed in any country or territory where one or more of our affiliates or service providers are based or have facilities. While other countries or territories may not have the same standards of data protection as those in your home country, we will continue to protect personal data that we transfer in line with this privacy policy.\r\n\t\r\n\tWhenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure similar protection and put in place at least one of these safeguards:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWe will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been found to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data.\r\n\t\tWe may also use specific approved contracts with our service providers that are based in countries outside the EEA. These contracts give your personal data the same protection it has in the EEA .\r\n\t\tWhere we use service providers in the United States, we may transfer personal data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield scheme, which requires them to provide a similar level of protection of your personal data to what is required in the EEA.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you are located in the EEA, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place for the transfer of your personal data outside the EEA.\r\n\tHow long we keep your personal data\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe keep your personal data for only as long as we need to. How long we need your personal data depends on what we are using it for, as set out in this privacy policy. For example, we may need to use it to answer your queries about a products or service and as a result may keep personal data while you are still using our product or services. We may also need to keep your personal data for accounting purposes, for example, where you have bought a membership. If we no longer need your data, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you. If we have asked for your permission to process your personal data and we have no other lawful grounds to continue with that processing, and you withdraw your permission, we will delete your personal data. However, when you unsubscribe from marketing communications, we will keep your email address to ensure that we do not send you any marketing in future.\r\n\tHow we may contact you\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tService communications\r\n\t\r\n\tFrom time to time we may send you service emails, for example, telling you your membership is coming to an end or thanking you when you contribute or place an order with us.\r\n\t\r\n\tMarketing communications and editorial newsletters\r\n\t\r\n\tIf we have your permission, we may send you materials we think may interest you, such as offers and updates. Depending on your marketing preferences, this may be by email, phone, SMS or post.\r\n\t\r\n\tYou can decide not to receive these emails at any time and will be able to \xe2\x80\x9cunsubscribe\xe2\x80\x9d directly by clicking a link in the email or by emailing dpo@saganltd.com.\r\n\t\r\n\tResponding to your queries or complaints\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you have raised a query or a complaint with us, we may contact you to answer your query or to resolve your complaint.\r\n\tCookies and similar technology\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen you visit our sites or when you use our apps, we may collect personal data from you automatically using cookies or similar technology. A cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognize and remember you.\r\n\t\r\n\tThis privacy policy includes our\xc2\xa0cookie policy, where you can find details of our key advertising partners.\r\n\tOnline advertising\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAdvertising on our sites that is based on cookies and similar technology\r\n\t\r\n\tWe use personalized online advertising on our sites. This allows us to deliver more relevant advertising to people who visit our site. It works by showing you adverts that are based on your browsing patterns and the way you have interacted with our sites and apps. It then shows you adverts which we believe may interest you.\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen you browse our sites or use our apps, some of the cookies and similar technology we place on your device are advertising cookies, so we can understand what sort of pages you are interested in. We can then display advertising on your browser based on these interests.\r\n\t\r\n\tWe do not collect or use information such as your name, email address, postal address or phone number for personalized online advertising.\r\n\t\r\n\tWe may also share online data collected through cookies and similar technology with our advertising partners. This means that when you are on another website, you may be shown advertising based on your browsing patterns on our site. We may also show you advertising on our site based on your browsing patterns on other sites that we have obtained from our advertising partners.\r\n\t\r\n\tOnline retargeting is another form of online advertising that allows us and some of our advertising partners to show you advertising based on your browsing patterns and interactions with a site away from our sites.\r\n\t\r\n\tFor example, if you have visited the website of an online clothes shop, you may start seeing adverts from that same shopping site displaying special offers or showing you products you were browsing. This allows companies to advertise to you if you leave their website without making a purchase.\r\n\tAdvertising that we place on our site or on other sites\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe also use personalized online advertising to promote our own products and services. This means that you may see advertising for our products and services on our sites and when you are on other, third party websites, including social media platforms.\r\n\tYour rights with regard to the personal data that we hold about you\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tYou can contact us with regard to the following rights in relation to your personal data:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf you would like to have a copy of the personal data we hold on you or if you think that we hold incorrect personal data about you, please write to the Data Protection Officer at dpo@saganltd.com. We will deal with requests for copies of your personal data or for correction of your personal data within one month. If your request is complicated or if you have made a large number of requests, it may take us longer. We will let you know if we need longer than one month to respond. You will not have to pay a fee to obtain a copy of your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.\r\n\t\tWhere you have provided us with consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw this at any time.\r\n\t\tWhere applicable, you may also have a right to receive a machine-readable copy of your personal data.\r\n\t\tYou also have the right to ask us to delete your personal data or restrict how it is used. There may be exceptions to the right to erasure for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request. Where applicable, you have the right to object to processing of your personal data for certain purposes.\r\n\t\tIf you do not want us to use your personal data for marketing analysis, you can do so by emailing dpo@saganltd.com.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you want to make any of these requests, please contact\xc2\xa0dpo@saganltd.com.\r\n\t\r\n\tWe may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity.\r\n\tYour California privacy rights\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tUnder California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you live in California and your business relationship with us is mainly for personal, family or household purposes, you may ask us about the information we release to other organizations for their marketing purposes.

We will email you a list of categories of personal data we revealed to other organizations for their marketing purposes in the last calendar year, along with their names and addresses. Not all personal data shared in this way is covered by Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.\r\n\tCanada Privacy Rights\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe comply with Canadian Federal and Provincial privacy laws and regulations including the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act.\r\n\t\r\n\tWe will only use your personal information for the purposes intended and as detailed in this privacy policy unless we have obtained your consent to use it for other purposes.\r\n\t\r\n\tResidents of Canada are notified that the personal information they provide to us is stored in our databases outside of Canada including in the United States and may be subject to disclosure to authorized law enforcement or government agencies in response to lawful demand under the laws of that country.\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you need to contact us about your personal information or believe that we have violated your privacy rights, please email us at dpo@saganltd.com.

If required by law, we will get your permission or give you the opportunity to opt out of any new uses of your data.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tCookie Policy\r\n\tWhat is a cookie?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tA cookie is a small file that can be placed on your device that allows us to recognize and remember you.

There are more details about both in the following sections.\r\n\tWhat types of cookies do we use ?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWe use four types of cookies, which we describe in this section.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEssential \xe2\x80\x93 cookies that are essential to provide you with services you have requested.
