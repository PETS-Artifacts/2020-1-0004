Our Privacy Policy
We at Payment Express take your privacy seriously, and will only use your personal information for the purposes permitted by law and specified in this privacy policy. Please read it, and let us know if you have any questions.
Who is Payment Express?
Payment Express is a group of companies consisting of Payment Express Limited, its affiliates and its subsidiaries, that provides technical solutions to businesses that allow them to process payments in e-commerce, and via physical payment devices, such as card readers. With respect to any of your personal data collected during or otherwise processed in connection with your use of a Payment Express terminal, or our ecommerce payment solution, Payment Express acts as data controller.
Payment Express Protects Your Personal Information at Least Up to the Standards Set Forth by PCI-DSS
Payment Express, is committed to protecting your privacy whenever you buy goods or services from a merchant that uses Payment Express payment solutions (“Merchant”). Merchants will generally use Payment Express payment solutions when customer uses a credit or debit payment card over the internet, telephone, fax, unattended or integrated electronic funds transfer at the point of sale (EFTPOS) system. As such, please note that your Merchant acts as the data controller.
Payment Express recognizes its responsibility to keep confidential at all times any information that Payment Express acquires in connection with such a transaction, whether directly from a cardholder or Merchant. Payment Express protects personal information - at a minimum - to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS). To learn more about PCI-DSS, please see our PCI-DSS section below, or visit the PCI Security Standards Council’s website, at: https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/.
Please note, however, that Payment Express’s responsibility is limited to protection by Payment Express of information that Payment Express obtains. Payment Express itself cannot control the use or disclosure by your Merchant of any information that it obtains from you.
How We Collect Information
To enable Payment Express to provide secure payment facilities, we will typically acquire information which may include a cardholder's name, credit card number (with the expiry date) and billing address. That information is collected when a card and its information is provided to a Payment Express solution.
How We Use and Disclose Information
Payment Express uses the information it collects to obtain authorization of transactions from the payment card’s issuing bank (the bank that issued your credit or debit card) and from Payment Express's own or the Merchant's bank (the “acquirer” or “acquiring bank”) – this is done in order to process the payment. Some details from the transaction (such as name, email and delivery address) may be made available to the Merchant or acquiring bank through Payline - Payment Express’s web-based transactions management system, which allows Merchants to track transactions and process refunds. Payment card numbers themselves will be encrypted and stored by Payment Express securely, and will not be provided to the Merchant. Please note that your personal data may be shared with legal authorities if required by law. In addition, and separate from its performance of the services set forth in this privacy policy, Payment Express may aggregate and disclose aggregate data that is not personally identifiable to its partners or third parties. This aggregated, non-identifiable data may be used for statistical analysis or similar purposes.
Security
Payment Express is committed to data security. Payment Express uses a variety of technologies and procedures to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, Payment Express stores the data in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities secured by advanced surveillance and security technology. When Payment Express transmits sensitive information (such as a payment card number), Payment Express protects it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Credit card details stored onsite are encrypted using 168bit 3DES encryption. Payment Express is a level 1 certified PCI-DSS compliant provider.
What is PCI-DSS?
PCI-DSS, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, is a set of security requirements relating to the protection of cardholder data. The standard is governed by the Payment Card Industry (PCI) Security Standards Council, an organisation put together by most of the major card schemes - VISA, MasterCard, American Express, JCB and Discover. It is relevant for any entity that stores or transmits sensitive cardholder data, that being generally things like the PAN (card number), card security code, track data, and PIN block. Preceding PCI-DSS, the card schemes had their own standards, and the VISA Account Information Security (AIS) standard formed the basis to most of the PCI-DSS requirements.
