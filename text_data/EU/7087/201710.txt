To enable you to access our website and use our services
We will use your information to accept you as a new/returning customer and continue
                                            to provide you with our products and services.
To let you know about significant changes to our products, terms or privacy policy
We will let you know by email, SMS, push notification or when you log in to the site
                                            if there are significant changes to our products, their features, our terms,
                                            or our privacy policy.
To confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide
As part of providing services to you we will confirm your identity and authenticate
                                            the information you provide for security purposes.
Establishing your identity is important as the services may provide you with your
                                            personal credit information (such as your credit score or credit report) and
                                            we must be sure you are who you say you are. Identity checking may also involve
                                            checking the registration information you give us against information we already
                                            hold about you as a credit reference agency and potentially publicly available
                                            information about you such as from social media.
If we are unable to confirm your identity from the registration information you provide,
                                            we will let you know by using the contact details you have provided and you may
                                            then have the option to make a written application and provide further proof
                                            of your identity.
To process payments and collect arrears
We will use your information to process the payments you commit to when signing up
                                            to our services and for the collection of any future payments or overdue amounts
                                            for those services.
Your payment card provider may let us know if the card details relating to your Experian
                                            payment change. If this happens, we reserve the right to update certain card
                                            details to make sure your access to our services isn’t interrupted.
So for example, if you get a new payment card with a later expiry date to the one
                                            you currently pay with (but all the other details stay the same), we may update
                                            your payment card expiry date accordingly.
To provide and improve customer support
We will use your information to be able to provide and improve the customer support
                                            we provide to you (e.g. when you have questions or when you forget your log-in
                                            information).
                                        
To provide alerts 
We will use your information to send you alerts where ‘Alerts’ are part of the service
                                            you ask us to provide e.g.

web-monitoring when we find your personal details are available to others online.
where there are certain changes to your credit report.

To send you service communications
We will use your information to contact you to tell you about changes to or issues
                                            affecting the services you are taking.
To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings
When you use our comparison service to search for products, the information you provide
                                            is used to retrieve information about products relevant to your search and create
                                            a table which allows you to compare them.
Where eligibility ratings are available, information from your credit file with Experian
                                            (and sometimes Callcredit and Equifax) is also used to help you understand whether
                                            you are likely to be accepted.
In some circumstances, we will share that information and your personal information
                                            (such as name and address) with brokers, lenders and providers of credit and
                                            financial products themselves (as described in the section "Who we share your
                                            personal information with").
To provide information related to your use of our comparison services
When you search for products, we may contact you by email or SMS to confirm activity
                                            relating to use of our comparison services, such as details of the searches you
                                            have made, results that you have seen when searching, or information about introductions
                                            you’ve requested to brokers and lenders.
To send you product eligibility alerts
As part of our free services (which are available to all customers), Experian will
                                            retrieve and use your credit bureau data (whether it’s from Experian or the other
                                            two main credit reference agencies Equifax and Callcredit) to check your eligibility
                                            (as described in the above section ‘To provide comparison services and create
                                            eligibility ratings’) for third party products or services and notify you of
                                            credit opportunities, products and services that you may be eligible for.
When you log in to the website, we will show you updated eligibility ratings for
                                            products and services that may be available to you.
As part of this service we may also notify you by e-mail, SMS or post of new or updated
                                            eligibility ratings for products and services; for example if new products and
                                            services are added, or your eligibility has changed. You can chose not to receive
                                            email, SMS and postal communications about product eligibility whenever you want
                                            from your Experian Account page.
We will check your eligibility for third party products and services, and may send
                                            you alerts:

when you log in to the website;
when you request an eligibility check;
at regular intervals (no more than every 30 days) since you last requested an
                                                eligibility check;
when new credit products and services are added to the website;
when there is a change to your credit bureau data or Experian Credit Score (and
                                                we may pro-actively check your credit bureau data and Experian Credit Score
                                                to do this – which will not affect your credit rating);
when we predict you may be interested in a new credit product or service, for
                                                example if your existing promotional period is coming to an end.

                                            products, services or offers, or those of our third party partners, may interest
                                            you, we or they may contact you about them by email, SMS, on the phone, through

To maintain our records and other administrative functions
Like any business, we need to ensure that we maintain comprehensive and up to date
                                            records of the ways we process your personal information and other operational
                                            activities and therefore we will process the information you provide for record-keeping,
                                            updates and general administrative purposes.
Complaint and dispute resolution
Whilst we will try to make sure that you are happy with the service we provide and
                                            do not feel the need to complain, if you do complain to us, we will use the information
                                            we have about you to help us manage your complaint.
To comply with the law
Like any other business, we are required to comply with many laws and regulations.
                                            We will, where necessary, use your personal data to the extent required to enable
                                            us to comply with these requirements.
To improve data accuracy and completeness
Personal information you provide to us may be used to improve the credit bureau information
                                            we already hold about you in our role as a credit reference agency. E.g. if you
                                            provide a different address to the one we hold already we may store the new address
                                            in the credit bureau information to aid quicker identification of you and ensure
                                            that lenders can see a full picture of you when making lending decisions, it
                                            also aids identification and verification in the credit application process.
Email tracking
Experian may use performance tracking technology within our emails to improve our
                                            future interactions with you. This means we are able to capture information including
                                            (but not limited to) the time and date you open our e-mails and the type of device
                                            used to open the email.
We use this information primarily to understand whether our e-mails are opened and
                                            what links are clicked on by our customers. We then use this information to improve
                                            the emails that we send to you and the services that we provide.
We may share this information with other organisations to help them improve their
                                            own interactions with you. Your personal data will not be passed to any third
                                            party for marketing purposes unless you already have an existing relationship
                                            with them. You will not receive marketing emails from such third party organisations
                                            unless you have given your prior consent to them to send emails to you.

If we use your personal information for any purposes that are not set out in this
                                            Privacy Policy we promise to let you know exactly what we will use it for before
                                            we go ahead and use it and obtain your consent where appropriate.
