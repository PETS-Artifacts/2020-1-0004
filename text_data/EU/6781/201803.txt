Cookies
Cookies are used on Icy Veins for registration, traffic analysis, and advertisement purposes.
The Guardian has a very good article written about cookies and we encourage you to read it
here, as we feel that it would be pointless to
try and write something ourselves that would end up being far inferior.

reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those
we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to
attract anyone under 13.
