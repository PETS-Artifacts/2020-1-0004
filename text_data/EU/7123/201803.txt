Please see ‘How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologies’ for more information.You can find more detailed information about these technologies at:www.aboutcookies.orgwww.allaboutcookies.orgWhat are ‘cookies’?A cookie is a small text file that we, and in certain circumstances third parties, place on your browser (for example, Internet Explorer or Safari) when you visit our websites or open some of our emails. Cookies are useful because, amongst other things, they allow us to recognise you each time you re-visit one of our websites. The entity that places cookies on your browser can then read the information on the cookie that it set.Cookies are typically classified as either “session cookies” which do not stay on your device after you close your browser or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.How we and third parties use cookiesWe use cookies that are essential in order to enable you to move around our websites and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the websites. Without these cookies, services that you have asked for like shopping baskets cannot be provided.Some cookies, however, whilst useful, are not essential, and we require your consent before we can use these cookies. By continuing to browse on our Gofar Enterprises Ltd websites you agree to the use of these non-essential cookies unless you specifically set your browser to reject them. Please see ‘How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologies’ below for further details on your choices.Different cookies are used to perform different functions which we explain below. A visit to any Gofar Enterprises Ltd. website may generate the following types of cookie:Site performance cookiesWe use cookies to remember your selections on our websites: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make on our websites and provide enhanced, more personalised features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.Analytics cookiesWe use cookies for performance and analytics purposes: We use our own cookies and/or third-party cookies and other identifiers (such as web beacons) to see how you use our websites and services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, cookies and web beacons may be used to: test different designs and to ensure that we maintain a consistent look and feel across our websites; recognise repeat visitors, track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our websites and communications; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.The information collected from these types of cookies may be used in conjunction with other information we or our third party partners hold in order to record specific browsing information (for example, regarding the way visitors arrive at our websites, pages viewed, options selected, information entered and the path taken through our websites but is generally not used to identify you individually). The data collected will generally be aggregated to provide trends and usage patterns for business analysis, site/platform improvement and performance metrics and to inform our advertising and marketing strategies. Our cookies, or the resulting analysis, may also be shared with our business partners. We may also receive similar information about visitors to our group company and other partner websites.Advertising cookiesWe use cookies to personalise your experience and for targeted advertising purposes: We use cookies (and allow data management platform providers to use cookies on our behalf) to collect information about your browsing habits across our websites in order to provide personalised content, services and communications as well as targeted advertising on our websites, websites operated by our group companies and selected partner websites. For example, we may show you adverts for Marie Claire magazine if we know you have been browsing the fashion pages on our websites. If you use more than one device or computer on a regular basis, we may link cookies together so you will still receive a personalised online experience. We can also personalise the information you see based on what we already know about you, so that you spend less time looking for things. With the use of cookies, each visitor to our site can have a web experience which is unique to them.Cookies may also be linked with other information we hold or infer about you for these purposes. For example, if you are a registered user or provide us with your name, email address, social media log-in details or other contact information (e.g. by entering a competition or signing up to our newsletter) or interact with our email communications (e.g. by clicking on links within the emails), this information may be linked with your browsing activity across all your devices to tailor content, services, advertising and offers for you.You can opt out of receiving interest based advertising on our websites by blocking these cookies as described below in the section on ‘How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologies’.Third party advertising cookiesWe also permit advertisers, ad network providers and ad serving companies to place cookies on our websites to allow them to show you advertisements both on and off our websites that are more relevant and useful to you. However, we do not share any information with these third parties that will directly identify you, although these third parties may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalised advertisement or content are part of the group that the advertisement or content is directed towards. The third parties that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies and we have no access to read or write these cookies.Social media cookiesCookies may also be used when you share information using a social media sharing button on the websites. The social network will record that you have done this. This information may be linked to targeting/advertising activities. The types of cookies used by these third parties and how they use the information generated by them will be governed by those companies’ privacy policies. For information on how to opt out of targeting advertising, please go to ‘How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologies’ below.How we and third parties use web beaconsWe may use and permit selected third parties to use web beacons (usually in combination with cookies) to compile aggregate information about your website usage and your interaction with email and other communications to measure performance and to provide content and advertisements that are more relevant to you. A web beacon (also called a web bug, clear GIF or pixel tag) can be embedded in online content, videos and emails, and allows a server to read certain types of information from your device, to know when you have viewed the beacon and the IP address of your device. The type of information collected includes, but is not limited to, information relating to advertising responses, page views, promotion views and purchases made. We will include web beacons in some of our promotional email messages and newsletters to determine whether the messages have been opened or acted upon and whether our mailing tools are working correctly. The web beacons may be used to recognise cookies generated by third parties and inform us and/or third parties of which advertisement or link brought you to our website, allowing us to monitor the efficacy of our business relationships with third parties.How to manage or refuse cookies and similar technologiesCookiesIf you do not want your browser to accept cookies and use them in the ways described above it is possible to change your browser settings. It is also possible to delete existing cookies from your browser. However, blocking all cookies will affect your web experience and may result in some parts of Gofar Enterprises Ltd websites not functioning properly. Some cookies are designed to help save you time, for example, by remembering your contact details when you are making an order for the second time so that you will not have to complete the contact section again unless your details have changed.The procedure for modifying your privacy preferences is different for each internet browser and the following links may be helpful:Cookie setting in FirefoxCookie setting in SafariCookie setting in Internet ExplorerCookie setting in ChromeFor general information about cookies and their use, please visit:www.aboutcookies.orgwww.allaboutcookies.orgAlternatively, you can turn off third party cookies relating to interest based advertising by visiting www.youronlinechoices.eu. However, this will not opt you out of receiving adverts altogether – it simply means that the adverts will not be targeted to you.  Please note that there are many more networks listed on this site than we use on our websites.Web beaconsAs web beacons are the same as any other content request included in the recipe for a web page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, you may be able to disable web beacons in email messages by not downloading images contained in messages you receive (this feature varies depending on the email software used on your personal computer). However, doing this may not always disable a web beacon or other tracking technologies in the email message due to specific email software capabilities. For more information about this, please refer to the information provided by your email software or service provider. Web beacons may also be rendered ineffective in some circumstances by opting out of cookies or amending your cookie settings in your browser. Further details on web beacons, and how to manage them, can be found here:www.allaboutcookies.org/faqs/beacons.htmlIf you have any other queries about our use of cookies, you can contact us at the address above.Also read: Classified Rules and Forum Help
