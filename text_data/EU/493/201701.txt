Privacy Policy
Last Updated: December 22, 20161. Frequently Asked Questions – FAQsBecause we realize that privacy policies tend to be long and not terribly exciting, we’ve developed these FAQs to provide shortcuts to certain information in our Privacy Policy. These shortcuts are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices we provide in our complete Privacy Policy. The complete version of our Privacy Policy governs our collection, use, storage and sharing of information we collect or receive from you.Q: I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?A: You can access and update your account info by logging into your Unity account on our website.  We use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order for Unity to improve its software and services. We also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the Software which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software. You should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity. If you use Unity developer services such as mobile advertising and analytics, read the applicable FAQs below and our Cookie Policy.Q: I visit the Unity website, what should I know?A: We collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site. When you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.Q: I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?A: Unity has probably collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices) ); IP address; country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (example: "nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71"); which graphics API is in use (example: "OpenGL 2.1" or "Direct3D 9.0c"); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to create the  game; sensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle identification ("app ID") of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it did transmit correctly. Some Unity developers use Unity’s analytics and ad services which collect additional information. See FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below.Q: I play a game that uses Unity Analytics, what do I need to know?A: Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases. Using our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data. Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games. These reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device. If the developer uses Unity Analytics, the game was built using Unity’s game development software so be sure to review FAQ #1.   Some data collected by Unity Analytics may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising; see FAQ #6 below for more information.Q: I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?A: Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers,and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. Unity Ads may also incorporate data derived from the Unity Analytics service in user profiles and use that profile data in order to provide personalized advertising.  When Unity provides personalized advertising, it will provide you notice and information about how to opt-out of such interest based advertising. Please review the information contained under the heading  “What are my privacy choices for advertising?" below to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.Q: I play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?A: Unity has probably collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes.Q: What are device identifiers, like IDFA or fingerprints, and why do you collect them?A: Like many other providers of mobile apps instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user’s device through various device identifiers. Device identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps. For example, if we want to effectively limit the number of ads a particular device receives, we need to recognize the device across apps and use device identifiers to do so.Q: I use Unity’s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?A: Unity has probably collected unique device identifiers and your IP address as well as your activity within the service. If you have created an account with Unity’s game replay service, Unity has received any information you actively provided when setting up your account, including email address and username. Our primary use of your data will be provision of the game replay platform and all its features, including analysis and improvement. You can access and update your account info by visiting Everyplay and navigating to the user settings page. Also:When you create an account or profile your username, profile photo, cover photo, user description, users that you follow and users that follow you will all be public, which means that anyone can see that information and we, as well as others, may share it.Replays that are set to public will be viewable by anyone AND the service or the relevant Developer may use the replay to promote the service or the relevant game.When you comment on, share or like a replay using the Unity game replay platform, your replay, including any audio or video narration you attached to the replay, like or comments will be visible to others.When you share a replay on a social network - depending on your privacy settings on that social network, some users of that social network will see the replay.Q: I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store, what do I need to know?A: Unity has probably collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.
