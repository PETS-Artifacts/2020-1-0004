The information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your  ISP (internet service provider, such as Big Pond, Optus or AOL), your geographical area (e.g. country and state), the browser you used to visit our site (such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Firefox), the technology that you are using to access (PC, Mobile Phone, Tablet, etc.), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site.

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing Sydney real  estate ads to someone in Sydney, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking  sites).\r\n\r\n DoubleClick DART cookies  \r\n\r\nWe also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google\x92s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer or device when you are browsing the web and visit a site using  DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (\x94interest based  targeting\x94).\r\n\r\nThe ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Melbourne, you may see Melbourne  hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about Cricket). DART uses \x93non personally identifiable information\x94. It does NOT track  personal information about you.\r\n\r\nYou can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.aboutads.info/ or http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can choose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in Internet-Security programs. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to  services or programs, such as logging into forums.\r\n\r\nDeleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a  site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.\r\n\r\nVaruna Multimedia Productions may revise this Privacy Policy at any time by updating this posting.
