This privacy policy outlines how information collected through our site is both used and protected. Information which we request from users, or information that is made available to us will be used with accordance to this policy.
Information Collected
While registering on our site, users will be required to submit an e-mail address.
When signing in through the Steam OpenID provider, users will be authenticated using their 64-bit SteamID. Information made publicly available from this SteamID may also be collected, including, but not limited to, user game lists, playtime, badges, wishlists, and groups.
IP addresses and timezones are stored for users that have signed in with Steam.
How We Use Your Information
The information we collect may be used to personalize your experience with our site, while providing additional user functionality. E-mail addresses are used as a method of notification, and if a user is deemed the winner of a giveaway, their e-mail address will be made available to the giveaway creator. IP addresses are used to help identify the country a user is connecting from, allowing us to provide local pricing and sale data for their region. Timezones are used to personalize content and to convert dates and times into a user's local timezone.
Do We Disclose Any Information to Outside Parties?
We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or providing information to you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety.
