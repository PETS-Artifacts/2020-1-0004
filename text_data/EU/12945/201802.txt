Privacy Policy
IES is committed to protecting your privacy whilst providing a personalised and valuable service.  You may be asked to submit personal information about yourself in order to receive information or use services on our Website.  If you provide information to us, we will treat that information in accordance with this privacy policy.  By using this Website, you are agreeing to use of this information by us as described in this Policy.
 
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been fulfilled or, if you no longer wish to continue being registered for our services.
We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, and otherwise in accordance with Data Protection legislation.
The Information We Collect
We request very little identifying information from you and only for a narrow set of purposes. Typically, identifying information is collected:

• For registration to certain areas of the Website including competitions;
• To allow us to consider your comments, queries and suggestions and respond if necessary;
• To allow us to respond to your enquiries for further information; and
• To distribute requested materials;

The type of personal information collected on the Website could include your name, company name, address (including postcode), email address, telephone number (including mobile), user name and password.

Sometimes, we may ask questions where you are not personally identifiable from your response although we may post responses on the Website. These instances will be highlighted to you but in all other instances, you should assume that we track any information you provide on a personally identifiable basis.
The Way We Use Information
Users may provide their mobile phone numbers in order to receive relevant SMS text messages regarding offers featured on the Website.

If you register with the Website, you can elect to receive information and updates on our products and services. Information will not be used for this purpose unless you request to receive communications. We use return email addresses to answer any emails that we receive, and we may use return email addresses to send to other information that you may request. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose.

We may use information that you provide to better design the Website and to improve our marketing strategy and our products. We collect IP Addresses.  An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" Web pages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When you request a page from this Website, our servers log your IP address. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, so although your session will be logged, you will remain anonymous to us.

We may pass your personal information to one of our Group Companies or partner organisations who may send you details of services that may be of interest to you and offer you the opportunity to subscribe to them.  If you would prefer not to receive this information, please send an email to enquiries@iesve.com. A list of current partner organisations is available on request. Your personal information will not be supplied to any other persons without first obtaining your consent unless we are obliged by law to disclose it. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by us and the Group Companies in the manner described above.
