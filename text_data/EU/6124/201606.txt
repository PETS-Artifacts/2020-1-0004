Codewars may release non-personally-identifying information in the
aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its

discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances
that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as

ways that require Codewars to gather personally-identifying information.
The amount and type of information that Codewars gathers depends on
the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
at Codewars.com to provide a username, email address, and link to
their GitHub account. In each case, Codewars collects such information
only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the
visitor’s interaction with Codewars. Codewars also may collect statistics
about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Codewars does not
disclose personally-identifying information other than as described

employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located
outside of your home country; by using our websites, you consent to the

mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
