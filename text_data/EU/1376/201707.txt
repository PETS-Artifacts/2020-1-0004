This Privacy Statement describes Okta's privacy practices with regards to its Web sites and the related services and applications offered by Okta (collectively, the “Service”).
If You have questions or complaints regarding Okta’s Privacy Statement or practices, please contact Us at info@okta.com.
Okta complies with the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from Switzerland. 
Web Sites Covered
Okta has established this Privacy Statement to help You to understand how Okta collects and uses personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement covers the information practices of Web sites that link to this Privacy Statement, including, but not limited to http://www.okta.com, http://www.identityis.com, and http://www.oauth.com.
Okta's Web sites may contain links to other Web sites. Okta is not responsible for the information practices or the content of such other Web sites. The Company encourages You to review the privacy statements of other Web sites to understand their information practices.
Information Collected by Okta
Okta does not collect email addresses from the Okta commercial, fee-based production services for which we sell subscriptions (collectively, the “Service”) for marketing use. Okta does collect information from Visitors. This information is collected in accordance with this Privacy Statement, from sources that include but are not limited to content syndication, Web site registration forms, webinar registration forms and conferences.
Personal Information You Provide to Us. Okta collects information from Visitors to the Okta Web sites and Customers of the Service. Okta receives and stores any information entered when expressing an interest in obtaining more information about the Service or registering to use the Service. When Visitors expresses an interest in obtaining information about the Service or registering to use the Service on Okta’s Web sites, Okta may require Visitors to provide personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, email address, and any other information necessary for Us to provide Visitors with access to the various aspects of the Services (collectively, “Personal Information”). The Personal Information Visitors provide may be used for such purposes as answering questions, improving the content of the Web sites, customizing the content, and communicating with Visitors about Okta's Service, including specials and new features.
Personal Information Collected Automatically. As Visitors navigate or interact with Okta's Web sites, Okta may also automatically collect information through the use of commonly-used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons.
Other Third Party Tracking
Okta engages third parties, which use Web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta’s Web sites. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to Visitors’ Personal Information for marketing purposes.
Cookies:
Okta uses cookies to make interactions with the Web sites easy and meaningful. When a Visitor interacts with the Web sites, Okta's servers send a cookie to the Visitor’s computer. Standing alone, cookies do not personally identify the Visitor;they merely recognize the visitor’s Web browser. Unless the Visitor chooses to identify themself to Okta, either by responding to a promotional offer, opening an account, or filling out a Web form, Okta has no way to associate this cookie data with the Visitor’s Personal Information.
For the Web sites, Okta uses cookies that are session-based. Session cookies exist only during one session. They disappear from the Visitor’s computer upon closing their browser software or turning off their computer.
Most browsers have an option for turning off cookies, which will prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of the browser software) allowing the Visitor to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways.
Okta's Web sites connect Visitors to third party services, with whom Okta partners with to provide the relevant content. The use of cookies by Okta’s partners is not covered by Okta’s Privacyy Statement. Okta does not have access or control over these cookies. Okta’s partners use session ID cookies to manage a Customer's connection to the partner's service.

Web Beacons:
Okta uses Web beacons alone or in conjunction with cookies to compile information about Visitors’ usage of the Web sites, interaction with emails from Okta, and to operate and improve the Web sites. Web beacons are invisible electronic images that can recognize certain types of information on a Visitor’s computer, such as (1) cookies, (2) the time a particular Web site is viewed to the Web beacon, or (3) a description of a Web site tied to the Web beacon.

IP Addresses and Browser Information:
When a Visitor interacts with the Web sites, Okta collects their Internet Protocol ("IP") address(es), browser information and operating system to track and aggregate non-personal information. For example, Okta uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Visitors navigate the Web site, and for marketing purposes.

Other Third Party Tracking:
Okta engages third parties, which use web beacons, images, and scripts, to help better manage content on Okta's Web sites. Okta does not provide Personal Information to the third parties but may tie the information gathered from third party tracking to our Visitors' Personal Information for marketing purposes.
