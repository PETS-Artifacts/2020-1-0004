HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

Information Shared With Restaurants

			When you make a Restaurant reservation through our Sites, your information is provided to us and certain information is provided to the restaurants with whom you choose to reserve. In order to facilitate your reservation, certain information is provided to that restaurant, just as it would if you made a reservation by calling the restaurant, emailing the restaurant or using the restaurant’s website. If you provide a mobile phone number, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your reservation. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or debit card account information to secure your reservation. When you make a restaurant reservation through our Sites, we may also share with the restaurants additional information such as information about your dining preferences and history, or information that we collect via Third-Party Platforms. You also have the option of indicating special preferences or providing comments about your reservation that OpenTable will pass on to that restaurant.

			We may share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant through our Sites, these comments may be shared with that restaurant. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information such as an email address.

			Information you choose to share with a restaurant when you make a reservation through our Sites may be used by the restaurant for its own purposes. OpenTable does not control the privacy practices of restaurants. Please contact the restaurant directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

Information Shared With Gift Card Merchants

			If you purchase a Merchant Gift Card (or redeem an OpenTable Gift Card for a Merchant Gift Card) through our Sites, we notify the applicable issuer of the Merchant Gift Card and provide it with certain related information about your purchase or redemption, including your name, email address, and the amount of the Merchant Gift Card.

Payment Card Information

			To use certain services on our Sites, such as to make reservations at certain restaurants; and to purchase OpenTable Gift Cards, Merchant Gift Cards, or other products or services, we may require credit or debit card account information. By submitting your credit or debit card account information through our Sites, you expressly consent to the sharing of your information with restaurants, third-party payment processors, and other third-party service providers to the extent necessary for these services and/or for the purpose of detecting fraud, and you further agree to the following terms.

			·  When you use a credit or debit card to secure a reservation through our Sites, we provide your credit or debit card account information (including card number and expiration date, but excluding the CVV number) to our third-party payment service providers and the applicable restaurant.

			·  If you purchase OpenTable Gift Cards or Merchant Gift Cards from us, we collect the credit or debit card account information from you. We share this information with our third-party payment service providers in order to process your payments. These third parties may also store your credit or debit card information, other than your CVV number, for your future use on our Sites. Your CVV number will not be stored and must be re-entered for each order.

			·  For information about the security of your credit or debit card account information, see Section called “Security of Your Personal Information” below.

			Please be mindful of your own privacy needs and the privacy needs of others as you choose whom to connect with and what to share and make public. We cannot control the privacy or security of information you choose to make public or share with others. OpenTable also does not control the privacy practices of Third-Party Platforms. Please contact those sites and services directly if you want to learn about their privacy practices.

You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your OpenTable account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will consider that you have authorised the instructions.
