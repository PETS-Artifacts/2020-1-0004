Shared
With
 Restaurants and Their AffiliatesWhen you make a dining request through our Sites, such as a restaurant
reservation, joining a restaurant waitlist, or making a payment to a restaurant
through our Sites, we automatically provide certain categories of your
information to the restaurant
in order to
 facilitate
your request. For requests to dine,
this information may include your name, dining profile, time and date of visit, party size, your phone number, your
dining preferences, guest information, any special requests or comments that you
choose to submit (if any), and your email address. Your information is provided
to the restaurant, just as it would if you contacted the restaurant directly.
If you provide a mobile phone number
in connection with
your dining request, restaurants may send you text messages regarding your dining
request. Some restaurants also require you to provide credit or debit card
account information to secure your reservation.When you make a dining request, we may also share with the restaurant
additional information about you, such as information about your dining
activity and history, and/or information that we collect from third parties. Depending on where you reside, and as
permitted by applicable law, we or the restaurant may additionally share certain of your
information with such restaurant’s
affiliated restaurants (such as
affiliated brands), restaurant group and/or
restaurants with the same brand or
parent-brand
(collectively, such restaurant’s “restaurant group”),
or other entities associated with
such restaurant (such as the
parent entity of
the restaurant group or
affiliated hotels) and/or their
 service providers (collectively,
the associated entities and service
providers, such restaurant’s "restaurant affiliates")
under OpenTable’s programs. Specifically,
we or the restaurant may share your information (such as meal or seating preferences and
special occasions) with other restaurants in the same restaurant
group to enhance the hospitality such
restaurant group provides you when you
dine with them (such as, trying to seat you by a window, if you previously
expressed a preference for window seating) (“customized service”) and to improve the restaurant’s table and
shift planning. In
addition to providing you with more customized service,
we or the restaurant may, as permitted by applicable law,
share your information with such restaurant’s restaurant affiliates
to support operations, such as to perform analytics, tailor marketing
to you, support a loyalty program
that you
have chosen to participate in, and improve their services. The 
OpenTable
 entity identified here would be the services provider/data processor of the restaurants under these OpenTable programs. For more information, please feel free to contact the restaurants at
which you dine or book, or
OpenTable
 as detailed
in the Contact Us section below. To learn more about your choices
related to how we share your information with restaurants, restaurant groups,
and/or restaurant affiliates under our programs, please see the Your
Choices section below.We may share with
restaurants summary reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments
about a restaurant through our Sites, these comments may be shared with or may

are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or
provide contact information, such as an email address.b.    Information
