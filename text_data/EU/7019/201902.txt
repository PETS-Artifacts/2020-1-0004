Some of our CCTV infrastructure is shared with the British Transport Police, local authorities, Network Rail, and car park operators. In certain situations, they may take control of a limited number of cameras for activities such as the prevention and detection of crime and anti-social behaviour. ScotRail is not responsible for the CCTV when it is in the control of a third party.
If you have agreed (via freely given consent) to receive information for competition, promotion, survey or research purposes, we may share your contact details with any third parties identified or referenced in the consent for any purposes described in, or contemplated by, it.
