Our security 
Our websites use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to ensure that your information
                            is protected. Our web pages will start with https and a padlock will be displayed in front of
                            the web page name to show that we always encrypt the information that you send us. 
We maintain and enforce physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection,
                            storage and disclosure of your personal information. However, whilst we take appropriate technical
                            and organisational measures to safeguard your personal data, please note that we cannot guarantee
                            the security of any personal data that you transfer over the internet to us. 
Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose
                            personal information to you, including in relation to a subject access request. 
Payment security 
We are committed to ensuring the protection of your payment card details and are compliant with the
                            Payment Card Industry's Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).. Payments made via our sites are processed
                            and managed by specialist payment card companies which are not part of the Ocado Group. We only
                            store and display the first six and last four digits of your payment card number, the card type
                            and the card expiry date. The full payment card number is never stored on any of our systems
                            and is only stored and processed by one of our payment card processing companies.
We keep an encrypted token to represent your card and this token is transmitted to the relevant payment
                            card processing company during the order processing. 
We use 3D Secure to provide additional fraud protection and to protect your payment card from unauthorised
                            use. During the checkout process, you may be asked by 3D Secure to provide your Verified by Visa
                            or Mastercard Secure Code password.
                        
Password security 
It is important to keep your password secure to prevent fraudulent use of your account. Never disclose
                            your password to anyone else, and especially to anyone who requests it from you by telephone
                            or email  we will never do this (more information below). You should avoid using the same password
                            for other websites, because if their systems are hacked, the hackers will also be able to access
                            your account.
                        
Avoid using common terms for your password such as “password” or “123456”;
                            hackers know the most popular passwords and will try to access accounts using these. Instead,
                            try to use a combination of letters and numbers that means something to you so it's easy to remember
                            but difficult to guess. 
Personal security and identity fraud 
Using public wifi networks can be risky, and hackers may try to capture your online transactions
                            and personal details. You should only connect to networks that you trust. If you use a shared
                            computer, make sure that you log out once you have finished using the website. 
Criminals and fraudsters create authentic looking but false or "spoof" websites and send
                            phishing emails to steal confidential information. These emails pretend to be from a legitimate
                            company and try to trick a person into giving away their personal details (such as user names
                            and passwords) so that security details can be updated or passwords changed. 
We will never ask you to provide your personal details via email. If you receive an email like this
                            that claims to be from us and contains an embedded link and a request for you to enter any personal
                            details, treat it as suspicious and do not enter any personal information, even if the page appears
                            legitimate. If you suspect that your account details are subject to such fraudulent activities,
                            please let us know by calling our Contact Centre. 
Data Retention 
We retain your personal information for as long as you are a customer and we need it in order to
                            fulfil the purposes described above. After you stop being a customer, we may keep your data for
                            a certain period of time, after which we take steps to delete your personal information or hold
                            it in a form which no longer identifies you (as we may still need to use your data in an anonymised
                            format for research and other business purposes). 
We may keep your personal information for a number of reasons after you have stopped being a customer.
                            This includes: to respond to any questions or complaints, for legal, regulatory or technical
                            reasons, for research and analytics, to investigate fraudulent activities, and to show that we
                            treated you fairly.
                        
If you'd like to know more information about how long we keep your personal information, you'll find
                            more detail in the box below. 
Keeping your information 
We will keep your personal information for as long as you are a customer of the Ocado Group, which
                            includes ocado.com, fetch.co.uk, sizzle.co.uk and fabled.com, and for a period of time afterwards
                            if you stop doing so. 
Here are our time periods for retaining customer information: 

Customers that have registered but never shopped: we keep your personal information for eight
                                years after the date of first registration. 
Customers that have not shopped for an extended period of time: we keep your personal information
                                for seven years after the date of your last shop. 
Customers who have asked for their accounts to be closed: we keep your personal information for
                                seven years after the date your account was closed. 
Call recordings: we delete call recordings after three months unless we need the data to investigate
                                fraud, to respond to questions or complaints or for legal reasons. 
Customer account notes: after two years we delete notes made on your account by our call centre
                                advisors, unless we need the data to investigate fraud, to respond to questions and complaints,
                                or for legal reasons. 

Sending information outside the European Economic Area
 Our operations are based in the UK and the personal data that we collect from you is mainly processed,
                            stored and used within the UK and other countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). However,
                            in order to offer you the best service we can provide, we also work with service providers from
                            other parts of the world. This means that the data we collect sometimes needs to be transferred,
                            stored and used by companies operating outside the European Economic Area who work for us or
                            one of our service providers. We want you to know that we have taken steps to ensure there is
                            an appropriate level of security for the processing carried out in these countries, such that
                            data is protected in the same way as if it was being used within the EEA. 
This includes it going through one of these safeguards: 

The use of European Commission-approved standard contractual clauses in contracts for the transfer
                                of personal data to third countries. 
The transfer to organisations that are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield. This is a framework
                                that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure
                                those standards are similar to what is used within the EEA. 
Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs). These rules are like a code of conduct. They allow multinational
                                companies to transfer personal data internationally within the same corporate group to countries
                                that do not provide an adequate level of protection.
                            
Transfers to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA. 

You can find out more about the above data protection safeguards on the
                            European Commission Justice website.
