Background Information
parkrun Global Limited (parkrun Global) is a UK-based charity (Charity Number: 1175062) that ultimately oversees the delivery of parkrun events across the world. Each parkrun country has a relationship with parkrun Global (typically through a licence agreement or subsidiary status) that grants it the right to manage local parkrun events. As part of that relationship, parkrun Global collects, manages, and processes all associated data.

Our designated Data Protection Officer is Tom Williams (COO, parkrun Global).

Questions about this privacy policy may be submitted to parkrun Global via support.parkrun.com or by post to the address below.

1 |  Why We Need Your Data
In order to support our global network of parkrun events it is critical we understand who is participating. There are many reasons for this, from simple stuff like providing participants with information around how and when they have taken part, through to more complex challenges such as measuring the impact of our events on those communities most in need of increasing their physical activity levels.

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) guidelines require that all information we collect must be done so under a specific lawful basis. There are six clearly defined forms of lawful basis for processing information, and we categorise the majority of our data processing under three of those: Contract, Legitimate Interests and Consent.
Contract
When you register for parkrun we commit to providing you with the service of enabling you to walk, run, or volunteer at our events, for those events to be delivered to an appropriate standard, and for us to provide you with accurate records of your participation.

This lawful basis also includes any administrative or service-related emails, for example, to confirm that you have registered with us or taken part in one of our events, or to alert you of an update to this Privacy Policy. These therefore do not offer an option to unsubscribe as they are necessary to provide the Services you requested.
Legitimate Interests
Outside of your direct participation we also wish to develop the reach and impact of our events and as such have a requirement to process certain information with this aim. This includes things like analysing anonymised postcode data to assess levels of local engagement at specific events or across regions, or processing incident data in order to improve our health and safety provision.
Consent
Above and beyond simple participation as a walker, runner, or volunteer, there are a number of ways you can help us to ensure our events positively impact the health and happiness of their local communities, and remain free to participate in.

One of the best ways to support us in this way is by consenting to receive emails regarding things like milestone t-shirts, event profiles, offers, competitions and promotions from our partners, training tips, and more. We therefore provide the opportunity at registration, and via your profile, to opt in to these communications.

Due to GDPR requirement for providing consent, we do not process any data on children under the age of 13 if it would require consent as the lawful reason for processing. For this reason, children under the age of 13 do not have the option to opt in to the above emails.

  Note: Although extremely rare, there can be occasions where we are required to process information under one of the other three lawful bases: Legal Obligation, Vital Interest, Public Task.


2 | What Data We Collect
There are a number of ways that you are able to explicitly share data with us:


At registration we collect information about you that allows us to support your participation in our events. We use this information to create a profile for you on our database, to which we can connect walking, running, or volunteering instances that in turn track your progress toward various parkrun participation milestones. We also collect information around your activity levels and other relevant personal information that may help us support your participation more appropriately.
  

Using your profile you can update information such as emergency contact details, mobile number in order to receive participation notifications via SMS, email address, or home event.
  

By linking your parkrun account with a third-party account, such as by connecting your parkrun profile with Strava you can connect services that you use.
  

    From time-to-time we send out research surveys that allow us to develop an understanding of parkrun and its participants.
  

Partner surveys, sent out by us, help to support our sponsors and other stakeholders in understanding their level of connection with the parkrun communities they support.
  

Incident reports are compiled by our local volunteer teams in the event of an incident. Relevant data is collected by the volunteers and uploaded directly or via email to our secure online incident reporting system.
  

Cookies
When you visit our websites, cookies will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies and similar technologies work by assigning to your browser or device a unique number that has no meaning outside of parkrun. We use these technologies to personalise your experience and to assist in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your parkrun ID and password we save that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. To manage the collection of information through cookies or other equivalent technology you can use the settings on your browser or mobile device.
Log Files
The collection of information: Every time you connect to parkrun websites your IP (Internet Protocol) address registers on our servers. Your IP address reveals no information other than the number assigned to you. We do not use this technology to get any personal data against your knowledge or free will (i.e. automatically recording email addresses of visitors). Nor do we use it for any purpose other than to help us monitor traffic on our website, or (in case of criminal activity or misuse of our information) to cooperate with law enforcement.
Local Volunteer Event Teams
In order to support our local event teams’ requirement to manage their volunteers, process results, and record incidents, we created a dedicated online system, called WebFMS. This enables event teams to carry out their roles with regards the safe and appropriate management of their events, without the need for them to hold or have access to sensitive personal data of their participants. For example, they are able to email their volunteers through WebFMS without being able to see individual email addresses.
It is important to note however that due to the nature of our events, friendships form and as a result event teams are likely to also communicate directly with each other through platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, SMS or email.
Anonymity
In exceptional circumstances, such as for our participants within the custodial system, we allow/require participants to register under a pseudonym. Any questions on this process should be be directed to our support team.


3 | What Data We Share
Publicly Available Information
We do not offer privacy settings in relation to your walking, running, or volunteering participation, and as such our websites display your name, age category, gender, age grade, participation locations, and finish times. We do, in some cases, share (under the lawful basis of legitimate interest) this publicly-visible data with third parties such as the Power of 10 website (who, for example, aggregate results from running events across the UK).
Third-Party Connections
Across parkrun territories we offer a number of opportunities for our members to connect their parkrun accounts with other accounts in their name. This could be for the purposes of linking to activity tracking platforms, or sending activity data to incentivised wellness programmes. This can only happen at the request of the user, the specific data shared is clearly defined, and the integration can be stopped at any time by the user simply opting out.
Anonymised Participant Data
Our mission statement is to create a healthier and happier planet and, as a result, much of our internal work centres around understanding the health and wellbeing of our communities. As part of this we have an exclusive global research partnership with the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre (AWRC), a Department of Health and Social Care Funded research centre based in Sheffield, England. Under the lawful basis of Legitimate Interest, we pass anonymised & published participant data to the AWRC who are then able to support health-focused research utilising this data, out of which research articles may be published containing anonymised data. All research on the anonymised data, that is approved by the parkrun Research Board, will have achieved ethical approval through an independent research ethics board.
Personal Contact Details
We do not share our users’ personal contact details with any third parties. All communications sent to our database on behalf of our partners are sent directly by us.


4 | How We Contact You
The large majority of our outgoing communication, to the parkrun community, is via email. Sending an email to you is a form of data processing, and as such may only be carried out under a specific lawful basis.
Under the Lawful Basis of Fulfilling a Contract
In order to fulfil our obligation to you as a parkrunner, to ensure our events are delivered in a safe and appropriate manner, and to ensure the parkrun organisation is managed appropriately, there are some communications we send to everyone. The following communications fall into this category:


    Confirmation you have registered with us.
  

    Updates to key documents, such as this privacy policy.
  

    Confirmation that your participation (walking, running, or volunteering) has been recorded by the local event team.
  

    Notification that you have joined a parkrun milestone club and are eligible to claim any associated items such as t-shirts, wristbands, or certificates.
  

    For those who have volunteered at a parkrun event, a regular national volunteer update.
  

    For those who have signed up to volunteer at a specific parkrun event, emails from that event team relating to that volunteering instance.
  

Under the Lawful Basis of Legitimate Interest
There are some occasions where we may contact you as part of our mission to make the world healthier and happier. For example, where we write to people who’ve registered but not participated, with the aim of understanding why and then being able to create a more supportive environment. The following types of communications fall into this category:


    Questionnaires aimed at developing our understanding of who is participating.
  

    Emails sign-posting participants to peer-support groups we feel may be suitable based on information you have provided.
  

    Questionnaires for research aimed at understanding the effect of parkun on global health and wellbeing.
  

    Local event teams directly contacting specific parkrunners using the WebFMS platform.
  

You have a right to object to receiving these emails, to do that please contact us directly.
Under the Lawful Basis of Consent
Not only is our mission statement focussed on improving the health and happiness of our communities, but we have also made a commitment that participation in parkrun will be free, forever, for everyone. There are ways in which we rely on parkrunners to achieve both of those ambitions, some of which require us to be able to send certain communications. We therefore offer all parkrunners the chance to opt-in (at registration or via their profile) to receive regular updates from us and our partners.

Individual parkrunners can also opt in to receive local volunteer appeals from the events of their choice.

5 | How We Protect Your Information
We work extremely hard to apply appropriate security measures in order to protect your data from being accessed or disclosed without your permission, or lost. We have a relatively small staff team, who are regularly updated on good practice in data handling, all personal data is password protected and only available to those with a specific need for access.

In the event of a data breach we will notify you and any applicable regulator, where legally required to do so.

At local event level we ask our teams to support all participants (walkers, runners, and volunteers) using our secure online platform (WebFMS) and their official email account (which we have access to centrally). As such, the only personal information event teams hold on their participants is an email address if an email has previously been sent to the event email account. All event-team email accounts are password protected.

Whilst we understand that event teams will also hold files that include athlete ID barcode numbers of specific participants, this is publicly available information. Should a parkrunner request that their data be deleted from our servers, these barcode numbers will no longer be able to identify specific individuals.

Some event teams also use Facebook to communicate with participants, in these cases we retain admin control centrally and are able to control/remove access when required.


6 | Your rights to manage your data
Deleting Your Data
Should you wish, at any time, for us to delete your data then please contact us via support and we can enable this process. Please note that this is not something that can be undone and as such we would recommend downloading your historical results (see next section) before doing so.
Downloading Your Data
You are also free, at any time, to request a downloadable copy of all the data we hold on you. This would include details of all your walking, running, and volunteering instances and as such is something we particularly recommend prior to any request for us to delete your data. To do this please contact us via support.
