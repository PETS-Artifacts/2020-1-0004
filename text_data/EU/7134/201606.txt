We also store the details you provide to us during registration, which are needed to operate the parkrun site/service (eg to send you your results or for our event teams to identify you when you volunteer). We use this data internally and make copies of it for back-up purposes. We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
