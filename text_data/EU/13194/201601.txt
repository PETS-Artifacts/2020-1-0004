The Monkey takes user privacy pretty dang seriously. Our goal is to make PicMonkey a great experience. However, as much as we love you, we are not interested in knowing everything about you.
Here's the scoop in layman's terms
The collection, use and preservation of personal information by PicMonkey will only happen for making PicMonkey a better, faster, or more convenient for you. The disclosure of personal information will never occur without your explicit consent.
So, does PicMonkey use cookies?
Yes, PicMonkey does set cookies to make your experience better. No, you can't eat these cookies!  A cookie is actually a small data file that is transferred to your device. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from any website you visit. If you do this, it's possible that PicMonkey might not work as well.
Are the images I upload to PicMonkey public?
Nope. Negative. No siree bob.
Can anyone use my image?
No silly, you own your images! The copyright for the image remains with you even after you use PicMonkey. We will never use your image without your consent. For example, if we want to feature one of your public images on our blog, or use your photography on our site, the Monkey will contact you before ever publishing your work.
Does PicMonkey save email addresses?
PicMonkey will save your email address so we can keep you up to date. Other email addresses you associated with your personal account may also be stored.
Will any of my personal information be shared with 3rd parties?
No. If it were up to us, spammers would be put in a monkey barrel! If PicMonkey is ever acquired, we will provide notice before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. It's not our goal to be acquired, but we feel that it's prudent to be clear about your rights if it happens. Your ongoing support of PicMonkey will ensure that we will never have to sell to another company.
Will this privacy policy change?
As PicMonkey evolves, this privacy policy is likely to evolve with it. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice.
We also adhere to the US-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (ProTip: this has nothing to do with boats). If you want to see for yourself, please browse over to the US Department of Commerce's web site.
If you've got any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact us.

2.Some of the PicMonkey Services are supported by advertising revenue and may display advertisements and promotions, and you hereby agree that PicMonkey may place such advertising and promotions on the PicMonkey Services or on, about, or in conjunction with your Content. The manner, mode and extent of such advertising and promotions are subject to change without specific notice to you.
3.You represent and warrant that: (i) you own the Content uploaded by you on or through the PicMonkey Services, (ii) the uploading and use of your Content on or through the PicMonkey Services does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, intellectual property rights or any other rights of any person, and (iii) the uploading of your Content on the Site does not result in a breach of contract between you and a third party. You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, and any other monies owing any person by reason of Content you upload on or through the PicMonkey Services.
4.Limited License. PicMonkey grants you a non-exclusive license to use PicMonkey. These Terms of Service will also govern any upgrades that replace and/or supplement PicMonkey, unless such upgrades are accompanied by a separate license, in which case the terms of that license will govern. PicMonkey may be used to reproduce materials so long as such use is limited to reproduction of non-copyrighted materials, materials in which you own the copyright, or materials you are authorized or legally permitted to reproduce. Except as and only to the extent expressly permitted in these Terms of Service or by applicable law, you may not copy, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, modify, or create derivative works of PicMonkey or any part thereof.
5.The PicMonkey Services contain Content of PicMonkey ("PicMonkey Content"). PicMonkey Content is protected by copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other laws, and PicMonkey owns and retains all rights in the PicMonkey Content and the PicMonkey Services.

6.The PicMonkey Services contain Content of Users and other PicMonkey licensors.

Also, although PicMonkey will normally only delete Content that violates this Agreement, PicMonkey reserves the right to delete any Content for any reason, without prior notice. Deleted content may be stored by PicMonkey in order to comply with certain legal obligations and is not retrievable without a valid court order. Consequently, PicMonkey encourages you to maintain your own backup of your Content. In other words, PicMonkey is not a backup service. PicMonkey will not be liable to you for any modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the PicMonkey Services, or the loss of any Content.

You agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Seattle, Washington. You are responsible for complying with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, PicMonkey shall have the right to commence and prosecute any legal or equitable action or proceeding before any United States or non-United States court of competent jurisdiction to obtain injunctive or other relief in PicMonkey's sole discretion. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action by you arising out of or related to use of PicMonkey or the Website or the Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
