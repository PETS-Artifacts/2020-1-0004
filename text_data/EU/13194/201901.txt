10US ONLY: Disputes with company
10.1PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND PICMONKEY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
10.2This Section 10 is deemed to be a âwritten agreement to arbitrateâ pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and PicMonkey agree that we intend for this Section 10 to satisfy the âwritingâ requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement. 
10.3We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Use, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Websites or PicMonkey Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with PicMonkey, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to PicMonkey or that PicMonkey may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, âPicMonkey Transactions or Relationshipsâ), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Websites or PicMonkey Services, or engaging in any other PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
10.4We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using our Websites or PicMonkey Services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against PicMonkey, and any claim that PicMonkey may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, or any PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (âArbitrationâ) administered by JAMS or its successor (âJAMSâ) and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the âApplicable Rulesâ). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor (the âAAAâ) instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the âApplicable Rulesâ in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations (the "Minimum Standards") in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, PicMonkey agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that:
                
Single Arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and PicMonkey (the âArbitratorâ);
Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable;
Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and PicMonkey; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.
Governing Law. The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of Washington consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with Washington or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
No Class Relief. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or PicMonkeyâs individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
Written Award. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitratorâs complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an âAwardâ). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
Arbitration Costs. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PicMonkey will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
Reasonable Attorneyâs Fees. In the event you recover an Award greater than PicMonkeyâs last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award PicMonkeyâs reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneysâ fees associated with the Arbitration, but PicMonkey shall in all events bear its own attorneysâ fees; and
Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor PicMonkey shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Modification of Arbitration Clause with Notice. PicMonkey may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty days after PicMonkey has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.
Small Claims Matters are Excluded. No class relief or joinder of claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against PicMonkey in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such courtâs jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.


11Termination
11.1If you fail to comply with any of the provisions of these Terms of Use, PicMonkey, at its sole discretion, may: (i) terminate your PicMonkey account and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of termination; and/or (ii) preclude access to the PicMonkey Services (or any part thereof).

12.1PicMonkey Basic and Pro. To enjoy editing tools and features, you may purchase PicMonkey's Basic or Pro membership for a fee. In addition to the General Terms set out above for all PicMonkey Subscription users, PicMonkey Basic or Pro members will be subject to the following terms.
12.2PicMonkey Team Subscription. You may purchase three or more seats ("Seats") under one PicMonkey account ("Team Subscription"), as follows:
                
If you purchase a Team Subscription, you will become the "Team Admin." Team Admins may invite eligible individuals (or assign a Seat to herself) by assigning such person's email address to the Seat, via the account page. Team Admins may change the Seat occupant at any time. A Team Admin may also add additional Seats, with such Seats being charged immediately on a pro-rated basis under the current billing cycle.Â Last, a Team Owner may cancel Seats, subject to Section 13 (Cancellation and Refunds Policy). Otherwise, all Seats under a Team Subscription renew just like a normal PicMonkey Subscription.
A user assigned to a Seat ("Team Member") occupies the Seat until the Team Admin removes the Team Member, the Team Subscription expires, or the Team Member elects to leave. A Team Member can turn her Seat into a PicMonkey Subscription, by so electing and will pay for an individual PicMonkey Subscription at the next renewal cycle. Team Subscriptions are not eligible on a trial basis.Â  Please note that that current PicMonkey Subscription users cannot be added to a Team Subscription.


12.3Contracting. PicMonkey is under a legal obligation to supply the PicMonkey Services in accordance with the contract concluded between you and PicMonkey. A contract between PicMonkey and you for the purchase of PicMonkey Services is created as follows:
