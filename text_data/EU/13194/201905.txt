If PicMonkey is ever acquired, we will provide notice before any personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
We take all reasonable steps, as required by law, to ensure the safety, privacy and integrity of your personal information and, where appropriate, enter into contracts with such third parties to protect the privacy and integrity of such data and any information supplied.
Where is your information stored or transferred?
The personal information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), including the United States, for the purposes described above. To ensure that your personal information receives an adequate level of protection and is treated securely, we have put the appropriate safeguards in place to protect the privacy and integrity of such personal information when being transferred outside the EEA in the form of EU-approved Standard Contractual Clauses. These are standard clauses in our contracts with third parties situated in non-EEA countries to ensure that any personal information leaving the EEA will be transferred in compliance with EU data-protection law. Copies of our current Standard Contractual Clauses are available on request using the contact details listed above.
How long do we keep your information?
We will keep your personal information only for so long as is necessary to carry out the purposes set out above. It may be necessary to keep your personal information for longer in certain limited circumstances, including where we need it to comply with any legal obligations, including in relation to requests from legal or regulatory authorities or to defend legal claims. In any event, we will not keep your personal information longer than 7 years following your last transaction on the PicMonkey Services ("Data Retention Period").
If you delete your PicMonkey account, PicMonkey will only retain your name and profile image associated with any content you may have created through the Collaborations Feature. PicMonkey needs to keep this information so it can facilitate users' ability to establish their respective ownership rights in projects, as well as allow PicMonkey to better track and remove any infringing content or content that violates PicMonkey's Terms of Service. PicMonkey will not keep any other personal information belonging to you after you delete your PicMonkey account. Your name and profile image associated with your Collaborations Feature content will be retained in line with our Data Retention Period.  Following the expiration of our Data Retention Period, any edits made by you within the Collaborations Feature will be retained (for the benefit of other users of the relevant document) but anonymized.
What Rights Do I Have?
If you are located in the EEA, you have a right to obtain a copy of, and the right to rectify any inaccuracies in, the personal information we hold about you by making a request to us in writing. You also have the right to request erasure, restriction, portability or object to the processing of your personal information or not to be subject to a decision based on automated processing, including profiling. You should inform us of any changes to your personal information. Any requests made under this section can be made using the contact details set out above. If you wish to exercise any of your rights in this regard please contact us at legal@picmonkey.com. We will respond to your request in writing, or orally if requested, as soon as practicable and in any event not more than one month after receipt of your request.
However, these rights may not be exercised in certain circumstances, such as when the processing of your data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or for the exercise or defense of legal claims.
You have the right to lodge a complaint with the data protection supervisory authority in the country where you live if you are unhappy with how your personal information is being handled. The contact details of the Irish Data Protection Commission are below:

10US ONLY: Disputes with company
10.1PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND HOW CLAIMS THAT YOU AND PICMONKEY HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
10.2This Section 10 is deemed to be a "written agreement to arbitrate" pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and PicMonkey agree that we intend for this Section 10 to satisfy the "writing" requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act. This Section 10 can only be amended by mutual agreement. 
10.3We believe that arbitration is a faster, more convenient and less expensive way to resolve any disputes or disagreements that you may have with us. Therefore, pursuant to these Terms of Use, if you have any dispute or disagreement with us regarding (i) your use of or interaction with the Websites or PicMonkey Services, (ii) any purchases or other transactions or relationships with PicMonkey, or (iii) any data or information you may provide to PicMonkey or that PicMonkey may gather in connection with such use, interaction or transaction (collectively, "PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships"), you will not have the right to pursue a claim in court, or have a jury decide the claim and you will not have the right to bring or participate in any class action or similar proceeding in court or in arbitration. By using or interacting with the Websites or PicMonkey Services, or engaging in any other PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships with us, you agree to binding arbitration as provided below.
10.4We will make every reasonable effort to informally resolve any complaints, disputes, or disagreements that you may have with us. If those efforts fail, by using our Websites or PicMonkey Services, you agree that any complaint, dispute, or disagreement you may have against PicMonkey, and any claim that PicMonkey may have against you, arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with these Terms of Use, our Privacy Policy, or any PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration ("Arbitration") administered by JAMS or its successor ("JAMS") and conducted in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules And Procedures in effect at the time the Arbitration is initiated or, if the amount in controversy exceeds $100,000, in accordance with the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules And Procedures then in effect (respectively, the "Applicable Rules"). The Applicable Rules can be found at www.jamsadr.com. If JAMS is no longer in existence, the Arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association or its successor ("AAA") instead, and conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules in effect at that time (which shall be the "Applicable Rules" in such circumstances). If JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) at the time the arbitration is filed has Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness for Consumer Arbitrations ("Minimum Standards") in effect which would be applicable to the matter in dispute, PicMonkey agrees to provide the benefit of such Minimum Standards to you to the extent they are more favorable than the comparable arbitration provisions set forth in this Section, provided, however, that in no event may such Minimum Standards contravene or restrict the application of subpart (e) or (i) below. Furthermore, this Section shall not prevent any party from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. You further agree that:
                
Single Arbitrator. The Arbitration shall be conducted before a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the Applicable Rules or by mutual agreement between you and PicMonkey ("Arbitrator");
Arbitrator Will Interpret This Agreement. The Arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the validity, interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use and/or these arbitration provisions in this Section hereof, including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable;
Location of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by JAMS (or, if applicable, AAA) pursuant to the Applicable Rules (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business); or (ii) at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and PicMonkey; or (iii) at your election, if the only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $10,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission.
Governing Law. The Arbitrator (i) shall apply internal laws of the State of Washington consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, or, to the extent (if any) that federal law prevails, shall apply the law of the U.S., irrespective of any conflict of law principles; (ii) shall entertain any motion to dismiss, motion to strike, motion for judgment on the pleadings, motion for complete or partial summary judgment, motion for summary adjudication, or any other dispositive motion consistent with Washington or federal rules of procedure, as applicable; (iii) shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; and (iv) shall have authority to award any form of legal or equitable relief;
No Class Relief. The Arbitration can resolve only your and/or PicMonkey’s individual claims, and the Arbitrator shall have no authority to entertain or arbitrate any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated;
Written Award. The Arbitrator shall issue a written award supported by a statement of decision setting forth the Arbitrator’s complete determination of the dispute and the factual findings and legal conclusions relevant to it (an "Award"). Judgment upon the Award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof or having jurisdiction over the relevant party or its assets;
Arbitration Costs. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the costs of Arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, PicMonkey will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith;
Reasonable Attorney’s Fees. In the event you recover an Award greater than PicMonkey’s last written settlement offer, the Arbitrator shall also have the right to include in the Award PicMonkey’s reimbursement of your reasonable and actual out-of-pocket attorneys’ fees associated with the Arbitration, but PicMonkey shall in all events bear its own attorneys’ fees; and
Interpretation and Enforcement of Arbitration Clause. With the exception of subpart (e) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Applicable Rules, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (e) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor PicMonkey shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute, and must instead bring any claims in a court of competent jurisdiction.
Modification of Arbitration Clause with Notice. PicMonkey may modify these arbitration provisions, but such modifications shall only become effective thirty days after PicMonkey has given notice of such modifications and only on a prospective basis for claims arising from PicMonkey Transactions or Relationships occurring after the effective date of such notification.
Small Claims Matters are Excluded. No class relief or joinder of claims. Notwithstanding the foregoing arbitration provisions, at your option, you may bring any claim you have against PicMonkey in your local small claims court within the U.S., if your claim is within such court’s jurisdictional limit; provided that such court does not have the authority to entertain any claims on a class or representative basis, or to consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated in such proceeding.
