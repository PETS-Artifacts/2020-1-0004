General
CORUS respects your privacy and believes the best way to serve you on the Internet is with honesty, accountability and adherence to legal standards. We are sensitive to the issue of privacy and have structured our online activities to maximize your control over the disclosure of your own Personal Information. This Site is for information purposes only and the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy relate specifically to this Site and do not apply to websites operated by subsidiary and holding companies of CORUS, or other third parties, which have their own terms of use and privacy policies. Please read the respective sites’ terms and policies when accessing those sites. This Privacy Policy Statement supplements our general Terms of Use, which you must also read. By using our website (the “Site”), you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and by the Terms of Use. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting revisions to the Site, and your continued use of the Site indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, you should check the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy from time to time to keep informed of such amendments, and, if you do not agree to the terms of this or any revised policy, please exit the Site immediately.

CORUS only collects Personal Information where it is voluntarily provided by the individual in question.
