Betfair will process your Personal Information in order to allow you access and make use of our website, to allow you to participate in the services offered, to administer your account, to maintain our accounts and records, to enable us to comply with any legal or regulatory requirements, to allow quicker account registration should you open a betting account with another company within the Group (for example, if you were to open an account with Paddy Power, we could use the verification documents submitted to Betfair to comply with our legal and regulatory requirements), to monitor website usage levels and the quality of the service we provide and to inform you, from time to time, about products and services that we consider may interest you and for related purposes.

Those bodies may then use your Personal Information to investigate and act on any such breaches in accordance with their procedures.
