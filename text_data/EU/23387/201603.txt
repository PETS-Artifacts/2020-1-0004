FocusVision Privacy Policy
FocusVision Worldwide, and its subsidiaries, collectively (“FVW”) are committed to protecting your privacy.
Please read the FVW Privacy Statement to understand how your personal information will be treated by both FVW and its subsidiaries.
Collection of Your Personal Information
In order to schedule and access some FVW services, we may require personal information including your name, email address, mailing address and phone number. This information may be provided by you directly or another designated by you to schedule or complete a service. For example: When you log in to view a scheduled FVW transmission project or recording, you will be asked to supply us with your name, email address, phone number and company name. This information is referred to as your personal login information (PLI). Information we obtain during this login process is treated differently than personal information we obtain via other means as noted below. We may also collect information about your visits to our website, including the pages you view, the links you click and other actions taken in connection with our site and services. We also collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Website addresses. When you receive newsletters or promotional email from FVW, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused email communications or other information. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to associate your activity while on our website with your IP address in order to improve our site and services.
Use of Your Personal Login Information (PLI)
FVW collects and uses your personal login information, provided to us during the login process, solely to deliver the services you have requested, for security purposes and to provide you with important communications such as product improvements and technical service issues.
Use of Your Personal Information other than PLI
FVW also collects and uses personal information provided to us during service scheduling or by other means including third party providers to deliver important information on our services and complete transactions you request. These uses may also include making our site or services easier to use by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information; conducting research and analysis to improve our products, services and technologies; and displaying information that is customized to your preferences. We also use your personal information to communicate directly with you. We may send important communications such as service and security announcements, product improvements and technical service issues. We may also occasionally send you product surveys or promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from FVW. All personal information collected by FVW, information collected during login and otherwise, is stored in a secure manner (see Security of your Personal Information below) at our U.S. headquarters in Stamford, CT. By using a FVW site or service, you acknowledge that your information may be stored outside of your country.
Sharing of Your Personal Login Information (PLI)
Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal login information outside of FVW (or it’s subsidiaries) without your consent.
Sharing of Your Personal Information other than PLI
We may disclose personal information that FVW and/or its subsidiaries collect or you provide:

To our subsidiaries and affiliates.
To contractors, service providers and other third parties we use to support our business ( and who are bound by contractual obligations to keep personal information confidential and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them).
To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution or other sale or transfer of some or all of FVW’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by FVW about our users is among the assets transferred.
For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
With your consent.
To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
To protect and defend the rights or property of FVW (including the enforcement of our agreements).
To act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of FVW services or members of the public. We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings or for research purposes. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

Children under the Age of 13
Our surveys are not intended for children under 13 years of age, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at the address provided below.
Accessing Your Personal Information
You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to login with information provided by FVW.
Communication Preferences
You can stop the delivery of future promotional email from FVW sites and services by following the specific instructions in the email you receive. You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the communications you receive from FVW by visiting and signing into the following page on our website: http://www.focusvision.com/clientws/web_clientlog.asp. In order to help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to login with information provided by FVW.
Security of Your Personal Information
FVW is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. Security technologies and procedures are employed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. Personal information is stored on computer servers with limited access, located in secured facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. If a password is provided to help protect your projects and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
Where applicable, EU personal data controlled by the Customer, which FVW processes on the Customer’s behalf, shall be processed and stored by FVW in data centers located within the EU territory. For the purpose of fulfilling specific service needs requested by the Customer (e.g. system support requests), it may be necessary for FVW’s service personnel located outside of the EU to access the Customer controlled personal data located in the EU insofar as such access is needed for the performance of the task requested by the Customer. If accessing Customer controlled personal data from outside of the EU for the purposes defined above is regarded a data transfer, Customer hereby permits FVW to perform any such transfer of Customer controlled personal data on Customer’s behalf.
Safe Harbor Policy
FVW complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. FVW has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between the policies in this privacy policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern.

Use of Cookies
FVW uses “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services more easily and to help personalize your online experience. A “cookie” is a set of data that a web server stores on your computer that enables the server to recognize your computer. Cookies enable websites to “remember” your entries as you move from page to page, or when you revisit the site from time to time using the same computer. The data set that makes up a cookie will typically not have any meaning to anyone other than the party that placed the cookie. A cookie cannot retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses. Two different types of cookies are used in connection with our website: “Session cookies” track the user’s progression through our sites in a single visit. These cookies enable us to remember things as the user progresses from one page to another. With most Internet browsers, session cookies are either deleted or rendered inaccessible to us and our agents as soon as the user closes his or her browser. “Persistent cookies” allow us to remember a user at the user’s next visit. Persistent cookies are neither automatically erased nor rendered inaccessible upon closing the user’s browser, although persistent cookies will typically “expire” after some number of years. Upon expiration, such cookies may be deleted by the user’s browser or rendered inaccessible to us. (If you do not want these cookies to remain on your computer, you can erase them through use of your browser settings.) Both session and persistent cookies may also be used in connection with html email sent by us. Your browser or other software you install may permit you to restrict the use of session cookies, persistent cookies or all cookies. If you elect to not permit the use of persistent cookies only, you may enjoy the full functionality of our website; however, if you do so, you will need to re-enter some data upon your return visit or during the login process.
Use of Web Beacons
FVW Web pages may contain electronic images known as “pixel tags”, “web beacons” or other technologies (collectively, “web beacons”). Web beacons are used to collect non-personally identifiable data and to assist in delivering cookies on our site and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver services. We may include Web beacons in promotional email messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.

Changes to This Privacy Statement
We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the “last updated” date at the top of this statement. If there are material changes to how FVW will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We suggest you periodically review this statement to be informed of how FVW is protecting your information.
