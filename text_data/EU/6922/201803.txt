Privacy and Security PolicyLast updated: September 19, 2017IntroductionShop smarter, together.As users of the internet, we care about privacy just like you. And as good human beings, we think you deserve to know exactly what you can expect from the Honey experience.  So before we get to the privacy policy, we'd first like to tell you our data and privacy philosophy in simple language. We think you’ll like our approach.The easy stuff first. We promise not to sell ANY of your personally identifiable data. Ever. We also promise that we do not collect any data that is not necessary to save you time and money. It’s that simple.Honey's mission is to find new ways to save people time and money. We believe the best way to achieve this mission is to build a community of people and empower them with data-driven shopping tools.We built Honey because we think the way e-commerce works today doesn’t work. Everyone shops in isolation and wastes time hunting around on their own for good deals. When someone tries to use a promo code and it doesn't work, why does everyone else on the internet have to repeat this futile exercise? Or when someone notices a huge price drop on an item, why is it so hard for other shoppers to get in on the action?When people come together and form a community like Honey, that’s when the magic happens. As residents of the traffic Thunderdome that is Los Angeles, our favorite example of this community network approach is Waze. Waze created a network out of the millions of people who used to navigate their daily commutes in isolation. With Waze, every member contributes information about their traffic conditions back to the network and Waze is able to help everyone else navigate around congested areas. The network has made GPS infinitely more useful and traffic more manageable. Everybody wins.We are applying this community network concept to e-commerce because when online shoppers come together and share their shopping journey, everyone can make better purchase decisions. Similar to Waze, our members contribute real-time information back to the Honey network and help millions of others in the process. Want to know what promo codes work? Sure, someone just tested the codes with Honey five minutes ago. Want to see when a product you’re interested in goes on sale? Another Honey member is helping us update the price right now. When shoppers hunt for deals in packs, rather than on their own, everyone saves time and money. Everybody wins.We understand this community network approach isn’t for everyone and that’s okay. We think the vast majority of our members will see the value of sharing things like successful promo codes and price drops with each other and will learn first-hand how it helps everyone save a lot of time and a big pot of Honey. But, it’s up to you, and we give you the choice to opt out at any time.Our stance on privacy is simple: We will be transparent with what data we collect and how we use it to save you time and money, and you can decide if you’re good with that.If this sounds good, then let’s start shopping smarter, together.George RuanCo-Founder and CEO, HoneyP.S. If you have any questions or comments, we're always listening at privacy@joinhoney.com.The Privacy PolicyThis privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs your use of the websites and software applications and other online services (collectively the “Service”) provided by Honey Science Corporation (“Honey” or “we”).

We may also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.We do not automatically collect personally identifiable information, but we may tie personally identifiable information with the automatically collected information using the above tools or information collected from other sources.  In such cases, we will NOT share any information with third parties that ties your Automatically Collected Information with your personally identifiable information except as set forth in the section below titled “Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Service?”Where possible we work to make settings available to you as a member to control which features are available and the information required for us to provide each.What information does the Service NOT obtain?Your privacy and security is very important to us.

In some cases your eligibility for some of these Exclusive Offers is based in whole or in part upon data we or our merchant partners collect. When Honey User Provided or Automatically Collected Information is used for Exclusive Offer qualification no personally identifying information is ever transferred to the merchant partner.In some cases an action is required by you in order to claim an Exclusive Offer such as by clicking on a “claim” button presented in our software. Claiming an offer does not guarantee it will be available when you check out as there may be additional requirements from our merchant partner to successfully redeem an offer, including tracking your purchase through to delivery. When you claim an offer we will make a commercially reasonable effort to ensure that the offer remains available but do not make any specific guarantees as we and our merchant partners rely on numerous third party systems employing a mix of technologies including cookies to track results. Your use of other software including adblockers or other affiliate or offer programs provided by other third parties can also interfere with this tracking in which case you may no longer be eligible for the Exclusive Offer. If you encounter problems redeeming an offer please contact us at info@joinhoney.com and we will try to help resolve your problem.What are my opt-out rights?You can stop all collection of information by the Service easily by uninstalling the Service and no longer visiting our website.
