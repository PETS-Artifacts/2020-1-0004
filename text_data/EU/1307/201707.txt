Use of your Personal Information
USCCB collects and uses your personal information to operate the USCCB Web site and deliver the services you have requested. USCCB also uses your personally identifiable information to inform you of other areas of interest or services available from USCCB and its affiliates. USCCB may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.
USCCB does not sell, rent or lease its member lists to third parties. USCCB may share data {personal information/information automatically collected (see above)} with some of its vendors which perform communications or registration functions to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. USCCB makes efforts to inform all such third parties that USCCB does not intend that they use your personal information except to provide their services to USCCB.
USCCB keeps track of the Web sites and pages our member's visit, in order to determine what USCCB services are the most popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising within USCCB to members whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area.
USCCB's Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on USCCB or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of USCCB; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of USCCB, or the public.
Use of Cookies
The USCCB Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize USCCB pages, or register with USCCB site or services, a cookie helps USCCB to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same USCCB Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the USCCB features that you customized.
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the USCCB services or Web sites you visit.
Security of your Personal Information
USCCB makes standard business efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.
Changes to this Statement
USCCB will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect organizational and customer feedback. USCCB encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how USCCB is protecting your information.
