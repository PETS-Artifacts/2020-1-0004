We collect the majority of personal data directly from you.
                    We may also collect certain information from other users, for example, agents providing details of candidates or users recommending a friend (see paragraph 3 above).   Other information about you, eg your previous roles or productions, may be collected from publicly available sources.
                
Where we collect personal data from you relating to other individuals (such as your staff or, if you are an agent, your candidates whom you represent), it is your responsibility to ensure such individuals are aware of that their details are being disclosed to and processed by us (unless this is not required in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 and other relevant legislation).
                


We only collect or process sensitive personal data where directly relevant or incidental to the provision of our Services, for example where:
                

your profile or application for a job (including text, photos and other images of you) reveals racial or ethnic origin; 
steps taken to  monitor or ensure non-discrimination in the provision of our Services involves the use of sensitive personal data; and/or
actions taken to prevent or detect of illegal activities give rise to the processing of actual or alleged offences.



Personal data within your profile, or otherwise submitted by you as content for the Sites, may be accessed by other users in accordance with the Services provided to them.  Whilst we seek to ensure all users agree to our terms of service, we are not responsible for the use or misuse of your personal data by other users (including, by way of example, any misuse of a candidate’s personal data by casting professionals, film-makers or other employers).
                
However, you may report to us if you experience any misuse of your personal data by any other user or third party in relation to our Sites or Services.   We shall, at your expense, reasonably co-operate with you in enforcing our contractual terms against other users who have misused your personal data.

any purchaser or (on terms of confidentiality) likely purchaser of our business; and
other third parties where required or permitted by law.



Your personal data is stored in electronic and physical records maintained by us and/or our service providers.
