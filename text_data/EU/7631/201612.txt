We may process data including the following personal information about you, where supplied: Name, gender, date of birth, address(es), email, telephone number(s), information pertaining to disability and ethnicity, IP address, photographs, video and audio clips and career history.
Please note, that as many of our Services are primarily promotional tools, personal data included in these public profiles may be accessible by other Spotlight users and/or the public via wide circulation or redistribution, and via our historical archives. Therefore you should never include any personal data on your profile that you would wish to remain private.
How will we use your personal information?
We (or third party data processors acting on our behalf) may collect, store, use and share your personal information for the following purposes:

to provide you with the Spotlight Services, including making your public profile information available to other users of the Services,
to fulfil orders for products or Services (including recognising returning members, returning customers and previous member applicants),
to answer your enquiries or otherwise communicate with you,
to vet your professional background, but only when you are joining as a Spotlight Member/ Spotlight Casting Subscriber or purchasing a restricted access product,
internal record keeping,
to administer the Spotlight Card scheme,
to notify you of other products and/or services that we think will be of interest to you (you can unsubscribe from these communications at any time),
to improve our products and services,
to verify your identity,
for market research and analysis,
to customise our site to your interests, and
to facilitate the historical archiving of all Spotlight public profiles/titles both in print and digital formats.

In addition to the above, we may disclose your personal data to carefully selected and trusted third parties in the following circumstances:

subcontractors assisting us in providing our service to our users,
third parties who provide service enhancements or additional functionality to our users related to how they use our services. See below under 'Enhanced or additional functionality' for more information and examples,
third parties who are involved in furthering research and technology in areas connected with our service. See below under 'Research' for more information and examples,
complying with the law, or to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our customers or other third parties,
if we acquire any new business, and/or sell all or part of our business, and
third party payment service providers.

Wherever possible only information contained within your public profile would be released to such third parties.
The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in certain circumstances. For example, if we contract with service providers based outside the EEA, or if any of our servers are at any time based outside the EEA (including 'cloud' service provision). Where we would have to disclose your personal information to third parties, in any circumstances, we will always take all appropriate steps to ensure that such third parties are responsible and trusted and that your personal information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to UK Data Protection standards or equivalent.
Enhanced or additional functionality
In order to facilitate certain users of Spotlight with their workflow management processes or other functionality, Spotlight may from time to time provide or authorise the use of certain third party software or applications to facilitate additional off-site access to the professional materials and content otherwise available via the Services. An example of this would be third party tools used by Agents to administer their client submissions to casting services alongside diary management etc. Such third party packages or systems should only be used subject to the written approval of Spotlight. You acknowledge that your personal information may be used in this way. Please note however that Spotlight does not endorse and is therefore not responsible for any such third party packages or systems, and Spotlight will not be liable for any loss of information, materials, data or otherwise that may occur due to the use of your information within them.
Research
We are constantly looking for new ways to change and upgrade our Services and functionality. This may involve partnering with selected and trusted research organisations and technology providers to contribute to their research and innovation projects. Often the most innovative developments come from other industries or fields of research outside of our own, and the outputs of the research may have a broader application beyond the improvements from which we directly benefit. As part of this research our trusted partners may be given access to our systems and data and/or be provided with copies of our data, including member photos, video and audio clips, and other professional information from their public profile. In all such circumstances our partners' access to and use of this information will be strictly limited to specific research projects that may include benefits for Spotlight and our Services to you, and will be under secure, confidential, temporary conditions, and closed testing environments. Under no circumstances will this information be used for any commercial or live operational activity, other than to develop and test the specific technology and functionality, without your prior consent.
Website Payments
We will retain payment details briefly (the duration of time it takes to complete each transaction) whilst purchases are made through our online shop. Payment card details are not stored on our servers beyond this.
Our secure socket layer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all personal information including credit card numbers, names and addresses. This encryption has the objective of ensuring that nothing can be read as it travels over the Internet to our chosen fully PCI DSS compliant payment service providers www.sagepay.com and https://worldpay.com/ and https://gocardless.com/ for processing.
If you experience any payment problems when placing an order via our Site, we advise you to resubmit your payment details. If your payment still fails, please contact your card issuer, to ensure there are no problems with your account, before contacting our customer services team.

An IP address is a number which is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you access the internet. When you access the Spotlight site we will log your IP address. We generally only use IP addresses to analyse trends, administer our website, track general user movements and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, or where investigating possible criminal activity. However, we do link IP addresses to other information which could identify the user, for instance when assessing applications from new, re-joining and renewing members to ensure that they are provided with legal 'cooling off periods' where necessary. They will also be used to ascertain where members may be attempting to seek extended free periods on the Spotlight website by the misuse of our 'cooling off periods' or refund policy (see Terms & Conditions). The IP information gathered for this purpose will only be used to 'flag up' possible misuse to Spotlight staff members.
