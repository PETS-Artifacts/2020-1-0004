But wait!What about 3rd party scripts?
Some 3rd party scripts will need a slight tweak so that they don't get run when they're not supposed to.
        For any level dependant <script type="text/javascript"> tag you'll need to:
        
change it's type to text/plain instead of text/javascript
add a cookieconsent-level attribute to it, who's value is the id of the level it's dependant on

Let's say you've got a level with id 'tracking' and you had a script that should run only when the tracking level is enabled.
        Instead of having
        <script type="text/javascript">
        ... you would change it to ...
        <script type="text/plain" 
	cookieconsent-level="tracking">
