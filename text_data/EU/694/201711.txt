Information We Collect and How We Use ItPersonal Information that You Provide Us Actively When you fill out registration forms, submit your CV or provide us with other personal information actively, you will know what personal information we are collecting, processing and/ or using because you are actively submitting it.

Web Beacons and Log Files. We use "web beacons" (also known as Internet tags, pixel tags, tracking pixels, and clear GIFs) on our websites and those of certain of our job posting clients. These web beacons allow us and third parties to collect information such as the IP address of the device, the URL of the web page, the time the page was viewed, the type of browser used, and any additional information in cookies that may have been set by the third party. The information is typically collected in log files, which generally track traffic on our websites.

The information also is used for analytical purposes and to manage technical issues that may arise. Cookies. We also collect, process and/or use information using cookies or similar technologies to help us identify you when you visit the Glassdoor Website and we may share cookies with third-party advertisers or advertising networks to serve you relevant, targeted ads unless you’ve opted out from such sharing.

Do Not Track Signals We do not currently respond to 'do not track' signals and similar settings or mechanisms. When you use the Glassdoor Website, we try to provide a customised experience. How We Use Information/Purposes We may use the information we collect:  to provide you with personalised content, services offered by Glassdoor as well as promotional content and services;  to moderate and display the employer reviews, interview reviews, salary reports and other content you have submitted for the benefit of our other users;  to customise and improve the features, performance, and support of the site;  to show you relevant information, if you connect to the Glassdoor Website through a Social Networking Site, from your Social Networking Site friends and connections, and to allow you to share job and profile information with them;  to provide relevant advertising, including interest-based advertising from us and third parties, which may mean that we share non-personally identifiable information, such as your job title, to third-party advertisers;  to provide recruiting services to employers;  for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and service improvement;  to communicate with you regarding our services;  to analyse use of the Glassdoor Website and improve the Glassdoor Website;  to create aggregate and statistical data that does not identify you individually and that we can commercialise;  for other purposes that you separately authorise as you interact with Glassdoor.  When you set up an individual user account on Glassdoor, we create a member profile (a "Profile") for you that will include personal information you provide. We will update your Profile with information we extract from resumes you upload on Glassdoor. You may permit us to share information in your Profile with prospective employer, recruiters and others. Subject to visibility settings that you control, subscribers to services we may introduce will be able to view information in your Profile. Because your anonymity on Glassdoor is important, your Profile does not include or link to information about the reviews or salary information you submit to Glassdoor.  How We Share Information We do not disclose your individual account or usage data to third parties, except as follows:  With your consent;  We use affiliated and unaffiliated service providers all over the world that help us deliver our service and run our business subject to strict confidentiality agreements. (for example, if you enter credit card information on the Glassdoor Website in connection with a purchase, in most cases that information is sent directly from your browser to the third-party service provider we use to manage credit card processing and we do not store it on our servers. The service provider is not permitted to use the information you provide except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on our behalf. The exceptions to the foregoing are limited to employers and individuals which purchase select products from Glassdoor by entering credit card information into the Glassdoor Website. That information is stored in our secure accounting software separate from all of our other user and customer data); These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us;  We share aggregated usage statistics that cannot be used to identify you individually;  We will disclose data if we believe in good faith such disclosure is necessary (1) to comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants or legal process served on us; (2) to enforce our Glassdoor Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; (3) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (4) as we otherwise deem necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of us, the users of our services, or third parties. Our general procedure with respect to civil subpoenas or properly-served demands requesting user data is to require a court order, binding on Glassdoor before we release such information;  In a reorganisation or sale of our company or assets, your data may be transferred, subject to the acquirer accepting the commitments made in this Privacy and Cookie Policy and compliance with applicable law;  If you apply for a particular job through the Glassdoor Website, we will disclose your personal information to the employer to whom you apply and any vendors they are working with to process your application;  We may invite you to include your CV or other information in more generally available formats and then offer third-parties the right to view this information, subject to visibility settings you control;  We may share certain information that does not identify you personally, but which is unique to your use of the Glassdoor Website, such as job titles that you have entered at the time of registration or on your profile. When we share such information, we do not link job titles with your name when we provide this information to others, such as advertisers, recruiters or employers.

The provision of your data via Cookies is voluntary. The use of Cookies may include the collection, processing and/or use of personal data in countries outside the European Economic Area that do not provide the same level of data protection as in your country. What types of Cookies do we use? We use two types of Cookies on the Glassdoor Website: "session cookies" and "persistent cookies." Session Cookies are temporary Cookies that remain on your device until you leave the Glassdoor Website. A persistent Cookie remains on your device for much longer until you manually delete it (how long the Cookie remains will depend on the duration or "lifetime" of the specific Cookie and your browser settings). What are Cookies used for? Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Glassdoor Website, such as your browser type, search preferences, job titles, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use. With the exception of an identifier Cookie that we associate with registered accounts to prevent fraud by Glassdoor members, Cookies may link to certain unique information such as the job titles that you entered at time of registration or on your profile, but this is not linked to your name.  We use Cookies for things like: Authentication We use Cookies to help us determine whether or not you've signed in to the Glassdoor Website and to keep you signed in during visits as you access different pages. Security We use Cookies to enable and support security features, prevent fraud, and protect your data from unauthorised access.

Advertising We use Cookies to deliver, evaluate and improve advertising, such as by using information about you to provide relevant advertising both on and off the Glassdoor Website. Our partners may use a cookie to determine whether you've already been shown an advert or how it performed, or provide us with information about how you interacted with an advert. Analytics and Performance We use Cookies to analyse how our visitors use the Glassdoor Website and to monitor site performance. These Cookies help us to identify and fix errors, understand and improve services, research and test out different features, and monitor how our visitors reach our sites. Ad Choices and Managing Cookies Glassdoor works with several third parties to provide you with personalised, interest-based advertising. We may target adverts to you on and off the Glassdoor Website using:  Cookies (both on and off the Glassdoor Website) and IP address;  Mobile device location information, to the extent you have enabled location tracking on your device;  Member-provided profile information;  Your use of the Glassdoor Website (for example, your Glassdoor Website search history); and  Information from third-parties (including advertising partners, publishers, and data aggregators) which we use to help deliver relevant adverts to you.  We work with third parties, such as Google Analytics, to provide analytics services that may use the Cookies set on your device to measure the performance of advertising and track traffic to Glassdoor generally. In addition, we have implemented Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting, which categorises cookie information so that we and third-party service providers can better deliver advertisements that are relevant and useful to you on the Glassdoor Website and various websites across the internet. You may opt out of tracking by Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting services by visiting Google Ads Settings or by downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on.  You may be able to opt out of other third-party advertiser and ad network placement of Cookies or targeted advertising by visiting the following links: Network Advertising Initiative; Digital Advertising Alliance; European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (for users in the EU); The Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada  (for users in Canada); or you can follow opt-out instructions of the individual advertising networks, analytics providers and other advertising third parties we work with listed here. You will continue to receive generic adverts by companies not listed with these opt-out tools.  You may also be able to disable placement of some (but not all) Cookies by setting your browser to decline cookies, though this may worsen your user experience. Additionally you can also control, manage and/or delete cookies via your browser settings. A useful resource for information about deleting and controlling cookies can be found at AboutCookies.org.  If you enable location data for the mobile version of the Glassdoor Website (including any version installed as a native application), we may use your location data to serve you geo-targeted adverts and offers for businesses or employers that are local to you. In such instances, we do not share your location with the advertiser or advertising network; rather, we provide the advertiser or advertising network with a means to push adverts through to users located in certain areas or postal codes. You may disable location services at any time in your device privacy settings or the Glassdoor native app settings. Please note: if adverts or other features on the Glassdoor Website are provided by third parties, those parties also may set and use their own Cookies that are subject to those third parties' privacy notices and policies. Glassdoor does not have access to, or control over, these Cookies.

If we detect fraudulent activity, we remove the job posting from the Glassdoor Website. However, fraudulent job postings can sometimes appear and we urge you to exercise caution in your job search. Please consider the following tips when conducting your search:  Do not send money to a prospective employer.  Do not give out personal or financial account information to a new employer via email.  Do not cash checks or transfer funds for your employer.  Beware of job postings that ask you to send your CV to a free email service address (e.g gmail, yahoo, etc).  Do not include sensitive information like your National Insurance number in your CV.  Beware of job listings with spelling errors and bad grammar.  If something sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  Do your homework. Be sure to research any job opportunity that interests you.  If you see a suspicious job posting, please contact us here. If you think you have been the victim of fraud, immediately report the fraud to your local police and contact Glassdoor. Privacy of Minors. The Glassdoor Website is not intended for minors.
