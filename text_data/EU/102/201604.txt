Privacy Policy   
            
            AIR MALTA web-based services are brought to you by Malta's national carrier. We have built our business on the strength of the quality of our service and we therefore feel responsible for ensuring that the privacy of our users is appropriately protected at all times. 

In setting up our privacy policy, our goal was to comply with internationally respected standards such as those established by the Council of Europe's Convention on data protection (1981) as well as the EU Data Protection Directive (EU/46/95). In complying with these standards, AIR MALTA pledges our customers to collect only that personal information that we require for the technical and commercial operation of our activities to inform you when we collect personal information to inform you of the specific purpose for collecting this information not later than the moment of collection to use your personal information fairly and lawfully for the specified purposes and only for these purposes to give you access to your personal information kept by AIR MALTA to keep your personal information secure using both technical and organisational measures not to pass on your personal information to anybody unless you have specifically consented that we can so communicate your information. We will only store your personal information for the length of time required for the purpose for which it is collected.


Privacy & Personal Information

Personal information is defined as being any information which can be linked to an identified or identifiable individual. Quite simply, if any information can be linked to you it becomes personal information and we therefore take great care when collecting and processing such information in order to protect the privacy of our users.

Anonymity

When you visit AIR MALTA you may use many services without telling us who you are. Thus, unless you request a service that requires your personal details, you may use our services anonymously. However we may place a cookie on your PC to enable us to keep statistical track of our audience and build trends on usage. More details on how we use cookies can be found in this document.


Collecting your Personal Information

When you register, and in any visit subsequent to registration, we collect your information in two main ways: by asking you directly when you wish to use certain services e.g. e-mail. During the registration process we require you to complete certain fields, request that you complete other fields and ask you to select a username and password so that we have sufficient minimum information necessary to provide our services to you; by tracking your visit to our site and your preferences when accessing various parts (e.g. if you access our business travel or Winter sports sections we can reasonably assume that you are interested in such subjects). By learning more about your preferences we can better customise your use of our services as well as provide direct advertising of products and services in which you may be interested. One way of tracking your visits is through the use of "cookies" about which you may find more details below.

Fair and Lawful Purposes for Collecting your Information
We collect your personal information for four main purposes: 

Operational - in order to be able to provide the right service you require which may depend on the hardware & software installed in your home or office 

Selective information channelling - in order to know which news or other information you prefer to read first, thus saving you time Direct marketing and advertising - bringing you information about products and services which may be of interest to you. Enable you to participate in special offers, contests/competition. 

Using your Information 

AIR MALTA uses your personal information to:

Select the news and information which it knows you are normally interested in so that this will appear first next time you log on
Know your preferences and direct advertising for products and services in which you may be interested. We do this by deciding which advertising banners and displays you get to see by sending you e-mails about a specific offer. In this way we can support the services we offer you without revealing your personal information to those suppliers who may wish to promote their products and services. This means that we do NOT need to give your personal information to suppliers and sponsors. Instead they tell us what they wish to promote and the categories of people they would like to reach and then only WE (i.e. AIR MALTA) know whom we need to target. Thus, AIR MALTA acts as a middleman between the advertiser and you the customer. For example, an advertiser tells us that he/she wishes to reach an audience of males over 25 interested in winter sports clothing and if you have previously displayed interest in winter sports travel we will decide to forward such advertising to you and not to your neighbour who is probably much more interested in receiving information about travel books. 
With your permission we may share the information that you provide to us with selected third parties, primarily our advertisers and sponsors. You may opt-in of such sharing of information at the time of registration or later. If you opt-in to have such information shared at the time of registration, you will be able to opt-out any time thereafter. 
From time to time we may run contests on our site in which we ask participants for contact information, e.g., their email addresses. If you participate in contests, your contact information will be used primarily to reach you in connection with the contests. We may also use the collected contact information to send you information about AIR MALTA, our services and selected sponsors. You may opt to receive such mailings at the time of registration for the contest. If you do not opt to receive such information, we will not contact you. 


Your Right to Access and Control your Personal Information 

To make sure that you can control your personal information AIR MALTA enables you to: 

view the personal information we hold about you; 

request that any personal information that is inaccurate, irrelevant or out-of-date be amended or deleted; 

choose to stop using our services and have your personal information deleted, if such deletion is permissible by law and/or will not prejudice AIR MALTA's position at law;
