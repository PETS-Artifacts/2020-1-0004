As every website, we're using our own utilization stats to improve the service. We use Google Analytics to collect these datas, which once again aren't nominatives. But if you don't wish to communicate this type of information, The only nominatives infos that we transfer to a third party, punctually and if you allow it, are your Ulule coordinates to the project owner you did support, so he can receive his funds et send you (if there's one) your reward.
 
This is our commitment. We're a stickler for your privacy. Would you have a question, an inquiry, something on your mind, don't hesitate to mail us at : [email protected].
 
Then, if you'd rather use good old fashionned paper mail, you can write us here : Ulule, Privacy Service, 8 rue Saint-Fiacre, 75002 Paris. We'll answer you briefly.
