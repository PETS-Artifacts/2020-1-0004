When you create your Ulule account, we save only the datas you want to give us - and they rarely go further than your e-mail or website address. A word about Facebook, which gathers (often with good reasons) a lot of complaints about its privacy policy : we use Facebook Connect to ease the process for the users who'd rather login with their usual ID. We don't collect any data from your Facebook account other than your name and your profil picture. The other way, we don't transmit any data to Facebook, except the ones that you'd specifically authorized (notifications on your wall for example).
 
As every website, we're using our own utilization stats to improve the service. We use Google Analytics to collect these datas, which once again aren't nominatives. But if you don't wish to communicate this type of information, you can ask for an opt-out from Google Analytics.
 
The only nominatives infos that we transfer to a third party, punctually and if you allow it, are your Ulule coordinates to the project owner you did support, so he can receive his funds et send you (if there's one) your reward.
 
This is our commitment. We're a stickler for your privacy. Would you have a question, an inquiry, something on your mind, don't hesitate to mail us at : privacy@ulule.com.
 
Then, if you'd rather use good old fashionned paper mail, you can write us here : Ulule, Privacy Service, 8 rue Saint-Fiacre, 75002 Paris. We'll answer you briefly.
