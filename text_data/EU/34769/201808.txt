TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA OUT OF THE EEA

The Controller provides services all over the world. As a general rule, data should not be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area without the explicit consent of the User's individual. However, using our Web Sites and Services, you understand that Linemedia SIA may share certain information it collects with Linemedia FZC (its affiliate company in the UAE) or other branches of the Controller for the purposes described in this Policy, including, for identity verification, and payment processing.

Such a transfer does not require any specific authorization.
In cases where the Controller transfers personal data outside the European Economic Area, he relies separately, as an alternative, and independently on the following legal grounds for data transmission:


model articles. The European Commission has adopted standard treaty provisions (also known as model clauses) that provide guarantees for personal information transmitted outside Europe. The controller uses these model provisions when transferring personal information outside of Europe;
the contract performance. As we work in countries around the world and use the technical infrastructure outside of Europe to provide you with services, in accordance with the contract between us, we need to transfer the personal data of the Users to other jurisdictions as necessary to provide Users with services for the use of Websites and Services. Simply put, we can not provide you with services and fulfill our contract with you without moving your personal information around the world.

STORAGE OF PERSONAL DATA (RETENTION)

The Controller will retain your information only as long as it is necessary for the purposes set forth in this Policy, as long as your account is active, or as necessary for the provision of services.
