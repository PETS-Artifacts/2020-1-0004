How We Use Your Personal Information
We will use your personal information:
(i) to help us monitor and improve our UKTV Digital Services and for internal statistics and analytics purposes; 
(ii)    to help us design services, competitions or message board topics that we think will appeal to you and other users of our UKTV Digital Services;
(iii)   to allow you to participate in the interactive features of our UKTV Digital Services and to notify you about changes to our UKTV Digital Services;
(iv)     for system administration purposes. Please note that the information used for these purposes is limited to statistical data about your browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify anybody individually;
(v) to provide additional functionality to you, such as maintaining a list of your previously watched programmes, or suggesting programmes which might be of interest to you;
(vi)    to provide you with information about the digital products and services offered by UKTV including by post, email, SMS, telephone, social media, or online or via applications, where you have indicated that you wish to receive such marketing. In addition to or in combination with the details which you have provided (such as your gender, postcode or date of birth), we may use other information about your use of our UKTV Digital Services (such as programmes watched, preferred channels, time of viewing) to identify products and services which are more likely to be of interest to you;
(vii)   To help us personalise the services and communications you receive (including selling online advertising space to third parties). Personalisation may be based on various factors such as your age, postcode or gender, your device details or your inferred interests (which may come from the programmes you watch, preferred channels or time of viewing or other information which we learn about you from other sources). We (or third parties acting on our behalf) will use this information to place you into an "interest group" and to inform advertisers of the interest group into which you fall (but do not share any other personal information which directly identifies you), to enable our advertising partners to display more tailored advertising to you. However, by interacting with or viewing an advert, you should be aware that the third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert. Tailored advertising means that, in turn, that we are able to maximise the revenue that we generate from advertising to help us to cover the costs of the free services which we provide to you. Please see the Cookies Notice for further information on the cookies we use for targeted advertising (including how to opt out); 
(viii)  to meet our legal, regulatory and compliance requirements; and
(ix)    to communicate with you.

If you wish to stop receiving direct marketing communications at any time or you would like us to stop using your personal data for profiling and targeted advertising purposes, you can send us an email at viewers@uktv.co.uk. Please note that if you opt out of profiling and targeted advertising, this does not mean that you will receive less advertising when you use our UKTV Digital Services. This just means that the advertising you see may not be as relevant to you.
Where you have provided us with consent, you agree that we may contact you directly by the available method of communication nominated by you - post, email, telephone, SMS, or by any other specified method of communication.
