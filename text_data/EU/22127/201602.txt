Capterra is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors' personally identifiable information. To better protect your privacy, and so that you can understand our privacy practices, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is used by Capterra.
When you provide your personally identifiable information to Capterra, you expressly accept this Privacy Policy and provide full consent to the collection, storage and processing of your personally identifiable information by Capterra, and to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information to Capterra Affiliates and third parties in accordance with the terms set out in this Policy. "Capterra Affiliate" is any legal entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with Capterra.
Information We Collect and How We Use It
To enable visitors to take advantage of Capterra's services, we collect certain types of personally identifiable information from both software vendors and software buyers.
Software Vendors' Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect the following types of personally identifiable information from vendors to enable them to list their company and product information on our site: company name and a company contact's name, e-mail, and telephone number. In addition, we collect certain non-personally identifiable information about the vendor's company including location of headquarters and number of employees and customers.
The information that we collect from software vendors enables them to offer buyers opportunities to learn about products and services and to facilitate enterprise software transactions.
Software Users' and Purchasers' Personally Identifiable Information
We do not require visitors to register in order to do research using Capterra's website. However, if a visitor chooses to fill out a request for help finding software, we collect personally identifiable information including name, company name, email address, and phone number. We pass this information on to software vendors when the visitor has requested us to do so.
If a visitor fills out a review form, we collect personally identifiable information including name, company name, and email address. When a review is submitted, we pass name and company name to the software vendor. When a review is confirmed by the visitor, we display name and company name on our website. We share the visitor's email address with the software vendor upon request, on a case-by-case basis.
We also share your personally identifiable information with our Capterra Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Policy. In all cases, we collect, use and share your personally identifiable information in a lawful manner for relevant and appropriate business purposes. We retain your personally identifiable information only for as long as is necessary for the purpose(s) for which it was collected.
Non-Personally Identifiable Information
We may collect certain non-personally identifiable information about our visitors when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, and the domain name of your Internet service provider.
We use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage.

To enhance your experience with our site, we may use cookies. Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences.

Google Analytics advertising features also allow us to report on impressions of Google Display Network advertisements, such as when users view our banner advertisements and/or YouTube videos. We do not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information collected through any Google advertising products or features unless the user affirms their information by opting-in to receive communications from Capterra.
