What Information We Collect So that we can provide a personalised service, we may, upon registration or at other times on our Site, ask you to submit personal information to us. You may also be required to provide personal information to order products, enter competitions, vote in polls or otherwise express an opinion, subscribe to one of our services such as our online newsletters or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of information that may be collected at these pages include: your name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone/mobile number, your gender and date of birth. Different web pages on the Site may ask for different personal information. We may ask you for other information, including, but not limited to, your interests, opinions and the way you use our service to assist us in our initiatives outlined above and to improve our understanding of customer trends and patterns. You are under no obligation to provide such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services. If you're entering a competition, you can choose to tick either 'yes' or 'no' to let us know if you would like to be contacted or not. And don't worry, ticking 'no' won't affect your entry into the competition - your chances are as good as everyone else's! If you're registering specifically to hear from us, we'll take this as your consent, so we won't ask you to tick 'yes' or 'no'. Please note that sometimes on particular web pages on the Site we will require you to provide additional personal information. When we do this we will specify further on these web pages why we are collecting your information and how we will use it. 2.
