<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO PURCHASES MADE ONLINE VIA THE VUE WEBSITE OR TELEPHONE BOOKING LINE AND DO NOT APPLY TO PURCHASES MADE AT VUE CINEMAS.</strong></p>
<p>The online and telephone purchase of tickets for film showings at any Vue cinema is strictly subject to the following terms and conditions ("Ticket Terms"). By purchasing a Vue cinema ticket, you agree to be bound by these Ticket Terms. You also agree to use your ticket in accordance with these Ticket Terms and the Guest Admission Policy. Please read these Ticket Terms and the Guest Admission Policy carefully before purchasing your tickets.</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li><strong>Purchasing your tickets</strong>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>Cinema tickets may be purchased through the Vue websites listed in paragraph 8.1 below ("Site") or the Vue telephone booking line ("Booking Line") using a credit or debt card approved by us.</li>
        <li>By placing an order for tickets through the Site or the Booking Line, you are making a request to book tickets for the relevant performance subject to these Ticket Terms. Please note that this does not mean that your request has been accepted.</li>
        <li>We will only be bound by an on-line booking through the Site once we have processed your payment and we have sent an email to you confirming your booking.</li>
        <li>Ticket prices relate to the screening you wish to attend, not the day or time at which you purchase your ticket. Tickets are sold at the price displayed on the Site for the relevant film and showing time. All prices and fees include any applicable value added tax. Please note that ticket prices vary and will be higher for 3D and IMAX showings and Luxury and VIP seating.</li>
        <li>It is not possible to use any promotional vouchers or codes or Vue gift cards to book tickets through the Site unless expressly stated otherwise on the voucher or code (e.g. cinema specific "Cheap Day" codes) can be used on-line).</li>
        <li>Tickets are subject to availability and are generally non-refundable. We are under no obligation to refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in the event that you make any error when purchasing your tickets through the Site (including but not limited to selecting the wrong film or the wrong number of tickets), if you are excluded from viewing the film for any breach of these Ticket Terms or the Guest Admission Policy , or if your ticket is lost, stolen or damaged.  However, we may, entirely at our discretion, refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in any of the situations mentioned above or where there has been any customer service issue that we consider warrants a full or partial refund or other offer of goodwill from us. Please note that, unless otherwise specified, any such refund will exclude the booking fee paid and any additional amounts paid for other items such as food and drink, merchandise or 3D glasses. Refunds will be made to the same payment card used to make the booking and cannot be returned to gift cards. Redeemed voucher codes cannot be re-used if the tickets they were used to purchase are refunded or exchanged.</li>
        <li>Seating is unallocated unless otherwise specified at the point of purchase. Where seating is allocated at the time of booking, we will endeavour to ensure that you are provided with the seat that you have booked. However, we cannot guarantee the seating allocation and shall reserve the right to make changes at our discretion.</li>
        <li>For all tickets purchased through the Booking Line, a fee for booking your ticket(s) remotely is payable in addition to the ticket price. This will be clearly notified to you during the booking process. The total amount payable will be inclusive of the booking fee. By sending a request to book tickets, you agree to pay the booking fee in addition to the ticket price.</li>
        <li>For all tickets purchased on the website (other than at the specific cinemas listed below) a booking fee for booking your ticket(s) remotely is payable in addition to the ticket price. This will be clearly notified to you during the booking process. The total amount payable will be displayed as the headline ticket price inclusive of the booking fee. By sending a request to book tickets, you agree to pay the booking fee in addition to the ticket price.&nbsp;<br />

        <li>At all times, we will endeavour to ensure that advertised film schedules are materially accurate and that films are shown in accordance with such schedules. However, we cannot always guarantee the accuracy of the advertised schedules. We also reserve the right to cancel a showing, substitute an alternative film or vary the time of a showing, if necessary for any reason.</li>

    <ol class="list">
        <li><span style="font-weight: lighter;"></span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">Once you have booked your tickets online, you can collect them from the box office at your chosen cinema. Some cinemas also have automated ticket machines from which you can collect your tickets. If you have purchased a concession ticket, you may not be able to use the automated ticket machines because our staff may want to check your proof of identity before you are admitted. The cardholder must be present to collect the tickets, and you will need to take the same card as you have used to make your booking. If your tickets are for a 3D film, and you have ordered 3D glasses, you will receive a voucher for your 3D glasses when you collect your tickets. You can take your 3D glasses voucher to any designated collection point in the cinema to collect your 3D glasses before the film.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: lighter;"></span><span style="font-weight: lighter;">For tickets delivered to your mobile phone or computer as a QR barcode, please note that the person receiving the barcode is considered to be the rightful ticket holder and such barcode ticket can only be used once. You will be able to enter your screening without having to visit an ATM or counter if your confirmation email confirms that your barcode can be read by a member of staff at a gate. Please note that if you have pre-purchased food and beverage with your tickets you will still need to go to a counter to collect your order.<br />

<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLY TO PURCHASES MADE AT VUE CINEMAS AND DO NOT APPLY TO PURCHASES MADE ONLINE VIA THE VUE WEBSITE OR TELEPHONE BOOKING LINE.</strong><br />
The offline (i.e. in-cinema) purchase of tickets for film showings at any Vue cinema is strictly subject to the following terms and conditions ("Ticket Terms"). By purchasing a Vue cinema ticket, you agree to be bound by these Ticket Terms. You also agree to use your ticket in accordance with these Ticket Terms and the Guest Admission Policy. Please read these Ticket Terms and the Guest Admission Policy carefully before purchasing your tickets.</p>
<ol class="list">
    <li><strong>Purchasing your tickets</strong>
    <ol class="list">
        <li>You can purchase tickets from the box office at your chosen cinema. Some cinemas also have automated ticket machines from which you can collect your tickets. If you wish to purchase a concession ticket, you may not be able to use the automated ticket machines, because our staff may want to check your proof of identity before you are admitted.</li>
        <li>We accept the following forms of payment for the purchase of your tickets:<br />
        <ol class="list">
            <li>cash in the form of pounds sterling only (except in Dublin where we accept Euros only); or</li>
            <li>selected debit/credit cards approved by us; or</li>
            <li>Vue gift cards &amp; vouchers (see paragraph 2 below).</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ticket prices relate to the screening you wish to attend, not the day or time at which you purchase your ticket. Ticket prices will be displayed at the point of purchase. All prices and fees include any applicable value added tax. Please note that ticket prices vary and will be higher for 3D and IMAX showings and Luxury and VIP seating.</li>
        <li>Tickets are subject to availability and are generally non-refundable. We are under no obligation to refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in the event that you make any error when purchasing your tickets (including but not limited to selecting the wrong film or the wrong number of tickets), if you are excluded from viewing the film for any breach of these Ticket Terms or the Guest Admission Policy, or if your ticket is lost, stolen or damaged. However, we may, entirely at our discretion, refund you or exchange your ticket(s) in any of the situations mentioned above or where there has been any customer service issue that we consider warrants a full or partial refund or other offer of goodwill from us. Please note that, unless otherwise specified, any such refund will exclude any additional amounts paid for other items such as food and drink, merchandise or 3D glasses. Refunds will be made to the same payment card used to make the booking (or in cash if you paid for the tickets in cash) and cannot be returned to gift cards. Redeemed voucher codes cannot be re-used if the tickets they were used to purchase are refunded or exchanged.</li>
        <li>Seating is unallocated unless otherwise specified at the point of purchase. Where seating is allocated at the time of purchase, we will endeavour to ensure that you are provided with the seat that you have purchased. However, we cannot guarantee the seating allocation and shall reserve the right to make changes at our discretion.</li>
        <li>For 3D films, you may purchase 3D glasses at your chosen cinema. You will receive a voucher for your 3D glasses, which you can take to any designated collection point in the cinema to collect your 3D glasses before the film.</li>
        <li>Please note that not all advertised ticket offers will be available for tickets purchased in person at the cinema, and in some cases you may need to purchase tickets in advance online to benefit from such offers.</li>
        <li>Additional 75p booking fee applies for tickets purchased online or via our call centre.<br />
