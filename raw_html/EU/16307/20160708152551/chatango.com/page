We use cookies and Flash Shared Objects to improve the quality of our service. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.

We do store IP addresses of all incoming connections to Chatango servers. This information is stored for security purposes such as preventing abuse or intrusion. When a user sends a message to a Chatango Group, the IP address of the sender is recorded and displayed to the group owner and to the group moderators created by the group owner, so that the group owner and moderators can ban the sender from the group. IP addresses contain no personal or confidential information.

When available, we store the device identification information (model, operating system version, serial number, IMEI) and a phone number of the device where Chatango apps are installed.

The appropriate permissions to access this information are requested by Google Play Store and Apple App Store when the Chatango app is installed.
<br><br><b>Payment Information</b><br>
We store payment information (credit card type, card holder's name, credit card expiration date, PayPal account email) for all payments and donations made to Chatango. Credit card numbers are not stored on our servers. This information is only used for security purposes, such as preventing fraudulent payments.
