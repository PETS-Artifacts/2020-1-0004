</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<h4 id="sharedirectly">Information About You That You Share With Us Directly</h4>

</li></ul><p>If you give us your mobile telephone number (including for SMS text messaging services), we will also collect and store that number.</p>
<h4 id="infocontacts">Information About Your Contacts</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll collect information that you provide to us about your contacts, but be sure to ask their permission first.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>We may give you the ability to import your address book contacts or to manually enter them so that you can locate your contacts using Zynga Services and invite them to join you in our games or other aspects of our Services. You are responsible for getting your contacts’ permission before you give their contact details to us. We may also get information about you from other Zynga users importing or entering their contacts. We use and may store this contact information to help you and your contacts connect through our Services. If you want to remove your contacts stored by us, follow any instructions provided in the Service to request that we remove them from our systems or <a href="#13">Contact Us</a>. If you need to enter a password to allow us to access your address book, we will not store that password.</p>
<h4>Information You Generate Using Our Services</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll collect information about the ways you use and interact with our Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>When you use our Services, we’ll collect information about the ways in which you use and interact with our Services, such as when and for how long you play our games, game features and other players you interact with, purchases you make, progress or levels you achieve, and other gameplay activities.</p>
<p>If you choose to use communication features in Zynga Services that allow you to communicate or share information with other players, then we’ll collect information on what is communicated or shared. This includes:</p>
<ul><li>your participation in player forums and message boards;
</li><li>your public posts or comments on other players’ profiles or gameboards;
</li><li>your non-public messages or invitations to other players, made either directly on our websites or through in-game mechanisms;

</li><li>your posted photos, drawings, or other user-generated content.
</li></ul><p>We may access in real-time, record, and/or store archives of these communications, comments, photos, drawings, and other user-generated content on Zynga’s servers to make use of them to protect the safety and well-being of our players; to protect Zynga’s rights and property in connection with our Services; to conduct research; to operate, improve, personalize, and optimize our Services and our players’ experiences, including through the use of analytics; and to manage and deliver advertising. Where required by law, we will seek your consent for this. </p>
<h4>Payment Information</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll collect information related to any purchases you make.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>If you purchase in-game virtual currency or items in a game you play on Zyngagames.com, our third-party payment processor will collect the billing and financial information it needs to process your charges. This may include your postal address, e-mail address, and financial information. Zynga’s payment processors do not share your financial information, like credit card numbers, with Zynga, but they may share non-financial information with us related to your purchases, like your name, billing address, and the items purchased. </p>
<p>When you play Zynga’s games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or platforms (like Facebook, Apple, Google, or Amazon), any purchases you make will be processed by that third-party application and subject to that third-party application’s terms of service and privacy policy. For these purchases, Zynga does not receive your financial information, but may receive non-financial information related to your purchases, like your name, approximate physical location, and the items purchased. The information Zynga receives depends on the Zynga game you’re playing and the third-party application. Zynga’s <a href="https://www.zynga.com/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a> explain our policies and terms related to charges, billing, third-party credits, and virtual currencies. Please note that purchases of third-party credits or currencies are also subject to those parties’ terms of service and privacy policies.</p>
<h4>Customer Support Correspondence</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll keep a record of any correspondence between us.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>When you ask for help from our Customer Support team, we will collect and store the contact information you give them (generally, your name and e-mail address), information about your game play or activity on our Services, and your Zynga player and/or social network ID number. We will also store the communications you have with our Customer Service team and any additional information in those communications in order to provide support and improve the Services.</p>
<h4>Information About You That We Get From Connected Third-Party Applications, Including Social Networks</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll collect some information from other companies, including social networks, if you access our games through your accounts with those companies or you choose to connect your accounts with those companies to our games.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>If you play Zynga’s games or access any of our other Services on connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any third-party applications, including social networks like Facebook, Zynga may receive certain information about you from the provider of the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Zynga game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy settings, and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that third-party application.</p>
<p>For example, Zynga may collect and store some or all of the following information from the provider of the connected third-party application:</p>
<ul><li>your first and last name;
</li><li>your profile picture or its URL;
</li><li>your user identification number (like your Facebook ID number), which may be linked to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo;
</li><li>your friends’ user ID numbers and other public data;
</li><li>the e-mail address you provided to that third-party application;
</li><li>your approximate physical location and that of the devices you use to access our Services;
</li><li>your gender;
</li><li>your birthday, age, and/or age range;
</li><li>information about your activities on or through the connected third-party application;
</li><li>other publicly-available information on the third-party application; and/or
</li><li>any other information that you or the provider of the third-party application share with Zynga.
</li></ul><p>If you access our Services from a third-party application or connect our Services to a third-party application, you should also read that third-party application’s terms of service and privacy policy.</p>
<p>If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more about their privacy practices.</p>
<h4>Cookies and Other Automated Information Collection</h4>

<div class="chapter-content">

<h3 id="3">3. How We Use Information We Collect and Our Legal Bases for Processing It</h3>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We use your information to provide, personalize, maintain the security of, and improve the Services you use; to maintain our business operations; and to exercise, defend or establish our rights.</p>
<p>We use your information under several legal bases, including to perform our contract with you, for our legitimate business interests, to comply with our legal obligations, or otherwise with your consent.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide you with the Services you request from us and to improve your gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we collect and store your information include:</p>
<ul><li>to improve and optimize our Services and our players’ experiences;
</li><li>to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;
</li><li>to identify and suggest connections with other Zynga players and personalize our Services to you;
</li><li>to communicate with you about the Services you’re using, including in-game updates, new Services, and promotional offers that we think might be of interest to you;
</li><li>to enable players to communicate with each other;
</li><li>to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;
</li><li>to protect the safety and well-being of our players;
</li><li>to protect Zynga’s rights and property in connection with our Services;
</li><li>to prevent fraud or potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our <a href="https://www.zynga.com/legal/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>;
</li><li>to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;
</li><li>to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business partners;
</li><li>to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third parties; and/or
</li><li>to conduct research.
</li></ul><p>If you are located in the European Countries (defined above in <a href="#1">Section 1</a>), our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above depends on what the information is and the context in which we collect it. </p>
<p>However, we’ll normally collect information from you only where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms of Service), where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights), or if we otherwise have your consent.</p>
<p>In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation or need to collect information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person (for example, another player).</p>
<p>If we ask you to provide information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you, this will normally be clear from the context in which we are asking you to provide your information (for example, when we ask you to provide a username to access our Services, this will be to create an account for you in accordance with our Terms of Service), and, if not, we will provide an explanation to you at the relevant time. We will also make clear whether providing information is mandatory. </p>
<p>Similarly, if we collect and use your information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), it will be made clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are (such as personalizing our services and marketing, for example).</p>
<p>If you have questions or need further information about the legal bases on which we collect and use your personal information, please <a href="#13">Contact Us</a>.</p>

<h3 id="4">4. How We Share Information</h3>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll share your information with third parties when you use our Services under the circumstances described in this section.</p>
<p>We’ll share some of your information with your friends and other Zynga players that you’re playing with to facilitate your gaming interactions with them.</p>

<p>We may share your information, including personal information, with third parties or allow third parties to collect this information from our Services in the following circumstances:</p>
<h4>Friends and Other Zynga Players</h4>
<p>Zynga’s games and Services support and often encourage you to interact with other players. In most Zynga games, if you play through a social network or connect to a social network (for example, Facebook), your social network friends who also play a Zynga game will see your name, photo, player profile (which may include the information described above in <a href="#sharedirectly">Information About You That You Share With Us Directly</a>), and descriptions of your in-game activity (including any Zynga games you have played).</p>
<p>In addition, in many Zynga games, other players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends, will be able to see your player profile (as described above); view descriptions of your in-game activity; communicate with you within our Services; and send you game requests or friend requests through our Services or the related social network. For example, in Zynga Poker, when you are playing at a table, all the other players at the same table can see your player profile and send you an in-game chat message.</p>
<h4>Third-Party Advertising Including Behavioral Advertising and Analytics</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>We’ll share some of your information with advertisers to tailor the advertisements you see when you use our Services to your interests and to enable us to offer some of our Services for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>We use advertising to enable us to offer some of our games, game features, and other Services for free. These advertisements may include, without limitation, banner ads on game boards or Services themselves, as full-screen ads between moves or games, or through an “offer wall” in which third-party advertisers offer to provide virtual currency or other in-game items to players in exchange for watching an advertisement or for completing a task, such as signing up for an account with one of the advertisers, completing a survey, or finishing a particular game level. Offer walls are hosted by third-party offer wall providers, and the offers are made by third-party advertisers, not by Zynga.</p>
<p>We do not actively share personal information that directly identifies you with third-party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.</p>
<p>To enable advertisers, ad networks, and offer wall providers to serve you with more relevant ads, they may collect, or we may collect and share with them, the following types of information when you use our Services:</p>
<ul><li>performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
</li><li>certain technical information (like IP address, non-persistent device identifier such as IDFA, and de-identified persistent device identifier such as a hashed Android ID);
</li><li>a unique identifier, such as your social network ID or Zynga player ID; and/or
</li><li>other contextual data about your game play (like your level and session length).
</li></ul><p>In addition to serving you with relevant ads, the information collected may be used to:</p>
<ul><li>measure how effective ads are;
</li><li>offer you targeted advertising (both on and off our Services) in order to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as interest-based advertising or behavioral advertising); and/or
</li><li>undertake web analytics to analyze traffic and other player activity to improve your experience.
</li></ul><p>Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies, and they may use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the same time.</p>
<p>Please note, after clicking on a third-party advertisement or offer, you may no longer be on a site or app controlled by Zynga or the social network through which you are playing Zynga’s games.</p>
<p>If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties, please see <a href="#howtoaccess">How to Access, Update, and Manage Your Personal Information</a>. For more information on controlling the use of cookies and similar technologies, please see our <a href="https://www.zynga.com/privacy/about-cookies">Cookie Notice</a>.  Please note that the practices of third-party companies delivering advertisements on our Services are subject to those companies’ own privacy policies.</p>

<h4>Managing Personal Information We Receive From Third-Party Applications / Platforms And From Your Mobile Device</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>To manage the information we receive from third-party applications or platforms and from your mobile device, use the tools and settings provided by the third-party application and your mobile device.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>To manage the information Zynga receives about you from a third-party application or platform where you play our games, like Facebook, Apple, Google, or Amazon, you will need to follow the third-party application’s instructions for updating your information and changing your privacy settings. The privacy management tools for applications on Facebook can be found <a href="https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=applications">here</a>.</p>
<p>You also can manage many aspects of information collection and use from your mobile device by visiting the “settings” page of your mobile device or web browser and reviewing the access permissions of each Zynga game / application.</p>
<p>To the extent that one of our games is collecting information about non-Zynga applications you have on your mobile device, the game will provide you with an option to stop making that information available to us in the game’s “settings” page.</p>
<p>Once Zynga receives your information from a third-party application / platform or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by Zynga in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and update that information as described above.</p>
<h4>Opting Out of Promotional Communications from Zynga</h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>You can unsubscribe from promotional emails by clicking the “unsubscribe” link or visiting our Email Settings page. You can opt out of mobile push notifications in your device’s settings page. You can opt out of SMS text communications by texting STOP.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from Zynga, click on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any promotional email from Zynga or visit our <a href="https://emailsettings.zynga.com/accounts/">Email Settings page</a>. Your unsubscribe request or e-mail preferences change will be processed promptly, and in no event longer than ten business days. During that processing period, you may receive additional promotional emails from us.</p>
<p>If you want to stop receiving push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile device even when the app is not on, you can turn off push notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page. Many of our games also offer the ability to turn off push notifications in the in-game “settings” page.</p>
<p>You can opt out of receiving SMS text messages by texting back STOP to the number we send the text from for that particular SMS text messaging program or by <a href="#13">Contacting Us</a>. When we receive an opt-out message from you for SMS text messages, we may send a text message confirming receipt.</p>
<p>Please note that if you opt out of receiving promotional communications from us, we may still communicate with you from time to time if we need to provide you with information about the Services you are using from us, if we need to request information from you with respect to a transaction initiated by you, or for other legitimate non-marketing reasons, for example, if we update this Privacy Policy or our Terms of Service.</p>
<h4>Opting Out of Third-Party Behavioral Advertising </h4>
</div>
<div class="summary">
<p>You can opt out of third-party behavioral advertising through your device settings and other third-party opt-out tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="chapter-content">
<p>If you are interested in more information about behavioral advertising and your choices to prevent behavioral web and mobile web advertising from third parties, you may visit the following websites:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/">Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page</a> or the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2#!/">Digital Advertising Alliance Opt-Out Page</a> for U.S.-based advertising; and
</li><li><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices">Your Online Choices</a> website for EU-based advertising.
</li></ul><p>If you do not want to receive behavioral in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests on your mobile device, you may adjust the ad tracking settings on your device (such as turning on “Limit Ad Tracking”). You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (such as an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to your previous “Advertising Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for behavioral advertising.</p>
<p>All of the opt-out tools described in this subsection are provided by third parties, not by Zynga. Zynga does not control or operate these tools or the choices that advertisers and others provide through these tools. </p>
<p>Please note that you may still receive third-party advertisements in Zynga’s Services after using these opt-out tools, but the advertising you see may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<div class="chapter-content">
<p>IMPORTANT: When you use our Services, your personal information may be sent to the United States and possibly other countries.</p>

This staff may be engaged in, among other things, (i) the processing of transactions and your payment details, or (ii) the provision of support services. When we transfer your personal information internationally we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely, lawfully, and in the manner we describe here.

If you access our Services through a social network and your social network account is hacked or otherwise compromised, this may lead to someone accessing or deleting your Zynga game accounts without your permission. So, be careful to keep your social network account information, including your social network account password, secure as well. We urge you to log out of your Zynga account and any social network account you have used to access our Services when you are finished using them.</p>
<p>When you sign into your Zynga account or enter payment information, we and our third-party payment processor use encryption to transmit that information.</p>
<p>While we take precautions against possible security breaches of our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure.
