        <p>In more detail, we use the information we collect to:</p>
        <dl>

            <dd>We use the information we receive to provide our services to you, and to maintain and operate the Website. For example, it wouldn’t be possible to allow members to exchange postcards if we didn’t have their postal address. Other types of provided information allow us to authenticate you into your account, create your profile, show you maps and statistics about your activities and personalize certain aspects of the Website such as the types of advertisement you see or your preferred units of measurement.</dd>

    <section id="how-we-share-the-collected-information">
        <h2>How we share the collected information</h2>

        <h3>Between members</h3>
        <p>The goal of Postcrossing is to connect the world via real mail, by allowing you to exchange postcards with other random members around the world. Thus, it is central to our service to share your postal address so that you can receive postcards from other members. However, we take great care to do this sharing in a controlled way. For example,</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is not possible for someone to request access to a specific address; instead, the Website randomly selects the destination of each postcard.</li>
            <li>We also limit the amount of addresses an account can request and have in place several security measures to prevent abuse.</li>
            <li>The number of times your address may be shared is proportional to the amount of postcards you have sent yourself. By consequence, until you send your first postcard and become eligible to receive one back, your address is not shared with anyone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>With others</h3>
        <p>We rely on some third party companies and individuals to provide certain services on our behalf, either because they are necessary to bring you our service or because they help us improve it. These third parties may have access to some personal information, but Postcrossing ensures that entities that have access to personal information are credible and offer high guarantees of protection, never transmitting more information than that which is necessary to provide the contracted service.</p>

        <p>Some of the service providers we use include:</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Analytics</dt>
            <dd>To understand how our Website is used and to improve it, we use a third party statistical information gathering service called Google Analytics provided by Google. This service collects <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2763052?hl=en">anonymized</a> information about the Website usage (for example, time of visits, pages viewed and type of operating system used) through the use of cookies. The data collected by Google Analytics about your use of our Website is kept for a period of 26 months. You can find Google’s Privacy Policy on <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">its website</a>.</dd>

            <dt>Advertising</dt>
            <dd>To be able to support the service we provide to you, we display advertisement banners on our Website using third party advertising networks and platforms such as Google DFP and Google AdSense — you can learn how Google manages data in its ads products on <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/partner-sites/">this page</a>. Where required, if the type of ads we show you collect, share and/or use your information for ad personalization, we will request your consent prior to showing them to you, and you can withdraw your consent at any time.</dd>
        </dl>

        <h3>Legal obligations</h3>
        <p>Postcrossing may also share information with third parties regarding investigations, judicial enquiries and legal or administrative procedures, when required to do so by law.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="how-we-store-and-secure-information">
        <h2>How we store and secure information</h2>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We take the security of personal information very seriously, and do our best to safeguard it. Keeping in mind the industry best practices and the technical knowledge available, we use technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, both during transmission and after it is received, against destruction, accidental or unlawful loss, accidental alteration, disclosure or unauthorized access, within a level of security appropriate to the nature of the information being protected. However, Postcrossing cannot guarantee the total security of the information of its users' accounts against all possible situations of unauthorized access, hardware or software failures and other factors that may compromise the security of the information.</p>

        <h3>Accounts</h3>
        <p>Your account access is protected by a password chosen by you. You should make careful use of the Website in order to prevent unauthorized access of your account and your personal information, namely, by carefully choosing and protecting your password and limiting access to the devices through which you access the Website.</p>

        <h3>Hosting</h3>
        <p>To provide you access to our Website, we use the hosting provider <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon AWS</a>, and their data centers in the E.U. Amazon AWS follows the industry best practices, adheres to globally known <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/">compliance programs</a> in both security and data privacy, and implements several recognized certifications assessed by independent auditors.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we use several technical measures to secure the information stored and ensure strict controlled access to it. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls, intrusion detection systems, data encryption and access controls.</p>

        <h3>Backups</h3>
        <p>In order to ensure continued availability of the Website in case of any technical or physical incidents, we make regular backups of the information so we can restore your access to it in a timely manner. These backups are encrypted and kept for a limited period of time.</p>

        <h3>Storage period</h3>
        <p>When your account is terminated (either by you or by us), if you don't have any postcards traveling from your account, all your personal information is immediately deleted.</p>
        <p>If you still have postcards traveling to other members, we may keep some of your account information (name, username, email, address, profile text and IP address) until either these postcards arrive or are deleted by our system. We do this so that we can help the recipients of your postcards register them, if they need our help. This means, some information can be kept for up to one year, but you can always <a href="/contact">contact us</a> at any time to request that it is deleted sooner.</p>
        <p>We may also keep some information to comply with legal obligations (for example, applicable tax/revenue laws), to resolve disputes or to enforce our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="how-you-can-access-and-control-your-information">
        <h2>How you can access and control your information</h2>

        <p>Most of the information Postcrossing collects about you is easily accessible to you simply by logging in to the Website.</p>
        <p>Through your account settings, you can update your information, withdraw any consent that you had previously given (for instance, about which emails you’d like to receive from us or which types of ads you’re shown) or <a href="/terminate">terminate your account</a> to erase your personal information. Please ensure you’ve read the details about how long we store your information on the “storage period” section above.</p>
        <p>If you require additional access to other information about your account, or would like to exercise your right to data portability, you’ll need to <a href="/contact">contact us</a> so that we can first verify your identity.</p>
        <p>Under certain circumstances, you may have the right to restrict the processing of your information. Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>, so that we can analyze your request.</p>

    <section id="how-we-transfer-information-we-collect-internationally">
        <h2>How we transfer information we collect internationally</h2>

        <p>When we transfer any personal information to a third party service provider in a country which is not a member state of the E.U., we will comply with the applicable legislation, in particular, we will make sure there is an adequate level of protection offered to personal information and we will not transfer personal information to services in jurisdictions that do not provide adequate safety and security guarantees.</p>
