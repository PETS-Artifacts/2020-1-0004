<h1 style="text-align: center;">British Gas privacy policy</h1>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">How we store, protect and use the information you give us</h3>

<h4>This privacy policy is about how we use personal information about individuals, sole traders or partnerships. It doesn’t apply to the information we hold about companies or other organisations.</h4>

<p><strong>About this policy</strong></p>

<p>Britishgas.co.uk is brought to you by British Gas, which is owned by Centrica plc. Centrica (and all its subsidiary companies) believe it’s important to protect your privacy. So we’re committed to giving you a personal service that meets your needs, at the same time as protecting that privacy.</p>

<p>This policy explains how we’ll collect information about you and then use it to give you a good service. It also goes into the security measures we take to protect your privacy, and expands on a few things that we won’t do.</p>

<p><strong>How we’ll get in touch</strong></p>

<p>When we first ask you for your personal information – or when you get a new service or product from us – we’ll give you the opportunity to tell us if you don’t want to receive information from us about our other products and services. It’ll normally be a box to tick on an application form or contract, and you can change your mind at any time.</p>

<h4>1. How we’ll use your information</h4>

<p>1.1 We may use your information to:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Give you the services you’ve asked for (which might include the loyalty and incentive schemes we run from time to time).</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Offer you accounts, services and products from us or our partners. To do this, we may use an automated scoring system, which also uses information from credit reference agencies and other companies.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Help run and improve our accounts, services and products – ones we’ve provided before, now or in the future.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Create statistics, test our computer systems, create profiles and marketing opportunities, and analyse customer information. To do these things, we might use information about what you buy from us and how you pay for it. Like how much gas you use and what discounts we’ve offered you, for example.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Help prevent and detect debt, fraud and loss.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Train our staff.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Get in touch with you about products and services that we or our partners are offering. That could be by email, phone, text, multimedia message or another form of electronic communication – like a message through your smart meter.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>1.2 We may also monitor and record any communications we have with you, like phone conversations and emails. This is just to make sure we’re providing you with a good service and meeting our regulatory and legal responsibilities.</p>

<p>We’ll use the contact information you’ve given us when we need to get in touch. So we might email you, give you a ring, send a text or use another form of electronic communication (like a message through your smart meters). We might even visit you in person.</p>

<p>If we’re getting in touch to tell you about offers, we’ll try and use your preferred contact method. We can stop sending you these offers at any time though, you just have to contact us and give us your account details.</p>

<h4>3. Passing your information on</h4>

<p>3.1 We may allow other people and organisations to use your information (including other Centrica Group companies that use the British Gas, Scottish Gas and Dyno Group brands). Why?</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="blue-circle">To give you the services you’ve asked for, which might include giving information to members of your family, household, anyone acting on your behalf or other people who have an interest (like landlords or letting agents).</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">As part of our sales process for one or more of the businesses.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">To help find and prevent debt, fraud or loss (by passing your information on to a credit reference agency, for example).</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">To transfer any unpaid debt to another organisation – we’ll have to give them details about you and that debt.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">For legal or regulatory purposes (like if Ofgem or a lawyers are asking after you).</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">For future legal action.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">As part of government data-sharing initiatives, like those designed to help people who are struggling to pay for heating and electricity.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">As part of any loyalty or reward schemes.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">To help with your insurance policy. If you take out insurance with British Gas, we’ll pass your information on to an insurer to manage the policy. They’ll take care of your underwriting and claims, develop new services and asses your financial and insurance risk.</span></li>
</ul>



</div>


   
   
   
   <div class="parbase text">
<p>3.2 Occasionally, the other people or organisations we pass your information to might be outside of the European Economic Area (EEA). Because of that, we may pass your information to countries that have different standards and laws about protecting personal information.</p>

<p>3.3 If we suspect someone has committed fraud or stolen energy by tampering with the meter or diverting the energy supply, we’ll note it in our account records and may share the information with Ofgem, or anyone else who needs to know – like other energy suppliers, landlords and housing associations.</p>

<p>We may use this information to make decisions about you, your character, and how likely we think you are to pay for your energy. So we may record sensitive personal information like any criminal offences you’ve been accused of.</p>

<p>If the gas or electricity supply to your property has been tampered with or stolen in the past (or we suspect it has), we may take this into account when we decide what products or services we can offer you – and the terms and conditions we can give you.</p>

<p>3.4 We may ask your old energy supplier for the information we need to take over your supply. That includes information about meter readings, equipment and payments. We can pass on that kind of information to your new supplier when you move on, too.</p>

<p>3.5 If we think that you (or anyone in your household) might need extra care (because of age, health, disability or financial circumstances, for example), we may record this in our records. We’ll use this information if things go wrong in the future, and might share it with:</p>

<p><strong>Support organisations</strong></p>

<p>Like social services, charities, or healthcare organisations. We’ll pass on your information to them if we think you (or someone else in your home) needs help.</p>

<p><strong>Other energy suppliers</strong></p>

<p>If you’re thinking about changing suppliers, we’ll pass your information on to your new suppliers. We’ll assess which customers need extra care and record and share this information in line with the Energy Retail’s Association procedures – which means we may share it with your gas transporter, metering agent or network operator, too.</p>

<p>3.6 We may pass your information on to organisations that supervise the industry, like GasSafe and the Electrical Contractors Association (ECA). This includes your address, postcode, and information about your gas appliances, flue, hot water cylinder, system controls, electrical installations, repair and removals.</p>

<p>These organisations may then pass this information on to local authorities to meet building regulations. Or they might contact you to inspect your appliances or systems, recall faulty products, carry out audits or for health and safety reasons. Wherever it’s appropriate, we’ll give you or the property owner (or both) a certificate to show that your appliances and systems meet building regulations.</p>



</div>


   
   
   
   <div class="parbase text">

<p>3.7 We’ll check your details with credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to help us make decisions about whether or not you’re eligible to make payments on our goods and services. There’s a brief guide below on how we’ll use your information with these agencies – but you can find the full version in our terms and conditions. Or phone us on <a href="tel:08000480202">0800 048 0202</a> and we’ll send you a leaflet all about it.</p>

<p>a. We’ll search credit reference and fraud prevention agencies for information about you or the people you’re applying for an account with. (So if you’re filling out a joint application with someone else, make sure they know and agree that we’ll use their information to do this.) If you use information that’s false or wrong, we might suspect fraud. In that case, we’ll pass your details on to credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies (like the police and HM Revenue &amp; Customers) can see and use this information too.</p>

<p>b. We (and other organisations) may also access and use information about you that credit reference and fraud prevention agencies give us to, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Check details on applications you make for credit and credit-related services.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Check your identity.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Prevent and detect fraud and money laundering.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Manage credit and credit-related accounts or services.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Recover debt.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Check details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance.</span></li>
<li><span class="blue-circle">Check details of employees and people applying for jobs with us.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>c. When credit reference agencies receive a search from us, they’ll record this on your credit file (whether your application is successful or not).</p>

<p>d. We’ll send information on your account to credit reference agencies and they’ll record it. We’ll give them details of your account and how you manage it. Credit reference agencies will also make a record if you don’t repay money you owe us in full or on time. They may give this information to other organisations and fraud prevention agencies to carry out similar checks, find out where you are and deal with any money you owe. The credit reference agencies keep records for six years after your account has been closed, you have paid the final debt or action has been taken against you to recover the debt.</p>

<p>e. We may access and use the information fraud prevention agencies have collected on you from our overseas offices.  </p>

<p>f. If you want to know what information credit reference and fraud prevention agencies hold about you, contact these agencies.</p>

<p>It’s worth contacting them all, because the information they have might not be the same. They’ll charge you a small fee.</p>
