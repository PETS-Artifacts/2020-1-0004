<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CLIENT DATA:</strong> The data we collect about Clients is actually very limited. We generally only need to have your contact details or the details of individual contacts at your organisation (such as their names, telephone numbers and email addresses) to enable us to ensure that our relationship runs smoothly. We also hold information relating to your engagement with Candidate profiles and other material published by GRS Global Recruitment Solutions, which we use to ensure that our marketing communications to you are relevant and timely. We may also hold extra information that someone in your organisation has chosen to tell us. In certain circumstances, such as when you engage with our Finance and Credit Control personnel, and calls with you may be documented. If we need any additional personal data for any reason, we will let you know.</p>

Emergency contact details give us somebody to call on in an emergency. To ask for a reference, we'll obviously need the referee's contact details (such as name, email address and telephone number). We'll also need these details if our Candidate or a member of our Staff has put you down as their emergency contact so that we can contact you in the event of an accident or an emergency.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WEBSITE USERS:</strong> We collect a limited amount of data from our Website Users which we use to help us to improve your experience when using our website and to help us manage the services we provide.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong><br /><strong>CANDIDATE DATA:</strong> We collect Candidate personal data in three primary ways:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Personal data that you, the Candidate, gives to us;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Personal data that we receive from other sources; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Personal data that we collect automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data you give to us</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRS Global Recruitment Solutions needs to know certain information about you in order to provide a tailored service. This will enable us to provide you with the best opportunities, and should save you time in not having to trawl through information about jobs and services that are not relevant to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are numerous ways you can share your information with us. It all depends on what suits you. These may include</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Entering your details on the GRS Global Recruitment Solutions website as part of the registration process;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Leaving a hard copy CV at a GRS Global Recruitment Solutions recruitment event, job fair or office;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data we receive from other sources</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- Your referees may disclose personal information about you;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Our Clients may share personal information about you with us;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- We may obtain information about you from searching for potential Candidates from third party sources, such as LinkedIn and other job sites;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data we collect automatically</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the extent that you access our website or read or click on an email from us, we may also collect your data automatically or through you providing it to us.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CLIENT DATA:</strong> We collect Client personal data in three ways:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Personal data that we receive directly from you;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2. Personal data that we receive from other sources; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3. Personal data that we collect automatically.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data that we receive directly from you</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We both share the same goal – to make sure that you have the best staff for your organisation. We will receive data directly from you in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Where you contact us proactively, usually by phone or email; and/or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Where we contact you, either by phone or email, or through our Consultants' business development activities more generally.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data we receive from other sources</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- From third party market research and by analyzing online and offline media (which we may do ourselves, or employ other organizations to do for us);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- From delegate lists at relevant events; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- From other limited sources and third parties (for example from our Candidates to the extent that they provide us with your details to act as a referee for them).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Personal data we collect via our website</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the extent that you access our website or read or click on an email from us, where appropriate we may also collect your data automatically or through you providing it to us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Having obtained data about you, we then use it in a number of ways.</p>

In particular, we may wish to use your data for the purposes listed below, where appropriate and in accordance with laws and requirements. Please note that this list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">-enable us to develop and market other products and services;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- market our full range of recruitment services (permanent, temporary, contract, outplacement, MSP programs and RPO services) to you;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- send you details of reports, promotions, offers, networking and client events, and general information about the industry sectors which we think might be of interest to you; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- display promotional excerpts from your details on GRS Global Recruitment Solutions' website(s) as a success story (only where we have obtained your express consent to do so).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We may need your consent for some aspects of these activities which are not covered by our legitimate interests and, depending on the situation, we'll ask for this via an opt-in or soft-opt-in (which we explain further below).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Soft opt-in consent is a specific type of consent which applies where you have previously engaged with us (for example by submitting a job application or CV, or registering a vacancy to be filled), and we are marketing other recruitment-related services. Under ‘soft opt-in’ consent, we will take your consent as given unless or until you opt out. For most people, this is beneficial as it allows us to suggest other jobs to you alongside the specific one you applied for, significantly increasing the likelihood of us finding you a new position. For other types of e-marketing, we are required to obtain your explicit consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you want to know more about how we obtain consent, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a>. If you are not happy about our approach to marketing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and can find out more about how to do so please contact us at dpo@grsrecruitment.com. Nobody's perfect, even though we try to be. We want to let you know that even if you have opted out from our marketing communications, it is possible that your details may be recaptured through public sources in an unconnected marketing campaign. We will try to make sure this doesn't happen, but if it does, we're sorry. We'd just ask that in those circumstances you opt out again.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All our marketing is based on what we think will serve our Clients and Candidates best, but we know we won’t always get it right for everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Equal opportunities monitoring and other sensitive personal data</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We are committed to ensuring that our recruitment processes are aligned with our approach to equal opportunities. Some of the data we may in appropriate circumstances collect about you comes under the umbrella of "diversity information". This could be information about your ethnic background, gender, disability, age, sexual orientation, religion or other similar beliefs, and/or social-economic background. Where appropriate and in accordance with the laws of Cyprus &amp; Malta, we'll use this information on an anonymized basis to monitor our compliance with equal opportunities. We may also disclose this (suitably anonymized where relevant) data to Clients where this is contractually required or the Client specifically requests such information to enable them to comply with their own employment processes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This information is what is called ‘sensitive’ personal information and slightly stricter data protection rules apply to it. We therefore need to obtain your explicit consent before we can use it. We'll ask for your consent by offering you an opt-in. This means that you have to explicitly and clearly tell us that you agree to us collecting and using this information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you are not happy about this, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time and you can find out how to do so by contacting <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>In more unusual circumstances, we may use your personal data to help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CLIENT DATA:</strong> We use Client information for:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Recruitment Activities;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Recruitment Activities</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, our main area of work is recruitment, through providing you with Candidates.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- To perform certain legal obligations;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- To help us to target appropriate marketing campaigns; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- In more unusual circumstances, to help us to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">- If our Candidates or Staff members put you down on our form as an emergency contact, we'll contact you in the case of an accident or emergency affecting them;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- If you were put down by our Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as a referee, we will contact you in order to take up a reference. This is an important part of our Candidate quality assurance process, and could be the difference between the individual getting a job or not; or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- If you were put down by our Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as a referee, we may sometimes use your details to contact you in relation to recruitment activities that we think may be of interest to you, in which case we will use your data for the same purposes for which we use the data of Clients.

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WHO DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL DATA WITH?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>Where appropriate we may share your personal data, in various ways and for various reasons, with the following categories of people:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Any of our group companies;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Individuals and organizations who hold information related to your reference or application to work with us, such as current, past or prospective employers, educators and examining bodies and employment and recruitment agencies;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Tax, audit, or other authorities, when we believe in good faith that the law or other regulation requires us to share this data (for example, because of a request by a tax authority or in connection with any anticipated litigation);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (including external consultants, business associates and professional advisers such as lawyers, auditors and accountants, technical support functions and IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business technology systems);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Third party outsourced IT and document storage providers where we have an appropriate processing agreement (or similar protections) in place;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- Marketing technology platforms and suppliers;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- In the case of Candidates: potential employers and other recruitment agencies/organisations to increase your chances of finding employment;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- In the case of Candidates: third party partners, job boards and job aggregators where we consider this will improve the chances of finding you the right job;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- In the case of Candidates and our Candidates' and prospective members of Staff's referees: third parties who we have retained to provide services such as reference, qualification and criminal convictions checks, to the extent that these checks are appropriate and in accordance with local laws;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- If GRS Global Recruitment Solutions merges with or is acquired by another business or company in the future, (or is in meaningful discussions about such a possibility) we may share your personal data with the (prospective) new owners of the business or company.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HOW DO WE SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL DATA?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong></strong>We are committed to taking all reasonable and appropriate steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, or unauthorized access. We do this by having in place a range of appropriate technical and organizational measures. These include measures to deal with any suspected data breach.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you suspect any misuse or loss of or unauthorized access to your personal information, please let us know immediately by contacting us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will Delete your personal data from our systems if we have not had any meaningful contact with you (or, where appropriate, the company you are working for or with) for two years (or for such longer period as we believe in good faith that the law or relevant regulators require us to preserve your data). After this period, it is likely your data will no longer be relevant for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">For those Candidates whose services are provided via a third party company or other entity, "meaningful contact" with you means meaningful contact with the company or entity which supplies your services. Where we are notified by such company or entity that it no longer has that relationship with you, we will retain your data for no longer than two years from that point or, if later, for the period of two years from the point we subsequently have meaningful contact directly with you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When we refer to "meaningful contact", we mean, for example, communication between us (either verbal or written), or where you are actively engaging with our online services. If you are a Candidate, we will consider there to be meaningful contact with you if you submit your updated CV to us. We will also consider it meaningful contact if you communicate with us about potential roles, either by verbal or written communication or respond to any of our marketing communications. Your receipt, opening or reading of an email or other digital message from us will not count as meaningful contact.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HOW CAN YOU ACCESS, AMEND OR TAKE BACK THE PERSONAL DATA THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN TO US?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the GDPR's main objectives is to protect and clarify the rights of EU citizens and individuals in the EU with regards to data privacy. This means that you retain various rights in respect of your data, even once you have given it to us. These are described in more detail below.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To get in touch about these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a>. We will seek to deal with your request without undue delay, and in any event within one month (subject to any extensions to which we are lawfully entitled). Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right to object: this right enables you to object to us processing your personal data where we do so for one of the following four reasons: (i) our legitimate interests; (ii) to enable us to perform a task in the public interest or exercise official authority; (iii) to send you direct marketing materials; and (iv) for scientific, historical, research, or statistical purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The "legitimate interests" and "direct marketing" categories above are the ones most likely to apply to our Website Users, Candidates, Clients and Suppliers. If your objection relates to us processing your personal data because we deem it necessary for your legitimate interests, we must act on your objection by ceasing the activity in question unless:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- we can show that we have compelling legitimate grounds for processing which overrides your interests; or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- we are processing your data for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your objection relates to direct marketing, we must act on your objection by ceasing this activity.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to withdraw consent:</strong></span> Where we have obtained your consent to process your personal data for certain activities (for example, to find a job), you may withdraw this consent at any time and we will cease to carry out the particular activity that you previously consented to unless we consider that there is an alternative reason to justify our continued processing of your data for this purpose in which case we will inform you of this condition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR):</strong></span> You may ask us to confirm what information we hold about you at any time, and request us to modify, update or Delete such information. We may ask you to verify your identity and for more information about your request. If we provide you with access to the information we hold about you, we will not charge you for this unless your request is "manifestly unfounded or excessive". If you request further copies of this information from us, we may charge you a reasonable administrative cost where legally permissible. Where we are legally permitted to do so, we may refuse your request. If we refuse your request, we will always tell you the reasons for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to erasure:</strong></span> You have the right to request that we erase your personal data in certain circumstances. Normally, the information must meet one of the following criteria:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- the data are no longer necessary for the purpose for which we originally collected and/or processed them;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- where previously given, you have withdrawn your consent to us processing your data, and there is no other valid reason for us to continue processing;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- the data has been processed unlawfully (i.e. in a manner which does not comply with the GDPR);</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- it is necessary for the data to be erased in order for us to comply with our legal obligations as a data controller; or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- if we process the data because we believe it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests, you object to the processing and we are unable to demonstrate overriding legitimate grounds for our continued processing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We would only be entitled to refuse to comply with your request for one of the following reasons:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- to comply with legal obligations or for the performance of a public interest task or exercise of official authority;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- for public health reasons in the public interest;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- for archival, research or statistical purposes; or</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- to exercise or defend a legal claim.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>When complying with a valid request for the erasure of data we will take all reasonably practicable steps to Delete the relevant data.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to restrict processing:</strong></span> You have the right to request that we restrict our processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This means that we can only continue to store your data and will not be able to carry out any further processing activities with it until either:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">(i) one of the circumstances listed below is resolved; (ii) you consent; or (iii) further processing is necessary for either the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, the protection of the rights of another individual, or reasons of important EU or Member State public interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The circumstances</strong> <strong>in which you are entitled to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data are:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- where you dispute the accuracy of the personal data that we are processing about you. In this case, our processing of your personal data will be restricted for the period during which the accuracy of the data is verified;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- where you object to our processing of your personal data for our legitimate interests. Here, you can request that the data be restricted while we verify our grounds for processing your personal data;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- where our processing of your data is unlawful, but you would prefer us to restrict our processing of it rather than erasing it; and</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- where we have no further need to process your personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If we have shared your personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the restricted processing unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. We will, of course, notify you before lifting any restriction on processing your personal data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right to rectification:</strong></span> You also have the right to request that we rectify any inaccurate or incomplete personal data that we hold about you. If we have shared this personal data with third parties, we will notify them about the rectification unless this is impossible or involves disproportionate effort. Where appropriate, we will also tell you which third parties we have disclosed the inaccurate or incomplete personal data to. Where we think that it is reasonable for us not to comply with your request, we will explain our reasons for this decision.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Right</strong><strong> of data portability:</strong></span>  If you wish, you have the right to transfer your personal data between data controllers. In effect, this means that you are able to transfer your GRS Global Recruitment Solutions account details to another online platform. To allow you to do so, we will provide you with your data in electronic format that is password-protected so that you can transfer the data to another online platform. Alternatively, we may directly transfer the data for you. This right of data portability applies</p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>(i) personal data that we process automatically (i.e. without any human intervention); (ii) personal data provided by you; and (iii) personal data that we process based on your consent or in order to <span style="color: inherit; font-size: inherit;">fulfil a contract</span><span style="font-size: 10px;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority: You also have the right to lodge a complaint with the Local Supervisory Authority of Cyprus or Malta.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you would like to exercise any of these rights, or withdraw your consent to the processing of your personal data (where consent is our legal basis for processing your personal data), contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a>. Please note that we may keep a record of your communications to help us resolve any issues which you raise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You may ask to unsubscribe from job e-shots at any time by contacting us <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes during the period for which we hold your data.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING YOUR PERSONAL DATA ON THE GRS GLOBAL RECRUITMENT SOLUTIONS WEBSITE?</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GRS Global Recruitment Solutions Ltd (legal name GRS Professional Recruitment Services Ltd) is solely responsible for processing all your data. Please contact our Limassol office Agathengeou Business Centre, 101 Gladstonos Street, Limassol, Cyprus or email us <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a> for further information.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have any comments or suggestions concerning this Privacy Policy, please email <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a> We take privacy seriously so we'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>COOKIES POLICY</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What's a cookie?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A "cookie" is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive and which records your navigation of a website so that, when you revisit that website, it can present tailored options based on the information stored about your last visit. Cookies can also be used to analyse traffic and for advertising and marketing purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Cookies are used by nearly all websites and do not harm your system. If you want to check or change what types of cookies you accept, this can usually be altered within your browser settings. We do not use your cookies for any purpose whatsoever.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>OUR LEGAL BASES FOR PROCESSING YOUR DATA</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>LEGITIMATE INTERESTS</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR is the one that is relevant here – it says that we can process your data where it "is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by [us] or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights or freedoms of [you] which require protection of personal data."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We don't think that any of the following activities prejudice individuals in any way – in fact, they help us to offer you a more tailored, efficient service. However, you do have the right to object to us processing your personal data on this basis. If you would like to know more about how to do so, please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CANDIDATE DATA:</strong><br />We think it's reasonable to expect that if you are looking for employment or have posted your professional CV information on a job board or professional networking site, you are happy for us to collect and otherwise use your personal data to offer or provide our recruitment services to you, share that information with prospective employers and assess your skills against our bank of vacancies. Once it's looking like you may get the job, your prospective employer may also want to double check any information you've given us (such as the results from psychometric evaluations or skills tests) or to confirm your references, qualifications and Police Criminal Record Check, to the extent that this is appropriate and in accordance with local laws. We need to do these things so that we can function as a profit-making business, and to help you and other Candidates get the jobs you deserve.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We want to provide you with tailored job recommendations and relevant articles to read to help you on your job hunt. We therefore think it's reasonable for us to process your data to make sure that we send you the most appropriate content.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have to make sure our business runs smoothly, so that we can carry on providing services to Candidates like you. We therefore also need to use your data for our internal administrative activities, like payroll and invoicing where relevant.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have our own obligations under the law, which it is a legitimate interest of ours to insist on meeting! If we believe in good faith that it is necessary, we may therefore share your data in connection with crime detection, tax collection or actual or anticipated litigation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CLIENT DATA:</strong><br />To ensure that we provide you with the best service possible, we store your personal data and/or the personal data of individual contacts at your organisation as well as keeping records of our conversations, meetings, registered jobs and placements. From time to time, we may also ask you to undertake a customer satisfaction survey. We think this is reasonable – we deem these uses of your data to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation providing various recruitment services to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>SUPPLIER DATA:</strong><br />We use and store the personal data of individuals within your organisation in order to facilitate the receipt of services from you as one of our Suppliers. We also hold your financial details, so that we can pay you for your services. We deem all such activities to be necessary within the range of our legitimate interests as a recipient of your services.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>PEOPLE WHOSE DATA WE RECEIVE FROM CANDIDATES AND STAFF, SUCH AS REFEREES AND EMERGENCY CONTACTS:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If you have been put down by a Candidate or a prospective member of Staff as one of their referees, we use your personal data in order to contact you for a reference. This is a part of our quality assurance procedure and so we deem this to be necessary for our legitimate interests as an organisation offering recruitment services and employing people ourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If a Candidate or Staff member has given us your details as an emergency contact, we will use these details to contact you in the case of an accident or emergency. We are sure you will agree that this is a vital element of our people-orientated organisation, and so is necessary for our legitimate interests.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>CONSENT</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In certain circumstances, we are required to obtain your consent to the processing of your personal data in relation to certain activities. Depending on exactly what we are doing with your information, this consent will be opt-in consent or soft opt-in consent.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Article 4(11) of the GDPR states that (opt-in) consent is "any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her." In plain language, this means that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- you have to give us your consent freely, without us putting you under any type of pressure;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- you have to know what you are consenting to – so we'll make sure we give you enough information;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- you should have control over which processing activities you consent to and which you don’t. To update us on your consent and preferences please contact us at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">- you need to take positive and affirmative action in giving us your consent and to ensure that this requirement is met in a clear and unambiguous fashion please contact us in writing at <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>We will keep records of the consents that you have given in this way.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have already mentioned that, in some cases, we will be able to rely on soft opt-in consent. We are allowed to market products or services to you which are related to the recruitment services we provide as long as you do not actively opt-out from these communications.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As we have mentioned, you have the right to withdraw your consent to these activities. You can do so at any time, and to do so please contact <a href="mailto:dpo@grsrecruitment.com">dpo@grsrecruitment.com</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ESTABLISHING, EXERCISING OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS</strong></h3>

<h3 style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10px;">GLOSSARY</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Candidates</strong></span> – includes applicants for all roles advertised or promoted by GRS Global Recruitment Solutions, including permanent, part-time and temporary positions and freelance roles with GRS Global Recruitment Solutions' Clients; as well as people who have supplied a speculative CV to GRS Global Recruitment Solutions not in relation to a specific job. Individual contractors, freelance workers and employees of suppliers or other third parties put forward for roles with GRS Global Recruitment Solutions, or otherwise will be treated as candidates for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Clients</strong></span><strong> </strong>- this category covers our customers, clients, and others to whom GRS Global Recruitment Solutions provides services in the course of its business.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Delete</strong></span> – while we will endeavor to permanently erase your personal data once it reaches the end of its retention period or where we receive a valid request from you to do so, some of your data may still exist within our systems, for example</p>
<p>if it is waiting to be overwritten. For our purposes, this data has been put beyond use, meaning that, while it still exists on an archive system, this cannot be readily accessed by any of our operational systems, processes or Staff.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong></span> – a European Union statutory instrument which aims to harmonize European data protection laws. It has an effective date of 25 May 2018, and any references to it should be construed accordingly to include any national legislation implementing it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other people whom GRS Global Recruitment Solutions may contact</strong></span> – these may include Candidates' and GRS Global Recruitment Solutions' Staff emergency contacts and referees. We will only contact them in appropriate circumstances.</p>

For these purposes we also include employees of GRS Global Recruitment Solutions who are engaged to work on Clients' premises under the terms of RPO or MSP agreements. To be clear, 'Staff' does not include individuals hired by GRS Global Recruitment Solutions for the purpose of being placed with Clients outside of an RPO/MSP arrangement. These individuals are treated in the same way as GRS Global Recruitment Solutions' Candidates and are covered by this Privacy Policy. Likewise, independent contractors and consultants performing services for GRS Global Recruitment Solutions fall within the definition of a 'Supplier' for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Suppliers</strong></span> – refers to partnerships and companies (including sole traders), and atypical workers such as independent contractors and freelance workers, who provide services to GRS Global Recruitment Solutions. In certain circumstances GRS Global Recruitment Solutions will sub-contract the services it provides to Clients to third party suppliers who perform services on GRS Global Recruitment Solutions' behalf. In this context, suppliers that are individual contractors, freelance workers, or employees of suppliers will be treated as Candidates for data protection purposes. Please note that in this context, GRS Global Recruitment Solutions requires Suppliers to communicate the relevant parts of this Privacy Policy (namely the sections directed at Candidates) to their employees.</p>
