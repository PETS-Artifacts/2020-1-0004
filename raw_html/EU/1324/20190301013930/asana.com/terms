                    <h3>Asana User Terms of Service</h3>

<p class="-label">Effective Date: November 1, 2018</p>

<p>Asana, Inc. (“Asana,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”), and websites, including but not limited to www.asana.com, wavelength.com, blog.asana.com, community.asana.com (the “<strong>Websites</strong>”).</p>

<p>Asana has three different types of users depending on the Asana products used:</p>

<ul>
<li>We call users of the Websites “<strong>Site Visitors</strong>.”</li>
<li>We call users who use the free version of the Asana Service “<strong>Free Users</strong>.”  While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.</li>
<li>We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Asana subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “<strong>Subscribers</strong>.”  The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Asana and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “Customer”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”).</li>
</ul>

<p>We refer to these three types of users collectively as “Users” or “you” for purposes of these User Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”). Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Asana and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites.  By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT NOTICE: DISPUTES ABOUT THESE TERMS AND THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES PROVIDED BY ASANA ARE SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AND A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS AS DETAILED IN THE “MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER” SECTION BELOW.</p>

<p>We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. If you do not agree to, or cannot comply with, the modified Terms, you must stop using the Service and Websites. The updated Terms will take effect upon their posting and will apply on a going-forward basis, unless otherwise provided in a notice to you, and except as provided in the Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section of these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

<h4>1. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE</h4>

<p><strong>1.1 General</strong>.  To use the Service and Websites you must be, and represent and warrant that you are, at least 13 years of age and competent to agree to these Terms. If Asana has previously prohibited you from accessing or using the Service and Websites, you are not permitted to access or use the Service and Websites.</p>

<p><strong>1.2 Location</strong>.  These Terms are applicable to Users located in the United States only.  If you are located outside of the United States, you will be presented with a different set of terms.</p>

<h4>2. ACCOUNT REGISTRATION AND USE</h4>

<p><strong>2.1 Account Registration and Confidentiality</strong>. To access the Service and Websites, you must register for an Asana account by creating a user name and password. You agree to provide us with accurate, complete, and current registration information about yourself. It is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure. By registering, you agree that you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your user name and password. We may assume that any communications we receive under your account have been made by you.  If you are a billing owner, an administrator, or if you have confirmed in writing that you have the authority to make decisions on behalf of a Customer (“<strong>Account Administrator</strong>”), you represent and warrant that you are authorized to make decisions on behalf of the Customer and agree that Asana is entitled to rely on your instructions.</p>

<p><strong>2.2 Unauthorized Account Use</strong>. You are responsible for notifying us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x74;&#x65;&#114;&#109;&#x73;&#x2d;&#113;&#117;&#x65;&#x73;&#116;&#105;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#115;&#64;&#x61;&#x73;&#97;&#110;&#x61;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">terms-questions@asana.com</a> if you become aware of any unauthorized use of or access to your account. You understand and agree that we may require you to provide information that may be used to confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your account. Asana will not be liable for any loss, damages, liability, expenses or attorneys’ fees that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, either with or without your knowledge and/or authorization, and regardless of whether you have or have not advised us of such unauthorized use. You will be liable for losses, damages, liability, expenses and attorneys’ fees incurred by Asana or a third party due to someone else using your account.  In the event that the Account Administrator or Customer loses access to an account or otherwise requests information about an account, Asana reserves the right to request from the Account Administrator or Customer any verification it deems necessary before restoring access to or providing information about such account in its sole discretion.</p>

<h4>3. OUR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h4>

<p>The Service and Websites are owned and operated by Asana and contain materials (including all software, design, text, editorial materials, informational text, photographs, illustrations, audio clips, video clips, artwork and other graphic materials, and names, logos, trademarks and services marks) which are derived in whole or in part from materials supplied by Asana and its partners, as well as other sources, and are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions, trademarks, service marks and other intellectual property laws. The Service and Websites are also protected as a collective work or compilation under U.S. copyright and other law and treaties. You agree to abide by all applicable copyright and other laws, as well as any additional copyright notices or restrictions contained in the Service and Websites. You acknowledge that the Service and Websites have been developed, compiled, prepared, revised, selected, and arranged by Asana and others through the application of methods and standards of judgment developed and applied through the expenditure of substantial time, effort, and money and constitute valuable intellectual property of Asana and such others. You agree to protect the proprietary rights of Asana and all others having rights in the Service and Websites during and after the term of these Terms and to comply with all written requests made by Asana or its suppliers and licensors (collectively, “Suppliers”) of content or otherwise to protect their and others’ contractual, statutory, and common law rights in the Service and Websites. You agree to notify Asana immediately upon becoming aware of any claim that the Service and Websites infringe upon any copyright, trademark, or other contractual, statutory, or common law rights. All present and future rights in and to trade secrets, patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, know-how, and other proprietary rights of any type under the laws of any governmental authority, domestic or foreign, including without limitation rights in and to all applications and registrations relating to the Service and Websites shall, as between you and Asana, at all times be and remain the sole and exclusive property of Asana. Any unauthorized use of any material contained on or through the Service and Websites may violate copyright laws, trademark laws, the laws of privacy and publicity and communications regulations and statutes.</p>

<h4>4. USER CONTENT AND FEEDBACK</h4>

<p><strong>4.1 User Content and Submissions on the Service</strong>. The Service allows you to create tasks and submit associated information, text, files, and other materials (collectively, “User Content”) and to share that User Content with others. User Content submitted or otherwise made available to the Service is subject to the following terms:</p>

<p><strong>4.1.1 Free User Content</strong>. Free Users maintain ownership of the User Content that they submit to the Service (“Free User Content”). By submitting Free User Content, Free Users grant Asana a license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, and display that Free User Content, as permitted by Asana’s Privacy Policy, including if required to do so by law or in good faith to comply with legal process. We reserve the right to remove any Free User Content on the Service that violates these Terms or that is otherwise objectionable in Asana’s sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>4.1.2 Subscriber User Content on the Service</strong>. Content submitted to the Service by Subscribers (“Subscriber User Content”) is owned and controlled by the Customer as set forth in the introduction to these Terms and the Customer Agreement, except with respect to Subscriber User Content submitted by students pursuant to a Customer Agreement with an educational institution (“Student Content”). Such Student Content is owned by the student and not the educational institution. Asana maintains a limited, non-exclusive and non-transferrable (except in connection with the sale or transfer of its business) license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host, and display Subscriber User Content for the following limited purposes: (i) to maintain, provide and improve the Service; (ii) to prevent or address technical or security issues and resolve support requests; (iii) to investigate when we have a good faith belief, or have received a complaint alleging, that such Subscriber User Content is in violation of the Customer Agreement or these Terms; (iv) to comply with a valid legal subpoena, request, or other lawful process that meets the requirements of the Customer Agreement and our <a href="#law-enforcement-guidelines">Law Enforcement Guidelines</a>; and (v) as otherwise set forth in our Customer Agreement or as expressly permitted in writing by the Customer.</p>

<p><strong>4.2 Feedback on the Websites</strong>. The Websites may have certain features that allow you to submit comments, information, and other materials (collectively, “Feedback”) to Asana and share such Feedback with other users, or the public. By submitting Feedback through the Websites, you grant Asana a license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host, and display that Feedback for any purpose (including in testimonials or other Asana marketing materials and where required to do so by law or in good faith to comply with legal process.). We reserve the right to remove any Feedback posted in public forums for any reason at our sole discretion.</p>

<p><strong>4.3 User Content and Feedback Representations</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that you have all required rights to submit User Content and Feedback without violation of any third-party rights. You understand that Asana does not control, and is not responsible for, User Content or Feedback, and that by using the Service and/or Websites, you may be exposed to User Content or Feedback from other users that is offensive, indecent, inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise objectionable. Please also note that User Content and Feedback may contain typographical errors, other inadvertent errors or inaccuracies. You agree that you will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Asana for all claims resulting from User Content or Feedback you submit through the Service and/or Websites. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of such disputes, and in any event you will cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>

IN NO EVENT SHALL ASANA OR ITS AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, VENDORS, OR ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF USE, OR COSTS OF OBTAINING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, ANY MATERIALS, INFORMATION, OR RECOMMENDATIONS APPEARING ON THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, OR ANY LINK PROVIDED ON THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, WHETHER OR NOT ASANA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND WHETHER BASED UPON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, VIOLATION OF STATUTE, OR OTHERWISE. THIS EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY SHALL APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. IN ANY EVENT, OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE SERVICE OR WEBSITES TO WHICH THE CLAIM RELATES OR, IF THE CLAIM DOES NOT RELATE TO A PRODUCT OR SERVICE, $100.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code §1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.” This release includes the criminal acts of others.</p>

<h4>8. EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS</h4>

<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages such as above in Section 7. Accordingly, some of the above limitations may not apply to you. If you are a New Jersey resident, or a resident of another state that permits the exclusion of these warranties and liabilities, then the limitations in Section 7 specifically do apply to you.</p>

<h4>9. INDEMNITY</h4>

<p>YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND, AND HOLD ASANA AND ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS, SHAREHOLDERS, CONTRACTORS, OR REPRESENTATIVES (AND ALL SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING), HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ANY CLAIM OR DEMAND, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND DISBURSEMENTS, MADE BY ANY THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, YOUR CONNECTION TO THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, YOUR VIOLATION OF THE TERMS OR ASANA’S PRIVACY POLICY, YOUR VIOLATION OF AN APPLICABLE LAW, YOUR SUBMISSION, POSTING, OR TRANSMISSION OF USER CONTENT TO THE SERVICE AND WEBSITES, AND/OR YOUR VIOLATION OF ANY RIGHTS OF ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, AT OUR OWN EXPENSE, TO ASSUME THE EXCLUSIVE DEFENSE AND CONTROL OF SUCH DISPUTES, AND IN ANY EVENT YOU WILL COOPERATE WITH US IN ASSERTING ANY AVAILABLE DEFENSES.</p>

<h4>10. THIRD-PARTY LINKS AND SERVICE AND WEBSITES</h4>

<p>The Service and Websites may provide (1) information and content provided by third parties; (2) links to third-party websites or resources, such as sellers of goods and services; and (3) third-party products and services for sale directly to you. Asana is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for (i) any content, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources, (ii) any errors or omissions in these websites or resources, or (iii) any information handling practices or other business practices of the operators of such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that Asana shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any linked sites or resources. Your interactions with such third parties will be governed by the third parties’ own terms of service and privacy policies, and any other similar terms.</p>

<h4>11. MODIFICATION</h4>

<p>Asana reserves the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service and Websites (or any part thereof), with or without notice. You agree that Asana shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service and Websites.</p>

<h4>12. MANDATORY ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>

<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.</p>

<p><strong>12.1 Application</strong>. You and Asana agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of these arbitration provisions. This Section 12 is intended to be interpreted broadly and governs any and all disputes between us including but not limited to claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; claims that arose before these Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims related to advertising); and claims that may arise after the termination of these Terms. The only disputes excluded from this broad prohibition are the litigation of certain intellectual property and small court claims, as provided below.</p>

<p><strong>12.2. Initial Dispute Resolution</strong>. Most disputes can be resolved without resort to arbitration. If you have any dispute with us, you agree that before taking any formal action, you will contact us at dispute-notice@asana.com and provide a brief, written description of the dispute and your contact information (including your username, if your dispute relates to an account). Except for intellectual property and small claims court claims, the parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation with Asana, and good faith negotiations shall be a condition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>12.3 Binding Arbitration</strong>. If the parties do not reach an agreed-upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is initiated under the Initial Dispute Resolution provision above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, (except as provided in section 12.7 below) subject to the terms set forth below. Specifically, all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including the Terms’ formation, performance, and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other, and/or your use of Asana shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (“JAMS”). The JAMS rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Asana will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award. Asana will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>

<p><strong>12.4 Arbitrator’s Powers</strong>. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms including but not limited to any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable, whether a claim is subject to arbitration, or the question of waiver by litigation conduct. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be written and shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>12.5 Filing a Demand</strong>. To start an arbitration, you must do the following: (a) Write a Demand for Arbitration (“Demand”) that (i) briefly explains the dispute, (ii) lists your and Asana’s names and addresses, (iii) specify the amount of money in dispute, if applicable, (iv) identify the requested location for a hearing if an in-person hearing is requested, and (v) state what you want in the dispute; (b) send one copy of the Demand to JAMS, along with a copy of these Terms and the filing fee required by JAMS; and (c) Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to us at dispute-notice@asana.com.</p>

<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory arbitration provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court. If you are a resident of the United States, arbitration may take place in the county where you reside at the time of filing, unless you and we both agree to another location or telephonic arbitration. For individuals residing outside the United States, arbitration shall be initiated in San Francisco County, California, United States, and you and Asana agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court in San Francisco County, California, United States, in order to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

<p><strong>12.6 Class Action Waiver</strong>. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in the party’s respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. YOU AND ASANA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provisions set forth above shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</p>

<p><strong>12.7 Exception: Litigation of Intellectual Property and Small Claims Court Claims</strong>. Notwithstanding the parties’ decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may bring enforcement actions, validity determinations or claims arising from or relating to theft, piracy or unauthorized use of intellectual property in state or federal court with jurisdiction or in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property rights (“intellectual property rights” means patents, copyrights, moral rights, trademarks, and trade secrets, but not privacy or publicity rights). Either party may also seek relief in small claims court in San Francisco, California for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</p>

<p><strong>12.8 30-Day Right to Opt Out</strong>. You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth above by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x64;&#105;&#115;&#x70;&#117;&#116;&#x65;&#45;&#x6e;&#x6f;&#116;&#x69;&#x63;&#101;&#x40;a&#115;&#x61;&#110;&#97;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">dispute-notice@asana.com</a> with the subject line, “ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER OPT-OUT.” The notice must be sent within the later of 30 days of your first use of the Service or within 30 days of changes to this section being announced on the Site. Otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of these paragraphs. If you opt out of these arbitration provisions, Asana also will not be bound by them.</p>

<p><strong>12.9 Changes to This Section</strong>. Asana will provide thirty (30) days’ notice of any changes to this section by posting on the Service and Websites. Amendments will become effective thirty (30) days after they are posted on the Service and Websites or sent to you by email. Changes to this section will otherwise apply prospectively only to claims arising after the thirtieth (30th) day. If a court or arbitrator decides that this subsection on “Changes to This Section” is not enforceable or valid, then this subsection shall be severed from the section entitled Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver, and the court or arbitrator shall apply the first Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section in existence after you began using the Service and Websites.</p>

<p><strong>12.10 Survival</strong>. This Mandatory Arbitration and Class Action Waiver section shall survive any termination of your use of the Service and Websites.</p>

<h4>13. CONTROLLING LAW AND SEVERABILITY</h4>

<p>These Terms shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of California notwithstanding its conflicts of law principles. Any dispute arising out of these terms and conditions or the use of this site shall be initiated and conducted in the state or federal courts of San Francisco County, California, and you and Asana consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.</p>

<h4>14. GENERAL TERMS</h4>

<p><strong>14.1 Force Majeure</strong>. Under no circumstances shall Asana or its licensor or supplier be held liable for any delay or failure in performance resulting directly or indirectly from an event beyond its reasonable control.</p>

<p><strong>14.2 No Waiver</strong>. No waiver of any provision of these Terms will be binding unless in writing, no waiver of any provisions of these Terms will be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and the failure of Asana to exercise or enforce any right or remedy in these Terms does not waive that right or remedy. If an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms to be invalid, the parties agree that the court should endeavor to give effect, to the maximum extent permitted by law, to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p><strong>14.3 Third-Party Beneficiaries</strong>. You agree that, except as otherwise expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>

<p><strong>14.4 Statute of Limitations</strong>. Except for residents of New Jersey, you agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to the use of the Service and Websites and/or these Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.</p>

<p><strong>14.5 Miscellaneous</strong>. These Terms (and all terms and conditions incorporated herein) constitute the entire agreement between you and Asana and govern your use of the Service and Websites, and supersede any prior agreements between you and Asana on the subject matter. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may not be assigned or delegated by you. These Terms, and any rights or licenses granted hereunder, may be assigned or delegated by Asana without restriction. These Terms bind and inure to the benefit of each party and the party’s successors and permitted assigns. These Terms may not be modified by an oral statement by a representative of Asana. No agency, partnership, joint venture or employee-employer relationship is intended or created by these Terms. You agree that any agreements made by and between you and us in electronic form are as legally binding as if made in physical written form. If you are using the Service and Websites for or on behalf of the U.S. government, your license rights do not exceed those granted to non-government consumers. The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Any provision of these Terms that by its nature is reasonably intended to survive beyond termination of these Terms shall survive.</p>

<p><strong>14.6 Notices</strong>. We may deliver notice to you by e-mail, posting a notice on the Service and Websites or any other method we choose and such notice will be effective on dispatch.

<h4>II. Privacy Terms for Subscribers<a id="privacy-subscribers"></a></h4>

<p><strong>A.    Overview</strong></p>

<p>Section II of this Policy applies only to <strong>Subscribers</strong>.
If you are a Subscriber, the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>” governs the collection and processing of information collected from you through the Customer’s instance of the Service (e.g. a Customer&#8217;s organization or workspace, but for purposes of this Policy referred to as the “<strong>Workspace</strong>”), including all associated messages, attachments, files, tasks, projects and project names, team names, channels, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“<strong>Workspace Content</strong>”).   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement, the Customer Agreement governs.
Because the Customer controls the Workspace used by Subscribers, if you have any questions about the Customer’s specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use.
If you are a Subscriber located in the European Union, please note that the Customer is the data controller with respect to the processing of your Workspace Content pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).  When processing Workspace Content of EU data subjects governed by the Customer Agreement, Asana is the data processor, meaning that we collect and process such information solely on behalf of the Customer.</p>

<p><strong>B.    Collection and Use of Subscriber Information</strong></p>

<p>This section explains the information we collect from Subscribers.  We do not require Subscribers to provide us with information.  However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Workspace Content</strong>. Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by Asana in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law.  The Customer, and not Asana, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect the Workspace Content that you provide when using the Service.</li>
<li><strong>Account Information</strong>.  To set up your Asana account, you or the Customer will provide us with basic information about you which may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, and password.  You will then have the ability to provide optional profile information, such as a photograph or basic demographic data.  With your permission, we may also upload calendar information stored on your mobile device to your account.  If you submit payment information in connection with your use of the Service, we utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address, and phone number.  In such circumstances, the third party service provider, and not Asana, stores your payment information on our behalf.</li>
<li><strong>Service Usage Information</strong>.  As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”).  Such information includes:

<ul>
<li>Device information – when you access the Service using a mobile device, we collect certain device information, including the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</li>
<li>Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files. These log files may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, date and time stamp information, language preferences, data from cookies and similar technologies, and other such information.</li>
<li>Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</li>
<li>Workspace Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Workspace.  For example, we may log the number of Workspaces you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; the types of files you share; and what, if any, third party services and integrations you use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other Information</strong>. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); information you provide in connection with Asana sweepstakes, contests, or research studies in which you choose to participate; beta testing; and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).</li>
<li><strong>Information Collected from Third-Party Integrations</strong>.  If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g., OneDrive, Unito, Wufoo, Slack) through the Service, or if you are required or permitted to do so by a Customer, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service.  If you initiate these connections, you also understand that we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections.  By enabling these connections, you authorize us to connect and access the information provided through these connections, and you understand that the privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections.</li>
</ol>

</ul></li>

<h4>IV. Privacy Terms for Site Visitors<a id="privacy-visitors"></a></h4>

<p><strong>A.    Overview</strong></p>

<p>Section IV of this Policy applies only to Site Visitors.</p>

<p>If you visit the Websites, regardless of whether you are also a user of the Service, the following rules apply to you.  To eliminate any confusion, please note that the terms in this section apply only to use of Asana’s Websites, not to use of the Service.</p>

<p>If you are a Site Visitor located in the European Union, Asana is the data controller with respect to the processing of your personal data pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).</p>

<p><strong>B.    Collection and Use of Site Visitor Information</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Information Collected from Site Visitors</p>

<p>When you use the Websites, we collect the following information about you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact Information – if you submit a request for information or a question through the Websites, you may be asked to provide us with basic information including your name, email address, phone number, and postal address.  We will also keep records of the communication, the question/request you raised, and how it was resolved.  If you choose to participate in an Asana sweepstakes, contest, or research study offered through the Websites, we will also collect basic contact information from you in connection with such activity.</li>
<li>Websites Usage Information – as you browse the Websites, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf to provide and enhance the Websites) use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting information about how you use the Websites.  For example, our servers automatically record certain information in server logs. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Websites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, mobile device identifiers and information about the device you are using to access the Websites, date and time stamp information and other such information.</li>
<li>Location Information – We collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>

<p>To collect the Websites Usage Information discussed above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand which pages of the Websites you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).</p></li>
<li><p>Use of Information Collected from Site Visitors</p>

<p>We use the information collected from Site Visitors for a variety of purposes including to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain, provide, and improve the Websites and the Service</li>
<li>Respond to your requests for information</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable legal obligations, communicate with you about promotions, offers, and news about Asana.  You have the ability to unsubscribe from such promotional communications</li>
<li>Prevent or address technical or security issues</li>
<li>Investigate in good faith alleged violations of our <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a></li>
<li>Help us better understand Site Visitor interests and needs, and customize the advertising and content you see on the Websites</li>
<li>Engage in analysis and research regarding use of the Websites and the Service</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C.    Legal Bases</strong></p>

<p>If you are located in the EU, please note that the legal bases under the GDPR for using the information we collect through your use of the Websites as a Site Visitor are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with the <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a> which you accept by browsing the Websites)</li>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our Websites; operate our Websites; prevent fraud, analyze use of and improve our Websites, and for similar purposes)</li>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation</li>
<li>Where we have your consent to process data in a certain way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>D.    Aggregate/De-Identified Data</strong></p>

<p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Websites so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>

<p><strong>E.    Combined Information</strong></p>

<p>You agree that, for the purposes discussed in this Policy, we may combine the information that we collect through the Websites with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Policy.  If, however, the collection of any information about you is governed by a Customer Agreement, information will only be combined and used in accordance with such Customer Agreement and the sections of this Policy applicable to Subscribers.</p>

<p><strong>F.    Website Analytics and Advertising</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Website Analytics
We may use third-party web analytics services on our Websites to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</li>
<li><p>Online Advertising
The Websites may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Websites, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Websites, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our Websites and other websites and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Websites. We sometimes provide Site Visitor information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites.</p>

<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Websites by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings</a> page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Websites, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p></li>
<li>Notice Concerning Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>G.    Sharing of Site Visitor Information</strong></p>

<p>We share the information we collect through the Websites with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Affiliates and Subsidiaries. We may share the information we collect within the Asana family of companies.</li>
<li>Service Providers. We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties that use the information only to perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation sales, marketing, provision of content and features, advertising, analytics, research, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and other services.</li>
<li>Business Transfers. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the Websites can continue to operate. In such case, your information would remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Policy until such time as this Policy is updated or amended by the acquiring party upon notice to you. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Asana will comply with such restrictions.</li>
<li>Public Forums. The Websites makes it possible for you to upload and share comments or feedback publicly with other users, such as on the Asana community forum. Any information that you submit through such public features is not confidential, and Asana may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other Asana marketing materials). Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Such information can be read, collected and/or used by other users, and it could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Accordingly, please take care when using these features of the Websites.</li>
<li>Consent. We may also disclose your information to third parties with your consent to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>H.    Retention of Your Information</strong></p>

<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>I.    Data Subject Rights</strong></p>

<p>Local legal requirements (such as those in the EU) may afford you additional rights. If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Asana Contact Info” section below at any time.

Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p>

<p><strong>J.    Third Party Links And Services</strong></p>

<p>The Websites may contain links to third-party websites and functionalities. If you choose to use these third party services, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Asana, Asana is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.</p>

<h4>V.  Additional Privacy Terms for All Users<a id="privacy-all"></a></h4>

<p>The following additional information about Asana’s privacy practices apply to all users of Asana (Subscribers, Free Users, and Site Visitors).</p>

<p><strong>A.    International Users</strong></p>

<p>Asana complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Asana has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>. In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Asana commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal data. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Asana at: privacy@asana.com. Asana has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Privacy Shield, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Asana, please visit the BBB EU Privacy Shield web site at <a href="https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/">https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a> for more information and to file a complaint. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. Asana is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to its compliance with the provisions of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield.</p>

<p>We may transfer information that we collect about you to third party processors across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. Asana will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. Asana is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>B.    Changes To Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service or Websites, or advances in technology. We will make the revised Policy accessible through the Service and Websites, so you should review the Policy periodically. If we make a material change to the Policy, we will comply with applicable legal requirements regarding providing you with notice and/or consent.</p>

<p><strong>C.    How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>

<p>Asana takes technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.</p>

<p><strong>D.    Marketing Practices and Choices</strong></p>

<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.  You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us at the “Asana Contact Info” section below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational or service-related emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p>

<p><strong>E.    California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

<p>California law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined by applicable California law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, Asana does not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>

<h4>3   Fees and Payment.</h4>

<p><strong>3.1   Subscription Fees.</strong> Customer’s Subscription fees are set forth in the applicable Order Form and are based on the number of End Users and version of the Service purchased. Customer shall pay all fees when due and is responsible for providing complete and accurate billing information to Asana. If such fees are being paid via credit card or other electronic means, Customer authorizes Asana to charge such fees using Customer’s selected payment method.  Payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable unless otherwise provided herein. The number of End Users purchased under a Subscription cannot be decreased during the applicable Subscription Term. If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer shall provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase. Where Customer designates use of a third-party payment processor network (such as a payment agent, for example), Customer shall be responsible for payment of all fees and charges associated with use of such network. Asana reserves the right to suspend Customer’s account, in addition to all of its other available rights and remedies, in the event that Customer’s account becomes overdue. Suspension shall not relieve Customer’s obligation to pay amounts due.</p>

<p><strong>3.2   Auto-renewal.</strong> Customer agrees that its Subscription will automatically renew on an annual or monthly basis depending on Customer’s Subscription (the “Renewal Date”). Customer authorizes Asana to automatically charge Customer for the applicable fees on or after the Renewal Date unless the Subscription has been terminated or cancelled in accordance with this Agreement. If Customer wishes to reduce the number of End Users in its Subscription, it must do so prior to the Renewal Date. Customer must cancel its Subscription prior to the Renewal Date in order to avoid billing of the next period’s Subscription fees. Customer can cancel its Subscription anytime online by going into its account settings and following the instructions provided. If Customer chooses to cancel its Subscription during the Subscription Term, Customer may use the Service until the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term, but will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged fees.</p>

<p><strong>3.3   Calculation.</strong> Subscription fees are based on annual or monthly periods (or pro rata portions thereof, calculated on a daily basis) that begin on the Subscription start date and each annual or monthly anniversary thereof. Subscriptions to the Service are sold on a tiered basis based on the number of End Users. Customer shall purchase a Subscription to the Service for each End User, and the initial number of End Users and tier is reflected in the applicable Order Form. Customer may add End Users to its Subscription at any time on written notice to Asana (email notice acceptable). Asana reserves the right to calculate the total number of End Users periodically and, if the number of End Users exceeds Customer’s current Subscription, then Asana reserves the right to invoice Customer for the applicable tier on a pro rata basis for the remaining period in Customer’s Subscription Term, so that all End User Subscription Terms coincide and are co-terminus. Asana reserves the right to revise fee rates and/or the billable amount structure for the Service at any time and will provide Customer with notice pursuant to Section 11.4 below) of any such changes at least twenty (20) days prior. Asana may charge Customer the then-current pricing for the applicable Subscription if the number of End Users is modified and/or if Customer changes its Subscription plan.</p>

<p><strong>3.4   Taxes.</strong> Any fees charged to Customer are exclusive of taxes. Except for those taxes based on Asana’s net income, Customer shall be responsible for all applicable taxes in connection with this Agreement including, but not limited to, sales, use, excise, value-added, goods and services, consumption, and other similar taxes or duties. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, Customer shall reimburse Asana for such withholding tax.</p>

<p><strong>3.5   Future Features and Functionality.</strong> Customer agrees that any purchases under this Agreement are not contingent on the delivery of any future feature or functionality or dependent on any oral or written public or private comments made by Asana regarding future features or functionality. Asana may release Improvements and other features and functionality in its discretion. Some features and functionality may be available only with certain versions of the Service.</p>

<p><strong>4 Term and Termination.</strong> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until all Subscriptions to the Service granted in accordance with this Agreement have expired or been terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (a) is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within twenty (20) days following receipt of written notice from the non-breaching party, except that termination will take effect on notice in the event of a breach of Section 1.3 (“Usage Restrictions”); or (b) ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, all Subscriptions and any other rights granted to Customer under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Asana may immediately deactivate Customer’s account(s) associated with the Agreement. In no event will any termination relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any fees accrued or payable to Asana. The following sections shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement: Sections 1.3 (“Usage Restrictions”), 2 (“Warranties”), 3.1 (“Subscription Fees”), 3.4 (“Taxes”), 4 (“Term and Termination”), 5 (“Confidentiality”), 6 (“Intellectual Property Rights”), 7 (“Indemnification”), 8 (“Liability”), 9 (“Export Compliance”), 10 (“Use Outside the United States of America”), 11 (“Miscellaneous”), and 12 (“Definitions”).</p>

<h4>5   Confidentiality.</h4>

<p><strong>5.1   Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> During the course of performance under this Agreement, each party may make available to the other party information that is not generally known to the public and at the time of disclosure is either identified as, or should reasonably be understood by the receiving party to be, proprietary or confidential (the “Confidential Information”). Confidential Information specifically includes, but is not limited to, the Service, any Order Form(s) entered into by the parties, Customer Data, Results, business plans, product plans and roadmaps, strategies, forecasts, projects and analyses, financial information and fee structures, business processes, methods and models, and technical documentation.

<p><strong>5.2   Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement, with the express prior written consent of the disclosing party, or as required by law, the receiving party will not disclose, transmit, or otherwise disseminate to a third party any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.  The receiving party will use the same care and discretion with respect to the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party as it uses with its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its employees, Affiliates, consultants, subcontractors, agents, or advisors (“Representatives”) who have a strict need to access the Confidential Information for the purpose of performing under this Agreement and only to those who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information upon terms at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. Either party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to potential parties to a bona fide fundraising, acquisition, or similar transaction solely for purposes of the proposed transaction, provided that any such potential party is subject to written non-disclosure obligations and limitations on use no less protective than those set forth herein.</p>

<p><strong>5.3   Equitable Relief.</strong> The receiving party acknowledges that the remedy at law for breach of this Section 5 may be inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedy the disclosing party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions (without the requirement of posting a bond, other security or any similar requirement or proving any actual damages), to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Section 5 by the receiving party or any of its Representatives and to enforce the terms and provisions of this Section 5 in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing party is entitled at law or in equity.</p>

<p><strong>5.4   Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The receiving party may access and disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party if legally required to do so in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding; provided, however, that in such event the receiving party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, notify the disclosing party within a reasonable time prior to such access or disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party an opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures. If the receiving party is compelled by law to access or disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for the reasonable costs of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information. Receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, and any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>5.5   Sensitive/Personal Information.</strong> Customer agrees that it shall not use the Service to send or store personal information subject to special regulatory or contractual handling requirements (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and any similar data protection laws) including without limitation: credit card information, credit card numbers and magnetic stripe information, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, government issued identification numbers, health-related information, biometric data, financial account information, personally identifiable information collected from children under the age of 13 or from online services directed toward children, and real time geo-location data which can identify an individual, or information deemed “sensitive” under applicable law (such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or philosophical beliefs).</p>

<p><strong>6.2   By Asana.</strong> Asana owns and will continue to own all right, title, and interest, including all related Intellectual Property Rights, in and to its Confidential Information, Results, and the Service, including any enhancements, customizations, or modifications thereto.

<p><strong>6.3   Suggestions.</strong> Asana welcomes feedback from its customers about the Service and Professional Services. If Customer (including any End User) provides Asana with any feedback or suggestions regarding the Service or Professional Services (“Feedback”), Asana may use, disclose, reproduce, sublicense, or otherwise distribute and exploit the Feedback without restriction or any obligation to Customer or any End User provided that Asana shall not identify Customer or any End User as the source of such Feedback.</p>

<h4>7   Indemnification.</h4>

<p><strong>7.1   By Customer.</strong> Customer shall defend Asana, its Affiliates, and their employees, officers, and directors (together, the “Asana Indemnified Parties”) from and against third party claims, actions, and demands arising from allegations that Customer Data, unauthorized use of the Service by Customer or its End Users, or Asana’s processing of data pursuant to Customer’s instructions infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Right or privacy right (each, a “Claim Against Asana”), and Customer shall indemnify and hold the Asana Indemnified Parties harmless against any damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs finally awarded against Asana Indemnified Parties as a result of, or for any amounts paid by the Asana Indemnified Parties under a Customer-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Asana.</p>

<p><strong>7.2   By Asana.</strong>  Asana shall defend Customer, its Affiliates, and their employees, officers, and directors (together the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against third party claims, actions, and demands alleging that Customer’s authorized use of the Service infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of that third party (each, a “Claim Against Customer”), and Asana shall indemnify and hold the Customer Indemnified Parties harmless against any damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs finally awarded against Customer Indemnified Parties as a result of, or for any amounts paid by the Customer Indemnified Parties under an Asana-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Customer; provided, however, in no event will Asana have any obligations or liability under this Section 7.2 to the extent a Claim Against Customer arises from: (a) Customer or any End User’s use of the Service other than as permitted under this Agreement; or (b) use of the Service in a modified form or in combination with products, services, content, or data not furnished to Customer by Asana.</p>

<p><strong>7.3   Potential Infringement.</strong>  If the Service becomes, or in Asana’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Asana may in its sole discretion: (a) obtain the right, at Asana’s expense, for Customer to continue using the Service; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Service so that it is no longer infringing. If Asana, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Asana may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service, in which case Asana’s sole liability (in addition to its obligations under Section 7.2) shall be to provide Customer with a prorated refund of any prepaid, unused fees applicable to the remaining portion of the Subscription Term. Sections 7.2 and 7.3 state Asana’s sole liability and the Customer Indemnified Parties’ exclusive remedy for infringement claims.</p>

<p><strong>7.4   Indemnification Process.</strong> The party seeking indemnification shall provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and shall promptly provide the indemnifying party with all information and assistance reasonably requested and otherwise cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. Failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The indemnifying party shall have full control and authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment shall require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>

<h4>8   Liability.</h4>

<p><strong>8.1   Limitation of Liability.</strong> EXCEPT FOR A PARTY’S INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7 (“INDEMNIFICATION”), IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY’S OR ITS AFFILIATES’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY) EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER IN THE 12 MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE FIRST EVENT GIVING RISE TO LIABILITY.</p>

THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

<p><strong>8.3</strong> The provisions of this Section 8 allocate the risks under this Agreement between the parties, and the parties have relied on these limitations in determining whether to enter into this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>9 Export Compliance.</strong> The Service may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Customer represents that neither it nor any of its End Users are named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Customer shall not permit any End User to access or use any Service in a U.S.-embargoed country or region or in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation. Customer and its End Users shall not use the Service to export, re-export, transfer, or make available, whether directly or indirectly, any regulated item or information to anyone outside the U.S. in connection with this Agreement without first complying with all export control laws and regulations that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any country or organization of nations within whose jurisdiction Customer operates or does business.</p>

<p><strong>10    Use Outside the United States of America.</strong> The Service is controlled and operated by Asana from its offices in the United States of America. Except as explicitly set forth herein, Asana makes no representations that the Services are appropriate for use in other jurisdictions. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with local laws. Asana may offer services in other jurisdictions that are subject to different terms and conditions. In such instances, the terms and conditions governing those non-U.S. services shall take precedence over any conflicting provisions in this Agreement.</p>

<h4>11  Miscellaneous.</h4>

<p><strong>11.1  Prior Versions.</strong> If you were an existing Customer prior to November 30, 2018, the prior version of this Agreement you agreed to when subscribing to the Service will continue to apply to you until you are otherwise notified in accordance with the terms of that agreement.</p>

<p><strong>11.2  Governing Law; Venue.</strong> This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.</p>

<p><strong>11.3  Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</strong>  The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity or termination, shall be resolved according to California law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS. If the parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator experienced in the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator shall provide detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of any award. Judgment upon any such award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of Section 11.3 mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Customer may opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending written notice to Asana. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement between Customer and Asana. If Customer opts out of arbitration, Asana also will not be bound to arbitrate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as set forth in Section 5.3 (“Equitable Relief”) above and to stop unauthorized use of the Service or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. Disputes, claims, or controversies concerning either party’s Intellectual Property Rights or claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service shall not be subject to arbitration. The parties further agree that the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce any right or provisions under this Agreement, including any arbitration or court proceedings, will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

<p><strong>11.4  Notice.</strong> Asana may give general notices related to the Service that are applicable to all customers by email, text, in-app notifications, or by posting them on the Asana website or through the Service and such electronic notices shall be deemed to satisfy any legal requirement that such notices be made in writing. Other notices must be sent via email, first class, airmail, or overnight courier to the addresses of the parties provided herein or via an Order Form and are deemed given when received. Notices to Asana must be sent to Asana Legal at legal@asana.com with a copy to Asana, Inc., 1550 Bryant Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94103, Attn: Legal Dept.</p>

<p><strong>11.5  Publicity.</strong> Asana may include Customer’s name and logo in Asana’s online customer list and in print and electronic marketing materials.</p>

Customer acknowledges and understands that its participation in Beta Tests is not required and is at Customer’s own risk, and that Beta Products are made available on an “as is” basis without warranties (express or implied) of any kind, and may be discontinued or modified at any time. Beta Products are for evaluation and testing purposes, not for production use, not supported, not subject to availability or security obligations, and may be subject to additional terms. Asana shall have no liability for any harm or damage arising out of or in connection with Beta Products. The Beta Products, including without limitation Customer’s assessment of any Beta Product, are Confidential Information of Asana.</p>

<p><strong>11.7  Relationship of the Parties.</strong> The parties are and shall be independent contractors with respect to all services provided under this Agreement. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary, or employment relationship between the parties. There are no third-party beneficiaries to this Agreement. Without limiting this Section, a Customer&#8217;s End Users are not third-party beneficiaries to Customer&#8217;s rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>11.8  Force Majeure.</strong> Asana shall not be liable for delayed or inadequate performance of its obligations hereunder to the extent caused by a condition that is beyond Asana’s reasonable control, including but not limited to natural disaster, civil disturbance, acts of terrorism or war, labor conditions, governmental actions, interruption or failure of the Internet or any utility service, failures in third-party hosting services, and denial of service attacks (each a “Force Majeure Event”). Asana shall be relieved from its obligations (or part thereof) as long as the Force Majeure Event lasts and hinders the performance of said obligations (or part thereof). Asana shall promptly notify Customer and make reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event.</p>

<p><strong>11.9  Severability; No Waiver.</strong> In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to any judicial decree or decision, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a party’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<h4>What are Cookies?</h4>

<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to the browser that you use when you visit a site. The entity that places cookies on your browser can then read the information on that cookie that it set. Cookies are typically classified as either “session cookies” which do not stay on your device after you close your browser or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.
Different cookies are used to perform different functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong>: Some cookies are essential and enable you to move around the Services and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the Services. Without these cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using.

<li><strong>Personalization Cookies</strong>: We also use cookies to change the way our Services behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our Services or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered user. These cookies may be used to tailor the Services or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our Services. For example, if you personalize webpages, or use specific parts of the Services, a cookie helps our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next use the Services, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Services features that you previously chose. </li>
<li><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong>: We use our own cookies and/or third-party cookies and other identifiers (such as web beacons) to see how you use our Services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors.

They gather information about your browsing habits and remember that you have visited a website. We or our service providers may use this information to make advertisements more relevant to you.  </li>
<li><strong>Cross-Device Cookies</strong>:  Sometimes, we may use cookies in combination with the information we collect &#8212; for instance, usernames, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers &#8212; to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones or tablets), or work with service providers that do this, in order to save your preferences across devices and analyze usage of the Services.  </li>

So that we can ensure compliance with our user Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we respond only to law enforcement requests that adhere to established legal process and applicable law.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>U.S. Legal Process Requirements.</strong>
We disclose user information solely in accordance with our published Terms of Service and applicable U.S. law, including the federal Stored Communications Act (&#8220;SCA&#8221;), 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2712.  In accordance with U.S. law:

<ol>
<li>A jurisdictionally valid subpoena, issued in connection with an official criminal investigation, is required to compel the disclosure of basic user records, which may include name, length of service, credit card information (including billing address), email address(es), and an IP address, if available.</li>
<li>A court order is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or other information related to a user account (not including contents of communications), which may include message headers and IP addresses, in addition to the basic user records identified above.</li>
<li>A search warrant properly issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, based on a showing of probable cause, is required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, attachments, or other content of communications within a user&rsquo;s account.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>International Legal Requirements.</strong>
In the case of requests from law enforcement outside of the U.S., a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request or letter rogatory may be required to compel the disclosure of the contents of an account.</li>
<li><strong>Account Preservation Requests.</strong>
We will take reasonable steps to preserve account records in connection with official criminal investigations for a period of 90 days pending our receipt of a formal legal request for user data.  You may request the preservation of records via email, fax or mail as indicated below.</li>
<li><strong>Information Required in Connection With Your Request.</strong>

<ol start="4">
<li>Your Contact Information.

<ol>
<li>Requesting Agency&rsquo;s name</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s name</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s badge/identification number</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s Agency-issued Email address</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s telephone number, including extension</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s mailing address (PO Box not acceptable)</li>
<li>Requested response date (please allow at least 3 weeks for processing)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Data Request Information

<ol start="8">
<li>Full (first and last) name of the Asana User</li>
<li>Email address(es) associated with the User&rsquo;s account</li>
<li>A clear and specific description of the data being requested (we will be unable to process overly broad or vague requests)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Data Availability.</strong>
We will search for and disclose data that is specified with particularity in an appropriate form of legal process and which we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.</li>
<li><strong>User Notification.</strong>
Asana&rsquo;s policy is to notify users of requests for their information, which includes a copy of the request, prior to disclosure so that they may have an opportunity to challenge such request unless: (a) we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order; (b) there are exceptional circumstances, such as an emergency involving the risk of bodily injury or death to a person or group of people or potential harm to minors; or (c) prior notice would be counterproductive (for example, if we believe that the account in question has been hijacked).
Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain a proper court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.  Please note that Officer authored affidavits, cover letters or similar statements are not sufficient to preclude notice to our users.
Please note that in situations where a data request draws attention to an ongoing violation of our Terms of Service we may, in order to protect our service and its Users, take action to prevent any further abuse, including actions that could notify the User(s) who are the subject of your data request that we are aware of their misconduct.</li>
<li><strong>Submitting Your Request.</strong>
A data request may be served by fax to (415) 484-7702, by certified mail, express courier, or in person at our corporate headquarters at the following address:
<strong>Asana, Inc., 1550 Bryant Street, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103</strong></li>

                    <h3>Amendment to Asana Subscriber Agreement</h3>

<h4>Applicable to U.S. Government Customers</h4>

<p class="-label">Last Updated: May 29, 2015</p>

<p>This is a supplemental agreement (&#8220;Amendment&#8221;) between Asana and U.S. Government customers (the &ldquo;Customer&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;) and applies to the Agency&rsquo;s use of Asana&rsquo;s collaborative workplace management service (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) under Asana&rsquo;s Premium Subscriber Agreement (the &ldquo;Subscriber Agreement&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The reason for this Amendment is that the Customer, a U.S. Government instrumentality, is obligated to follow federal laws, regulations, and practices, among which are those relating to ethics, advertising and endorsements, tax exemption and immunity, limitations on indemnification, fiscal law constraints, governing law and jurisdiction, dispute resolution, and assignment of contracts.</p>

<p>Asana and Agency (the &#8220;Parties&#8221;) agree that modifications to the Subscriber Agreement available at <a href="#subscriber-agreement">#subscriber-agreement</a> are appropriate to accommodate the Agency&rsquo;s legal status, its public mission, and other special circumstances.  Therefore, the Subscriber Agreement is modified by this Amendment as follows.</p>

<p>A. <strong><em>Government entity</em></strong>: As it relates to the Agency&rsquo;s usage of the Service, the word &#8220;Customer&#8221; in the Subscriber Agreement shall mean the Agency itself and shall not apply to, nor bind (i) the individual(s) who utilize the Asana Service on the Agency&#8217;s behalf, or (ii) any individual users who happen to be employed by, or otherwise associated with, the Agency. Asana will look solely to the Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Subscriber Agreement by such individuals, subject to federal law.</p>

<p>B. <strong><em>Advertisements</em></strong>: Asana agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Asana site that display content uploaded by or under the control of the Agency.</p>

<p>C. <strong><em>Taxes</em></strong>: With reference to Section 5 of the Subscriber Agreement, the Parties understand that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 29.302 (48 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 29, Subpart 29.302 – Application of State and local taxes to the Government) states that &#8220;Generally, purchases and leases made by the Federal Government are immune from State and local taxation.&#8221; Therefore, Asana will include no tax in Agency billings unless the tax has been determined by the Agency to be proper for payment.</p>

<p>D. <strong><em>Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations</em></strong>: Any provisions in the Subscriber Agreement related to indemnification by the customer, damages, attorneys fees, filing deadlines, defense of lawsuits, collection expenses, and settlement are hereby waived. Liability of either party for any breach of the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Subscriber Agreement or this Amendment, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Contract Disputes Act, or other governing federal authority. Federal Statute of Limitations provisions shall apply to any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Subscriber Agreement or this Amendment.</p>

<p>E. <strong><em>Governing law and Forum</em></strong>: The Subscriber Agreement and this Amendment shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance with, applicable federal laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California including its choice of law rules will apply in the absence of applicable federal law. Any arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution provision in the Subscriber Agreement is hereby waived. The forum for purposes of resolving claims and disputes will be determined in accordance with federal law.</p>

<p>F. <strong><em>No automatic renewal</em></strong>: With respect to Section 5 of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees to waive the provision allowing Asana to automatically charge the Agency upon a renewal date associated with Customer&rsquo;s account. Asana agrees to remove the auto-renew default setting for any Agency whose account details page designates an email address that ends in .gov, .mil, or .fed.us.  Instead, Asana will notify the Agency to allow the Agency to determine if funds are available and if the Service will be needed for a renewal period.</p>

<p>G.  <strong><em>Continuity of service during dispute</em></strong>: With respect to Section 6 of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees to waive the language that would otherwise permit Asana to terminate the Premium Subscription contract in the event of an alleged breach of the Agreement by the Agency. Instead, recourse against the United States for any alleged breach of the Agreement must be made under the terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act or as a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act, as applicable. During the resolution of the dispute the Contractor, Asana, shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Agency Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>H. <strong><em>Limitation of liability</em></strong>: The Parties agree that nothing in the limitation of liability provision in Section 10 or elsewhere in the Subscriber Agreement in any way grants Asana a waiver from, release of, or limitation of, liability pertaining to any past, current or future violation of federal law.</p>

<p>I. <strong><em>No endorsement</em></strong>: With reference to Section 4(d) of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees that the Agency&rsquo;s name, seals, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and the fact that the Agency has a presence on the Asana site and uses its Services, shall not be used by Asana in such a manner as to state or imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that Asana&#8217;s products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by the Agency or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by the Agency or the Federal Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, Asana agrees not to display any Agency or Government names, seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on Asana&#8217;s homepage or elsewhere on the Asana Site unless permission to do so has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant federal government authority.  Asana may list the Agency&#8217;s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party customer.</p>

<p>J. <strong><em>Assignment</em></strong>: As indicated in Section 11(e) of the Subscriber Agreement, neither party may assign its obligations under the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment to any third party without prior written consent of the other. However, if Agency is using Asana&rsquo;s free services only, Asana or its subsidiaries may, without the Agency&rsquo;s consent, assign the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any transfer of Asana assets related to the Agency&rsquo;s paid subscription contract requires review and consent by the Agency, under the procedures found in the FAR Subpart 42.13 (48 CFR Chapter 1, Part 42, Subpart 42.12 - Novation).</p>

<p>K. <strong><em>Precedence; Further Amendments</em></strong>: If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Subscriber Agreement, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules or policies on the Asana site or related to its Service, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment constitutes a mutually agreed upon amendment to the Subscriber Agreement; language in the Subscriber Agreement in Section 11(e) indicating it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. Any further amendment must be agreed to in writing by both Parties.</p>

<p>L. <strong><em>Posting of Amendment</em></strong>: This Amendment shall be posted with the Asana&rsquo;s online Subscriber Agreement either by incorporation of its text or via an integral link.</p>

                    <h3>Asana Subprocessors</h3>

<p class="-label">Last Updated: June 7, 2018</p>

<p>In connection with our provision of the Services, Asana and its affiliates may engage third parties (each a “Subprocessor”) to process your Personal Data.  In certain circumstances an affiliate of Asana may even be a Subprocessor. As a condition of permitting a Subprocessor to process your Personal Data, Asana (and its affiliates as applicable) will enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor containing data protection obligations at least as protective as the technical and organizational measures Asana has put into place to protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. All terms capitalized above, but not defined have the meaning set forth in Asana’s <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a>, <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, and/or your applicable customer agreement with Asana.</p>

                    <h3>Asana’s Commitment to GDPR Compliance</h3>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a European law establishing protections for the personal data of EU residents that came into force on May 25, 2018. Under the GDPR, organizations that collect, maintain, use, or otherwise process EU residents’ personal data (regardless of the organization’s location) must implement certain privacy and security safeguards for that data. Asana has established a comprehensive GDPR compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on GDPR compliance efforts. 
Some significant steps Asana has taken to align its practices with the GDPR include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revisions to our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users</li>
<li>Enhancements to our security practices and procedures</li>
<li>Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share</li>
<li>Creating more robust internal privacy and security documentation</li>
<li>Training employees on GDPR requirements and privacy/security best practices generally</li>
<li>Carefully evaluating and building a data subject rights’ policy and response process
Below, we provide additional details about the core areas of Asana’s GDPR compliance program and how customers can use Asana to support their own GDPR compliance initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Processing Agreements</h4>

<p>Under the GDPR, “data controllers” (i.e. entities that determine the purposes and means of processing data) are required to enter into agreements with other entities that process data on their behalf (called “data processors”). Asana offers its customers who are controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into a robust data processing agreement under which Asana commits to process and safeguard personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements. This includes Asana’s commitment to process personal data consistent with the instructions of the data controller.</p>

<h4>International Data Transfers</h4>

<p>As with prior EU data protection laws, the GDPR requires organizations to use a recognized legal mechanism to transfer data from the EU to other countries that do not have a similar data protection framework, including the United States. To comply with this requirement, Asana is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, which requires it to maintain certain safeguards for personal data transferred to the United States. Additionally, Asana offers customers who are data controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into EU Model Contractual Clauses with us upon request.</p>

<h4>Data Access, Management, and Portability Tools</h4>

<p>The GDPR gives individual data subjects in certain circumstances the rights to, among other things, access, delete, and make corrections to their data. Asana is committed to facilitating data subject requests consistent with the GDPR, as further described in our <a href="/terms#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Privacy Documentation</h4>

<p>At its core, the GDPR is focused on transparency, fairness, and accountability. Accordingly, the law requires organizations to maintain documentation about their privacy practices and their decisions about how they handle individuals’ personal data. Asana shares the GDPR’s commitment to these principles, and has included within its ongoing GDPR compliance program documentation about its data collection and processing activities, and the various policies and guidelines it follows pursuant to the GDPR. You can learn more about how Asana collects, uses, and discloses personal data by visiting Asana’s <a href="/terms#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Data Security</h4>

<p>The GDPR requires organizations to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data. Security continues to be a priority for Asana: we are now SOC 2 Type 1 certified (read more about our certification <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2018/09/asana-soc-2-type-1-audit/">here</a>) and have implemented a variety of safeguards to protect the security of our platform, including encrypting web connections to protect data transmissions, replicating our databases to support reliability of the platform, and controlling access to our facilities and office network. Asana also offers customers the ability to use additional security controls to further enhance the security of their teams’ data. For more information, please see our <a href="/security-statement">Security Statement</a>.</p>

<h4>Ongoing Compliance and Communication</h4>

<p>The GDPR’s requirements are comprehensive, but the law and regulatory guidance will evolve.  As data protection authorities in Europe interpret the GDPR’s requirements and issue guidance, we will continue to follow these developments closely and evaluate our program for any changes or enhancements as needed.
We value communication with our customers. If you have any questions about our GDPR compliance efforts, or if you are a data controller customer with questions about how we can help support your own GDPR compliance efforts, please contact us at privacy@asana.com.</p>

                    <h3>Asana User Terms of Service</h3>

<p class="-label">Effective Date: November 1, 2018</p>

<p>Asana, Inc. (“Asana,” “we,” “our”) offers a variety of team productivity, collaboration, and organizational tools available online, including via a mobile application (collectively, the “Service”), and websites, including but not limited to www.asana.com, wavelength.com, blog.asana.com, community.asana.com (the “<strong>Websites</strong>”).
Asana, Inc. is located at 1550 Bryant Street, Suite 200, San Francisco, CA 94103.  If you have any questions about these User Terms of Service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”), please email us at <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#58;&#x74;&#x65;&#114;&#109;&#x73;&#x2d;&#113;&#117;&#x65;&#x73;&#116;&#105;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#115;&#64;&#x61;&#x73;&#97;&#110;&#x61;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">terms-questions@asana.com</a>.
Asana has three different types of users depending on the Asana products used:</p>

<ul>
<li>We call users of the Websites “<strong>Site Visitors</strong>.”</li>
<li>We call users who use the free version of the Asana Service “<strong>Free Users</strong>.”  While Free Users can access and use the Service, they have access to a more limited set of Service features and functionality than Subscribers.</li>
<li>We call users who use the Service as part of a paid Asana subscription plan (regardless of the subscription tier) “<strong>Subscribers</strong>.”  The Service features and functionalities available to Subscribers are determined by the subscription tier and the specific terms agreed to between Asana and the organization (e.g., your employer or another entity or person, called the “<strong>Customer</strong>”) that entered into a separate agreement that governs delivery, access, and use of the Service (the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>”).</li>
</ul>

<p>We refer to these three types of users collectively as “<strong>Users</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>” for purposes of these Terms.  Regardless of what type of User you are, these Terms create a legal agreement directly between you and Asana and explain the rules governing use of the Service and Websites.  By accessing or using the Service and Websites, you acknowledge and agree that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Service and Websites.
We may, from time to time, modify these Terms. Please check this page periodically for updates. We will comply with applicable local legal obligations to provide you with notice of changes to these Terms. Your continued use of the Service and Websites after any such update constitutes your acceptance of such changes.</p>

<h4>1. ELIGIBILITY AND SCOPE</h4>

<h4>II. Privacy Terms for Subscribers<a id="privacy-subscribers"></a></h4>

<p><strong>A.    Overview</strong></p>

<p>Section II of this Policy applies only to <strong>Subscribers</strong>.
If you are a Subscriber, the “<strong>Customer Agreement</strong>” governs the collection and processing of information collected from you through the Customer’s instance of the Service (e.g. a Customer&#8217;s organization or workspace, but for purposes of this Policy referred to as the “<strong>Workspace</strong>”), including all associated messages, attachments, files, tasks, projects and project names, team names, channels, conversations, and other content submitted through the Service (“<strong>Workspace Content</strong>”).   In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Customer Agreement, the Customer Agreement governs.
Because the Customer controls the Workspace used by Subscribers, if you have any questions about the Customer’s specific Workspace settings and privacy practices, please contact the Customer whose Workspace you use.
If you are a Subscriber located in the European Union, please note that the Customer is the data controller with respect to the processing of your Workspace Content pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).  When processing Workspace Content of EU data subjects governed by the Customer Agreement, Asana is the data processor, meaning that we collect and process such information solely on behalf of the Customer.</p>

<p><strong>B.    Collection and Use of Subscriber Information</strong></p>

<p>This section explains the information we collect from Subscribers.  We do not require Subscribers to provide us with information.  However, certain information, such as account log-in data, is required to provide you with access to the Service, and other information may be collected automatically as you use the Service.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Workspace Content</strong>. Workspace Content is collected, used, and shared by Asana in accordance with the Customer’s instructions, including any applicable terms in the Customer Agreement, or as required by applicable law.  The Customer, and not Asana, determines its own, internal policies regarding storage, access, modification, deletion, sharing, and retention of Workspace Content which may apply to your use of the Service. For example, a Customer may provide or remove access to the Service, enable or disable third party integrations, manage permissions, retention and export settings, transfer or assign teams, or share projects. Please check with the Customer about the policies and settings that they have instituted with respect the Workspace Content that you provide when using the Service.</li>
<li><strong>Account Information</strong>.  To set up your Asana account, you or the Customer will provide us with basic information about you which may include your name, address, telephone number, email address, and password.  You will then have the ability to provide optional profile information, such as a photograph or basic demographic data.  With your permission, we may also upload calendar information stored on your mobile device to your account.  If you submit payment information in connection with your use of the Service, we utilize a third party credit card payment processing company to collect payment information, including your credit card number, billing address, and phone number.  In such circumstances, the third party service provider, and not Asana, stores your payment information on our behalf.</li>
<li><strong>Service Usage Information</strong>.  As you use the Service, we collect information about how you use and interact with the Service (“Service Usage Information”).  Such information includes:

<ul>

We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</li>
<li>Log files – when you use the Service, our servers automatically record information in server log files.

<li>Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</li>
<li>Workspace Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Workspace.  For example, we may log the number of Workspaces you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; the types of files you share; and what, if any, third party services and integrations you use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Other Information</strong>. You may provide us with information when you interact with us in other ways, such as when you submit requests or questions to us via forms or email (e.g., support forms, sales forms, user research participation forms); information you provide in connection with Asana sweepstakes, contests, or research studies in which you choose to participate; beta testing; and requests for customer support and technical assistance (collectively, “Other Information”).</li>
<li><strong>Information Collected from Third-Party Integrations</strong>.  If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g., OneDrive, Unito, Wufoo, Slack) through the Service, or if you are required or permitted to do so by a Customer, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service.  If you initiate these connections, you also understand that we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections.  By enabling these connections, you authorize us to connect and access the information provided through these connections, and you understand that the privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>Device information – when you access the Service using a mobile device, we collect certain device information, including the type of device you are using, its operating system, and mobile network information, which may include your mobile phone number. We may also collect your MAC address and other unique device identifiers.</li>

<li>Location information – we collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</li>
<li>Workspace Use Metadata – when you interact with the Service, metadata is generated that provides high-level (non-content) information about the way you work in your Workspace.  For example, we may log the number of Workspaces you work in; the number of tasks to which you are assigned; the features and embedded Service content you interact with; the types of files you share; and what, if any, third party services and integrations you use.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Information Collected from Third Party Integrations</strong>. If you choose to use or connect to third-party integrations (e.g., OneDrive, Unito, Wufoo, Slack) through the Service, such third parties may allow us to have access to and store additional information about your interaction with those services as it relates to your use of the Service.  Moreover, if you initiate these connections, you also understand that we will share information about you that is required to enable your use of the third-party integration through the Service. If you do not wish to have this information shared, do not initiate these connections.  By enabling these connections, you authorize us to connect and access the information provided through these connections, and you understand that the privacy policies of these third parties govern such connections.</li>

<h4>IV. Privacy Terms for Site Visitors<a id="privacy-visitors"></a></h4>

<p><strong>A.    Overview</strong></p>

<p>Section IV of this Policy applies only to Site Visitors.
If you visit the Websites, regardless of whether you are also a user of the Service, the following rules apply to you.  To eliminate any confusion, please note that the terms in this section apply only to use of Asana’s Websites, not to use of the Service.
If you are a Site Visitor located in the European Union, Asana is the data controller with respect to the processing of your personal data pursuant to the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“<strong>GDPR</strong>”).</p>

<p><strong>B.    Collection and Use of Site Visitor Information</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Information Collected from Site Visitors</p>

<p>When you use the Websites, we collect the following information about you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact Information – if you submit a request for information or a question through the Websites, you may be asked to provide us with basic information including your name, email address, phone number, and postal address.  We will also keep records of the communication, the question/request you raised, and how it was resolved.  If you choose to participate in an Asana sweepstakes, contest, or research study offered through the Websites, we will also collect basic contact information from you in connection with such activity.</li>
<li>Websites Usage Information – as you browse the Websites, we and our service providers (which are third party companies that work on our behalf to provide and enhance the Websites) use a variety of technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting information about how you use the Websites.  For example, our servers automatically record certain information in server logs. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type and settings, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Websites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, mobile carrier, mobile device identifiers and information about the device you are using to access the Websites, date and time stamp information and other such information.</li>
<li>Location Information – We collect and process general information about the location of the device from which you are accessing the Service (e.g., approximate geographic location inferred from an IP address).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Cookies and Similar Technologies</p>

<p>To collect the Websites Usage Information discussed above, we and our service providers use Internet server logs, cookies, tags, SDKs, tracking pixels, and other similar tracking technologies. A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. An SDK is a section of code that we embed in our applications and software to allow third parties to collect information about how users interact with the Websites. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site, that enables us to: (i) recognize your computer and login session; (ii) store your preferences and settings; (iii) understand which pages of the Websites you have visited; (iv), enhance your user experience by delivering and measuring the effectiveness of content and advertising tailored to your interests; (v) perform analytics; and (vi) assist with security and administrative functions. Tracking pixels (sometimes referred to as web beacons or clear GIFs) are tiny electronic tags with a unique identifier embedded in websites, online ads and/or email, and that are designed to provide usage information like ad impressions or clicks, email open rates, measure popularity of the Websites and associated advertising, and to access user cookies. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather information through other methods.
Please note that you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether. Please consult the “Help” section of your browser for more information (e.g., Internet Explorer; Google Chrome; Mozilla Firefox; or Apple Safari).</p></li>
<li><p>Use of Information Collected from Site Visitors</p>

<p>We use the information collected from Site Visitors for a variety of purposes including to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maintain, provide, and improve the Websites and the Service</li>
<li>Respond to your requests for information</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable legal obligations, communicate with you about promotions, offers, and news about Asana.  You have the ability to unsubscribe from such promotional communications</li>
<li>Prevent or address technical or security issues</li>
<li>Investigate in good faith alleged violations of our <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a></li>
<li>Help us better understand Site Visitor interests and needs, and customize the advertising and content you see on the Websites</li>
<li>Engage in analysis and research regarding use of the Websites and the Service</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>C.    Legal Bases</strong></p>

<p>If you are located in the EU, please note that the legal bases under the GDPR for using the information we collect through your use of the Websites as a Site Visitor are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary to perform our obligations under a contract with you (for example, to comply with the <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a> which you accept by browsing the Websites)</li>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others (for example, to provide security for our Websites; operate our Websites; prevent fraud, analyze use of and improve our Websites, and for similar purposes)</li>
<li>Where use of your information is necessary to comply with a legal obligation</li>
<li>Where we have your consent to process data in a certain way</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>D.    Aggregate/De-Identified Data</strong></p>

<p>We may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected through the Websites so that such information can no longer be linked to you or your device (“Aggregate/De-Identified Information”). We may use Aggregate/De-Identified Information for any purpose, including without limitation for research and marketing purposes, and may also share such data with any third parties, including advertisers, promotional partners, sponsors, event promoters, and/or others.</p>

<p><strong>E.    Combined Information</strong></p>

<p>You agree that, for the purposes discussed in this Policy, we may combine the information that we collect through the Websites with information that we receive from other sources, both online and offline, and use such combined information in accordance with this Policy.  If, however, the collection of any information about you is governed by a Customer Agreement, information will only be combined and used in accordance with such Customer Agreement and the sections of this Policy applicable to Subscribers.</p>

<p><strong>F.    Website Analytics and Advertising</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Website Analytics</p>

<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Websites to collect and analyze usage information through cookies and similar tools; engage in auditing, research, or reporting; and provide certain features to you. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Online Advertising</p>

<p>The Websites may integrate third-party advertising technologies that allow for the delivery of relevant content and advertising on the Websites, as well as on other websites you visit. The ads may be based on various factors such as the content of the page you are visiting, information you enter such as your age and gender, your searches, demographic data, and other information we collect from you. These ads may be based on your current activity or your activity over time and across other websites and online services and may be tailored to your interests.</p>

<p>Third parties, whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Websites, may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about you as discussed above. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on our Websites and other websites and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Websites. We sometimes provide Site Visitor information (such as email addresses) to service providers, who may “match” this information in de-identified form to cookies (or mobile ad identifiers) and other proprietary IDs, in order to provide you with more relevant ads when you visit other websites.</p>

<p>We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your device you use to access the Websites by such non-affiliated third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, the <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link</a>, or <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">Your Online Choices</a> to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, visit the <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated">Google Ads Settings</a> page. We do not control these opt-out links or whether any particular company chooses to participate in these opt-out programs. We are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>

<p>Please note that if you exercise the opt-out choices above, you will still see advertising when you use the Websites, but it will not be tailored to you based on your online behavior over time.</p></li>
<li>Notice Concerning Do Not Track
Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Websites for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the variety of opt-out mechanisms listed above. However, we do not currently recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals. To learn more about Do Not Track, you can do so <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">here</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>G.    Sharing of Site Visitor Information</strong></p>

<p>We share the information we collect through the Websites with the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Affiliates and Subsidiaries. We may share the information we collect within the Asana family of companies.</li>
<li>Service Providers. We may provide access to or share your information with select third parties that use the information only to perform services on our behalf. These third parties provide a variety of services to us, including without limitation sales, marketing, provision of content and features, advertising, analytics, research, data storage, security, fraud prevention, and other services.</li>
<li>Business Transfers. If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner so that the Websites can continue to operate. In such case, your information would remain subject to the promises and commitments contained in this Policy until such time as this Policy is updated or amended by the acquiring party upon notice to you. If such transfer is subject to additional mandatory restrictions under applicable laws, Asana will comply with such restrictions.</li>
<li>Public Forums. The Websites makes it possible for you to upload and share comments or feedback publicly with other users, such as on the Asana community forum. Any information that you submit through such public features is not confidential, and Asana may use it for any purpose (including in testimonials or other Asana marketing materials). Any information you post openly in these ways will be available to the public at large and potentially accessible through third-party search engines. Such information can be read, collected and/or used by other users, and it could be used to send you unsolicited messages. Accordingly, please take care when using these features of the Websites.</li>
<li>Consent. We may also disclose your information to third parties with your consent to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>H.    Retention of Your Information</strong></p>

<p>We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.</p>

<p><strong>I.    Data Subject Rights</strong></p>

<p>Local legal requirements (such as those in the EU) may afford you additional rights. If you would like further information in relation to your legal rights under applicable law or would like to exercise any of them, please contact us using the information in the “Asana Contact Info” section below at any time.

<p>We will consider all requests and provide our response within the time period stated by applicable law. Please note, however, that certain information may be exempt from such requests in some circumstances, which may include if we need to keep processing your information for our legitimate interests or to comply with a legal obligation. We may request you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity before responding to your request.</p>

<p><strong>J.    Third Party Links And Services</strong></p>

<p>The Websites may contain links to third-party websites and functionalities. If you choose to use these third party services, you may disclose your information not just to those third-parties, but also to their users and the public more generally depending on how their services function. Because these third-party websites and services are not operated by Asana, Asana is not responsible for the content or practices of those websites or services. The collection, use, and disclosure of your information will be subject to the privacy policies of the third party websites or services, and not this Policy. We urge you to read the privacy and security policies of these third-parties.</p>

<h4>V.  Additional Privacy Terms for All Users<a id="privacy-all"></a></h4>

<p>The following additional information about Asana’s privacy practices apply to all users of Asana (Subscribers, Free Users, and Site Visitors).</p>

<p><strong>A.    International Users</strong></p>

<p>Asana complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Asana has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability. If there is any conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification page, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov/. In compliance with the EU-US Privacy Shield and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, Asana commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal data. European Union or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact Asana at: privacy@asana.com. Asana has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Privacy Shield, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by Asana, please visit the BBB EU Privacy Shield web site at https://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint. Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel. Asana is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) with respect to its compliance with the provisions of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield.</p>

<p>We may transfer information that we collect about you to third party processors across borders and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring information to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction. Asana will take reasonable and appropriate steps necessary to ensure that any third party who is acting as a “data processor” under EU and Swiss terminology is processing the personal data we entrust to them in a manner that is consistent with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. Asana is potentially liable in cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU and Swiss individuals received pursuant to the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>B.    Changes To Our Privacy Policy</strong></p>

<p>We reserve the right to amend this Policy at any time to reflect changes in the law, our data collection and use practices, the features of our Service or Websites, or advances in technology. We will make the revised Policy accessible through the Service and Websites, so you should review the Policy periodically. If we make a material change to the Policy, we will comply with applicable legal requirements regarding providing you with notice and/or consent.</p>

<p><strong>C.    How We Protect Your Information</strong></p>

<p>Asana takes technical and organizational measures to protect your information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, and no means of electronic or physical storage, is absolutely secure, and thus we cannot ensure or warrant the security of that information.</p>

<p><strong>D.    Marketing Practices and Choices</strong></p>

<p>If you receive email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.  You may instruct us not to use your contact information to contact you by email, postal mail, or phone regarding products, services, promotions and special events that might appeal to your interests by contacting us at the “Asana Contact Info” section below. In commercial email messages, you can also opt out by following the instructions located at the bottom of such emails. Please note that, regardless of your request, we may still use and share certain information as permitted by this Policy or as required by applicable law. For example, you may not opt out of certain operational or service-related emails, such as those reflecting our relationship or transactions with you.</p>

<p><strong>E.    California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

<p>California law gives residents of California the right under certain circumstances to request information from us regarding the manner in which we share certain categories of personal information (as defined by applicable California law) with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. However, Asana does not share your personal information with third parties for their own direct marketing purposes.</p>

Payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable unless otherwise provided herein. The number of End Users purchased under a Subscription cannot be decreased during the applicable Subscription Term. If Customer requires the use of a purchase order or purchase order number, Customer shall provide the purchase order number at the time of purchase. Where Customer designates use of a third-party payment processor network (such as a payment agent, for example), Customer shall be responsible for payment of all fees and charges associated with use of such network. Asana reserves the right to suspend Customer’s account, in addition to all of its other available rights and remedies, in the event that Customer’s account becomes overdue. Suspension shall not relieve Customer’s obligation to pay amounts due.</p>

<p><strong>3.2   Auto-renewal.</strong> Customer agrees that its Subscription will automatically renew on an annual or monthly basis depending on Customer’s Subscription (the “Renewal Date”). Customer authorizes Asana to automatically charge Customer for the applicable fees on or after the Renewal Date unless the Subscription has been terminated or cancelled in accordance with this Agreement. If Customer wishes to reduce the number of End Users in its Subscription, it must do so prior to the Renewal Date. Customer must cancel its Subscription prior to the Renewal Date in order to avoid billing of the next period’s Subscription fees. Customer can cancel its Subscription anytime online by going into its account settings and following the instructions provided. If Customer chooses to cancel its Subscription during the Subscription Term, Customer may use the Service until the end of Customer’s then-current Subscription Term, but will not be issued a refund for the most recently (or any previously) charged fees.</p>

<p><strong>3.3   Calculation.</strong> Subscription fees are based on annual or monthly periods (or pro rata portions thereof, calculated on a daily basis) that begin on the Subscription start date and each annual or monthly anniversary thereof. Subscriptions to the Service are sold on a tiered basis based on the number of End Users. Customer shall purchase a Subscription to the Service for each End User, and the initial number of End Users and tier is reflected in the applicable Order Form. Customer may add End Users to its Subscription at any time on written notice to Asana (email notice acceptable). Asana reserves the right to calculate the total number of End Users periodically and, if the number of End Users exceeds Customer’s current Subscription, then Asana reserves the right to invoice Customer for the applicable tier on a pro rata basis for the remaining period in Customer’s Subscription Term, so that all End User Subscription Terms coincide and are co-terminus. Asana reserves the right to revise fee rates and/or the billable amount structure for the Service at any time and will provide Customer with notice pursuant to Section 11.4 below) of any such changes at least twenty (20) days prior. Asana may charge Customer the then-current pricing for the applicable Subscription if the number of End Users is modified and/or if Customer changes its Subscription plan.</p>

<p><strong>3.4   Taxes.</strong> Any fees charged to Customer are exclusive of taxes. Except for those taxes based on Asana’s net income, Customer shall be responsible for all applicable taxes in connection with this Agreement including, but not limited to, sales, use, excise, value-added, goods and services, consumption, and other similar taxes or duties. Should any payment for the Service be subject to withholding tax by any government, Customer shall reimburse Asana for such withholding tax.</p>

<p><strong>3.5   Future Features and Functionality.</strong> Customer agrees that any purchases under this Agreement are not contingent on the delivery of any future feature or functionality or dependent on any oral or written public or private comments made by Asana regarding future features or functionality. Asana may release Improvements and other features and functionality in its discretion. Some features and functionality may be available only with certain versions of the Service.</p>

<p><strong>4 Term and Termination.</strong> This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and shall remain in effect until all Subscriptions to the Service granted in accordance with this Agreement have expired or been terminated. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party: (a) is in material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within twenty (20) days following receipt of written notice from the non-breaching party, except that termination will take effect on notice in the event of a breach of Section 1.3 (“Usage Restrictions”); or (b) ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and the proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, all Subscriptions and any other rights granted to Customer under this Agreement shall immediately terminate, and Asana may immediately deactivate Customer’s account(s) associated with the Agreement.

<p><strong>5.1   Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> During the course of performance under this Agreement, each party may make available to the other party information that is not generally known to the public and at the time of disclosure is either identified as, or should reasonably be understood by the receiving party to be, proprietary or confidential (the “Confidential Information”). Confidential Information specifically includes, but is not limited to, the Service, any Order Form(s) entered into by the parties, Customer Data, Results, business plans, product plans and roadmaps, strategies, forecasts, projects and analyses, financial information and fee structures, business processes, methods and models, and technical documentation.

<p><strong>5.2   Protection of Confidential Information.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Agreement, with the express prior written consent of the disclosing party, or as required by law, the receiving party will not disclose, transmit, or otherwise disseminate to a third party any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.  The receiving party will use the same care and discretion with respect to the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party as it uses with its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. The receiving party may disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information to its employees, Affiliates, consultants, subcontractors, agents, or advisors (“Representatives”) who have a strict need to access the Confidential Information for the purpose of performing under this Agreement and only to those who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information upon terms at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. Either party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to potential parties to a bona fide fundraising, acquisition, or similar transaction solely for purposes of the proposed transaction, provided that any such potential party is subject to written non-disclosure obligations and limitations on use no less protective than those set forth herein.</p>

<p><strong>5.3   Equitable Relief.</strong> The receiving party acknowledges that the remedy at law for breach of this Section 5 may be inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedy the disclosing party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions (without the requirement of posting a bond, other security or any similar requirement or proving any actual damages), to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Section 5 by the receiving party or any of its Representatives and to enforce the terms and provisions of this Section 5 in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing party is entitled at law or in equity.</p>

<p><strong>5.4   Compelled Disclosure.</strong> The receiving party may access and disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party if legally required to do so in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding; provided, however, that in such event the receiving party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, notify the disclosing party within a reasonable time prior to such access or disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party an opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures. If the receiving party is compelled by law to access or disclose the disclosing party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the disclosing party is a party, the disclosing party will reimburse the receiving party for the reasonable costs of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information. Receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, and any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure.</p>

<p><strong>5.5   Sensitive/Personal Information.</strong> Customer agrees that it shall not use the Service to send or store personal information subject to special regulatory or contractual handling requirements (e.g., Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, and any similar data protection laws) including without limitation: credit card information, credit card numbers and magnetic stripe information, social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, passport numbers, government issued identification numbers, health-related information, biometric data, financial account information, personally identifiable information collected from children under the age of 13 or from online services directed toward children, and real time geo-location data which can identify an individual, or information deemed “sensitive” under applicable law (such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, or religious or philosophical beliefs).</p>

<p><strong>6.2   By Asana.</strong> Asana owns and will continue to own all right, title, and interest, including all related Intellectual Property Rights, in and to its Confidential Information, Results, and the Service, including any enhancements, customizations, or modifications thereto.

<p><strong>7.1   By Customer.</strong> Customer shall defend Asana, its Affiliates, and their employees, officers, and directors (together, the “Asana Indemnified Parties”) from and against third party claims, actions, and demands arising from allegations that Customer Data, unauthorized use of the Service by Customer or its End Users, or Asana’s processing of data pursuant to Customer’s instructions infringes a third party’s Intellectual Property Right or privacy right (each, a “Claim Against Asana”), and Customer shall indemnify and hold the Asana Indemnified Parties harmless against any damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs finally awarded against Asana Indemnified Parties as a result of, or for any amounts paid by the Asana Indemnified Parties under a Customer-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Asana.</p>

<p><strong>7.2   By Asana.</strong>  Asana shall defend Customer, its Affiliates, and their employees, officers, and directors (together the “Customer Indemnified Parties”) from and against third party claims, actions, and demands alleging that Customer’s authorized use of the Service infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of that third party (each, a “Claim Against Customer”), and Asana shall indemnify and hold the Customer Indemnified Parties harmless against any damages, reasonable attorneys’ fees, and costs finally awarded against Customer Indemnified Parties as a result of, or for any amounts paid by the Customer Indemnified Parties under an Asana-approved settlement of, a Claim Against Customer; provided, however, in no event will Asana have any obligations or liability under this Section 7.2 to the extent a Claim Against Customer arises from: (a) Customer or any End User’s use of the Service other than as permitted under this Agreement; or (b) use of the Service in a modified form or in combination with products, services, content, or data not furnished to Customer by Asana.</p>

<p><strong>7.3   Potential Infringement.</strong>  If the Service becomes, or in Asana’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Asana may in its sole discretion: (a) obtain the right, at Asana’s expense, for Customer to continue using the Service; (b) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; or (c) modify the Service so that it is no longer infringing. If Asana, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Asana may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service, in which case Asana’s sole liability (in addition to its obligations under Section 7.2) shall be to provide Customer with a prorated refund of any prepaid, unused fees applicable to the remaining portion of the Subscription Term. Sections 7.2 and 7.3 state Asana’s sole liability and the Customer Indemnified Parties’ exclusive remedy for infringement claims.</p>

<p><strong>7.4   Indemnification Process.</strong> The party seeking indemnification shall provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and shall promptly provide the indemnifying party with all information and assistance reasonably requested and otherwise cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. Failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations under this Agreement only to the extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The indemnifying party shall have full control and authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment shall require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p>

<p><strong>9 Export Compliance.</strong> The Service may be subject to export laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions. Customer represents that neither it nor any of its End Users are named on any U.S. government denied-party list. Customer shall not permit any End User to access or use any Service in a U.S.-embargoed country or region or in violation of any U.S. export law or regulation.

<h4>11  Miscellaneous.</h4>

<p><strong>11.1  Prior Versions.</strong> If you were an existing Customer prior to November 30, 2018, the prior version of this Agreement you agreed to when subscribing to the Service will continue to apply to you until you are otherwise notified in accordance with the terms of that agreement.</p>

<p><strong>11.2  Governing Law; Venue.</strong> This Agreement and any disputes arising under it will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of laws provisions, and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction and venue of the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California.

<p><strong>11.3  Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.</strong>  The parties agree that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation. The parties agree to use their best efforts to settle any dispute directly through consultation with each other before initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, the parties agree that any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity or termination, shall be resolved according to California law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (JAMS) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS. If the parties cannot agree upon selection of an arbitrator, then JAMS shall appoint an arbitrator experienced in the enterprise software industry. The place of the arbitration will be San Francisco, California unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration will be conducted in English. The arbitrator shall provide detailed written findings of fact and conclusions of law in support of any award. Judgment upon any such award may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of Section 11.3 mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Customer may opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending written notice to Asana. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the Effective Date of this Agreement between Customer and Asana. If Customer opts out of arbitration, Asana also will not be bound to arbitrate. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as set forth in Section 5.3 (“Equitable Relief”) above and to stop unauthorized use of the Service or infringement of Intellectual Property Rights. Disputes, claims, or controversies concerning either party’s Intellectual Property Rights or claims of piracy or unauthorized use of the Service shall not be subject to arbitration. The parties further agree that the prevailing party in any action or proceeding to enforce any right or provisions under this Agreement, including any arbitration or court proceedings, will be entitled to recover its reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees.</p>

Customer acknowledges and understands that its participation in Beta Tests is not required and is at Customer’s own risk, and that Beta Products are made available on an “as is” basis without warranties (express or implied) of any kind, and may be discontinued or modified at any time. Beta Products are for evaluation and testing purposes, not for production use, not supported, not subject to availability or security obligations, and may be subject to additional terms.

Asana shall be relieved from its obligations (or part thereof) as long as the Force Majeure Event lasts and hinders the performance of said obligations (or part thereof). Asana shall promptly notify Customer and make reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of the Force Majeure Event.</p>

<p><strong>11.9  Severability; No Waiver.</strong> In the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to any judicial decree or decision, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and a party’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>

<p><strong>11.10 Assignment.</strong> Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights and licenses granted under this Agreement may be transferred or assigned by either party without the other party’s express written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that either party may assign this Agreement and all Order Forms under this Agreement upon written notice without the other party’s consent to an Affiliate or to its successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets not involving a direct competitor of the non-assigning party.

                    <h3>Asana Cookies Policy</h3>

<p class="-label">Effective Date: October 19, 2017</p>

<p>We use and allow certain other companies to use cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies (collectively “Cookies”) on our Services. We do this to understand your use of our Services; improve your user experience and enable personalized features and content; optimize our advertisements and marketing; and to enable third-party advertising companies to assist us in serving ads specific to your interests across the Internet. 
You can find more information about Cookies at: <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>

<h4>What are Cookies?</h4>

<p>Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to the browser that you use when you visit a site. The entity that places cookies on your browser can then read the information on that cookie that it set. Cookies are typically classified as either “session cookies” which do not stay on your device after you close your browser or “persistent cookies” which will usually remain on your device until you delete them or they expire.
Different cookies are used to perform different functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Essential Cookies</strong>: Some cookies are essential and enable you to move around the Services and use their features, such as accessing secure areas of the Services. Without these cookies, we cannot enable appropriate content based on the type of device you are using.
Functionality Cookies: These cookies allow us to remember choices you make on our websites (such as your preferred language or the region you are in). </li>
<li><strong>Personalization Cookies</strong>: We also use cookies to change the way our Services behave or look in order to personalize your experience from information we infer from your behavior on our Services or information we may already know about you because, for example, you are a registered user. These cookies may be used to tailor the Services or the content, look and feel delivered to you on subsequent sessions to our Services. For example, if you personalize webpages, or use specific parts of the Services, a cookie helps our webpage server recall your specific information. When you next use the Services, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Services features that you previously chose. </li>
<li><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong>: We use our own cookies and/or third-party cookies and other identifiers (such as web beacons) to see how you use our Services in order to enhance their performance and develop them according to the preferences of our customers and visitors. For example, cookies and web beacons may be used to: maintain a consistent look and feel across our Services; track and provide trend analysis on how our users interact with our Services; track errors and measure the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. </li>
<li><strong>Advertising Cookies</strong>: These cookies record your visit to our Services, your opening and review of our emails, the pages you have visited, and the links you have clicked. They gather information about your browsing habits and remember that you have visited a website. We or our service providers may use this information to make advertisements more relevant to you.  </li>
<li><strong>Cross-Device Cookies</strong>:  Sometimes, we may use cookies in combination with the information we collect &#8212; for instance, usernames, IP addresses and unique mobile device identifiers &#8212; to locate or try to locate the same unique users across multiple browsers or devices (such as smartphones or tablets), or work with service providers that do this, in order to save your preferences across devices and analyze usage of the Services.  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Third-Party Cookies</h4>

<p>Please note that third parties (including for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies on our Services. 
We used trusted partners like DoubleClick and Google AdWords to help us service advertising. We also use Google Analytics on our Services to help us analyze how our Services are used.  Google Analytics uses performance cookies to track visitor interactions. For example, by using cookies, Google can tell us which pages our users view, which are most popular, what time of day our websites are visited, whether visitors have been to our websites before, what website referred the visitor to our websites, and other similar information.<br>
We have little control over these “third party” cookies, so we suggest that you check the respective privacy policies for these external services to help you understand what data these organizations hold about you and what they do with it.</p>

If you are a California resident, you waive your rights under California Civil Code 1542, which states, &#8220;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.&#8221; You understand that any fact relating to any matter covered by this release may be found to be other than now believed to be true and you accept and assume the risk of such possible differences in fact. In addition, you expressly waive and relinquish any and all rights and benefits that you may have under any other state or federal statute or common law principle of similar effect, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</li>
<li><strong>Indemnification.</strong> To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless Asana and its subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, agents, licensors, co-branders or other partners, and employees from any and all third party claims arising from or in any way related to your use of the Asana APIs, including any liability or expense arising from all claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs and fees (including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees) of every kind and nature.</li>
<li><strong>Remedies.</strong> You acknowledge that your breach of this API Agreement may cause irreparable harm to Asana, the extent of which would be difficult to ascertain. Accordingly, you agree that, in addition to any other remedies to which Asana may be legally entitled, Asana shall have the right to seek immediate injunctive relief in the event of a breach of this API Agreement by you or any of your officers, employees, consultants or other agents.</li>
<li><strong>General Terms.</strong>

<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Relationship of the Parties.</strong> You and Asana shall be and act independently and not as partners, joint venturers, agents, employee or employer of the other. You shall not have any authority to assume or create any obligation for or on behalf of Asana, express or implied, and you shall not attempt to bind Asana to any contract.</li>
<li><strong>Severability.</strong> If any provision of these API Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties&rsquo; intentions as reflected in the provision and that the other provisions remain in full force and effect.</li>
<li><strong>Governing Law.</strong> These API Terms and the relationship between you and Asana shall be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Asana agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within the city and county of San Francisco, CA.</li>
<li><strong>No Waiver.</strong> Asana&rsquo;s failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these API Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li>

                    <h3>Law Enforcement Data Request Guidelines</h3>

<p>These guidelines are intended to provide law enforcement authorities with information regarding the process for requesting records from Asana.  So that we can ensure compliance with our user Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, we respond only to law enforcement requests that adhere to established legal process and applicable law.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>U.S. Legal Process Requirements.</strong>
We disclose user information solely in accordance with our published Terms of Service and applicable U.S. law, including the federal Stored Communications Act (&#8220;SCA&#8221;), 18 U.S.C. Sections 2701-2712.  In accordance with U.S. law:

<ol>
<li>A jurisdictionally valid subpoena, issued in connection with an official criminal investigation, is required to compel the disclosure of basic user records, which may include name, length of service, credit card information (including billing address), email address(es), and an IP address, if available.</li>
<li>A court order is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or other information related to a user account (not including contents of communications), which may include message headers and IP addresses, in addition to the basic user records identified above.</li>
<li>A search warrant properly issued under the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant procedures, based on a showing of probable cause, is required to compel the disclosure of the stored contents of any account, which may include messages, attachments, or other content of communications within a user&rsquo;s account.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>International Legal Requirements.</strong>
In the case of requests from law enforcement outside of the U.S., a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) request or letter rogatory may be required to compel the disclosure of the contents of an account.</li>
<li><strong>Account Preservation Requests.</strong>
We will take reasonable steps to preserve account records in connection with official criminal investigations for a period of 90 days pending our receipt of a formal legal request for user data.  You may request the preservation of records via email, fax or mail as indicated below.</li>
<li><strong>Information Required in Connection With Your Request.</strong>

<ol start="4">
<li>Your Contact Information.

<ol>
<li>Requesting Agency&rsquo;s name</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s name</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s badge/identification number</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s Agency-issued Email address</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s telephone number, including extension</li>
<li>Requesting Agent&rsquo;s mailing address (PO Box not acceptable)</li>
<li>Requested response date (please allow at least 3 weeks for processing)</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Data Request Information

<ol start="8">
<li>Full (first and last) name of the Asana User</li>
<li>Email address(es) associated with the User&rsquo;s account</li>
<li>A clear and specific description of the data being requested (we will be unable to process overly broad or vague requests)</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>Data Availability.</strong>
We will search for and disclose data that is specified with particularity in an appropriate form of legal process and which we are reasonably able to locate and retrieve.</li>
<li><strong>User Notification.</strong>
Asana&rsquo;s policy is to notify users of requests for their information, which includes a copy of the request, prior to disclosure so that they may have an opportunity to challenge such request unless: (a) we are prohibited from doing so by law or court order; (b) there are exceptional circumstances, such as an emergency involving the risk of bodily injury or death to a person or group of people or potential harm to minors; or (c) prior notice would be counterproductive (for example, if we believe that the account in question has been hijacked).
Law enforcement officials who believe that notification would jeopardize an investigation should obtain a proper court order or other appropriate process establishing that notice is prohibited.  Please note that Officer authored affidavits, cover letters or similar statements are not sufficient to preclude notice to our users.
Please note that in situations where a data request draws attention to an ongoing violation of our Terms of Service we may, in order to protect our service and its Users, take action to prevent any further abuse, including actions that could notify the User(s) who are the subject of your data request that we are aware of their misconduct.</li>
<li><strong>Submitting Your Request.</strong>
A data request may be served by fax to (415) 484-7702, by certified mail, express courier, or in person at our corporate headquarters at the following address:
<strong>Asana, Inc., 1550 Bryant Street, 8th Floor, San Francisco, CA 94103</strong></li>

                    <h3>Asana Subprocessors</h3>

<p class="-label">Last Updated: June 7, 2018</p>

<p>In connection with our provision of the Services, Asana and its affiliates may engage third parties (each a “Subprocessor”) to process your Personal Data.  In certain circumstances an affiliate of Asana may even be a Subprocessor. As a condition of permitting a Subprocessor to process your Personal Data, Asana (and its affiliates as applicable) will enter into a written agreement with each Subprocessor containing data protection obligations at least as protective as the technical and organizational measures Asana has put into place to protect your Personal Data from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorized disclosure or access. All terms capitalized above, but not defined have the meaning set forth in Asana’s <a href="#terms-of-service">User Terms of Service</a>, <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, and/or your applicable customer agreement with Asana.</p>

                    <h3>Asana’s Commitment to GDPR Compliance</h3>

<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) is a European law establishing protections for the personal data of EU residents that came into force on May 25, 2018. Under the GDPR, organizations that collect, maintain, use, or otherwise process EU residents’ personal data (regardless of the organization’s location) must implement certain privacy and security safeguards for that data. Asana has established a comprehensive GDPR compliance program and is committed to partnering with its customers and vendors on GDPR compliance efforts. 
Some significant steps Asana has taken to align its practices with the GDPR include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Revisions to our policies and contracts with our partners, vendors, and users</li>
<li>Enhancements to our security practices and procedures</li>
<li>Closely reviewing and mapping the data we collect, use, and share</li>
<li>Creating more robust internal privacy and security documentation</li>
<li>Training employees on GDPR requirements and privacy/security best practices generally</li>
<li>Carefully evaluating and building a data subject rights’ policy and response process
Below, we provide additional details about the core areas of Asana’s GDPR compliance program and how customers can use Asana to support their own GDPR compliance initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Processing Agreements</h4>

<p>Under the GDPR, “data controllers” (i.e. entities that determine the purposes and means of processing data) are required to enter into agreements with other entities that process data on their behalf (called “data processors”). Asana offers its customers who are controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into a robust data processing agreement under which Asana commits to process and safeguard personal data in accordance with GDPR requirements. This includes Asana’s commitment to process personal data consistent with the instructions of the data controller.</p>

<h4>International Data Transfers</h4>

<p>As with prior EU data protection laws, the GDPR requires organizations to use a recognized legal mechanism to transfer data from the EU to other countries that do not have a similar data protection framework, including the United States. To comply with this requirement, Asana is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield framework, which requires it to maintain certain safeguards for personal data transferred to the United States. Additionally, Asana offers customers who are data controllers of EU personal data the option to enter into EU Model Contractual Clauses with us upon request.</p>

<h4>Data Access, Management, and Portability Tools</h4>

<p>The GDPR gives individual data subjects in certain circumstances the rights to, among other things, access, delete, and make corrections to their data. Asana is committed to facilitating data subject requests consistent with the GDPR, as further described in our <a href="/terms#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Privacy Documentation</h4>

<p>At its core, the GDPR is focused on transparency, fairness, and accountability. Accordingly, the law requires organizations to maintain documentation about their privacy practices and their decisions about how they handle individuals’ personal data. Asana shares the GDPR’s commitment to these principles, and has included within its ongoing GDPR compliance program documentation about its data collection and processing activities, and the various policies and guidelines it follows pursuant to the GDPR. You can learn more about how Asana collects, uses, and discloses personal data by visiting Asana’s <a href="/terms#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

<h4>Data Security</h4>

<p>The GDPR requires organizations to use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of personal data. Security continues to be a priority for Asana: we are now SOC 2 Type 1 certified (read more about our certification <a href="https://blog.asana.com/2018/09/asana-soc-2-type-1-audit/">here</a>) and have implemented a variety of safeguards to protect the security of our platform, including encrypting web connections to protect data transmissions, replicating our databases to support reliability of the platform, and controlling access to our facilities and office network. Asana also offers customers the ability to use additional security controls to further enhance the security of their teams’ data. For more information, please see our <a href="/security-statement">Security Statement</a>.</p>

<h4>Ongoing Compliance and Communication</h4>

<p>The GDPR’s requirements are comprehensive, but the law and regulatory guidance will evolve.  As data protection authorities in Europe interpret the GDPR’s requirements and issue guidance, we will continue to follow these developments closely and evaluate our program for any changes or enhancements as needed.
We value communication with our customers. If you have any questions about our GDPR compliance efforts, or if you are a data controller customer with questions about how we can help support your own GDPR compliance efforts, please contact us at privacy@asana.com.</p>
