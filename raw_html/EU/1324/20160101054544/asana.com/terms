<p class="p--label">Last Updated: April 27, 2015</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>These Terms of Service (&#8220;Terms“) govern your use of the free services, software and websites (the “Service&#8221;) provided by Asana, Inc. (“Asana”). Our <a href="#privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> explains the way we collect and use your information and our <a href="#acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> outlines our expectations with respect to your behavior when using the Service. By using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms, our Privacy Policy and our Acceptable Use Policy.  If you’re using our Service on behalf of an organization or entity (“Organization”), then you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of that Organization and you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind the Organization to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” refers to that Organization.  If you become a paid subscriber to Asana’s premium Service, then your use of the Service will be governed by our <a href="/terms#subscriber-agreement">Subscriber Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3>Your Content</h3>

<p>The Service allows you to create tasks and associated information, text, files and other materials (together the &#8220;Content&#8221;) and to share that Content with others. You retain ownership of your Content, but by uploading it onto the Service, you are granting us a license to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, publish, transmit, host and display that Content for the purpose of (i) providing you the Service and associated support; and (ii) analyzing and improving the operation of the Service.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to remove Content on the Service that violates our Acceptable Use Policy or these Terms or that we otherwise reasonably believe may create liability for Asana.</p>

<h3>Your Obligations</h3>

<ul>
<li>You must provide accurate information when you create your Asana account.</li>
<li>You are responsible for safeguarding the password and for all activities that occur under your account. You should notify Asana immediately if you become aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</li>
<li>You must comply with our Acceptable Use Policy at all times when using the Service.</li>
<li>You may never use another user’s account without permission.</li>
<li>You may not disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Service or attempt or assist anyone else to do so, unless such restriction is prohibited by law.</li>
<li>Our Service is not intended for use by persons under the age of 13. By using the Service you are representing to us that you are over the age of 13.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Use of Asana Software</h3>

<p>As part of the Service, we provide downloadable client software (the &#8220;Software&#8221;) for your use in connection with the Service.  This Software may update automatically and if such Software is designed for use on a specific mobile or desktop operating system, then a compatible system is required for use. So long as you comply with these Terms, we grant you a limited, nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable license to use the Software, solely to access the Service; provided, however, that this license does not constitute a sale of the Software or any copy thereof, and as between Asana and You, Asana retains all right, title and interest in the Software.  If you are using our API to develop an application based on our Service, you will be subject to our <a href="/terms#api-terms">API Terms</a>.</p>

<h3>Administrator Access to Your Content</h3>

<p>When you sign up for our Service, you associate one or more email addresses with your account. If you use an email address provided to you by a third party entity of which you are a part (such as yourname@youremployer.com or yourname@nonprofit.org) (each an &#8220;Entity&#8221;) you hereby grant that Entity and its administrator(s) permission to access, use, download, export, disclose, share, restrict and/or remove Content that you have associated with the email address that includes their domain. You acknowledge and understand that an Entity may elect to utilize one or more third party applications in connection with their teams’ use of the Service and that, by associating Content with an email address that includes an Entity’s domain, you are granting permission to have such Content shared with such third party application(s). You also acknowledge and understand that an Entity may restrict or terminate your access to Content associated with the email address that includes their domain.  <strong>Please remember that you can associate more than one email address with your Asana account, so you may want to consider associating personal Content with a personal email address</strong>.</p>

<h3>Your Use of Third Party Applications</h3>

<p>If you elect to utilize any third party application in connection with your use of the Service, by doing so you are consenting to your Content being shared with such third party application. To understand how such third party application provider utilizes your Content and other information, you should review their privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Security</h3>

<p>We will use industry standard technical and organizational security measures in connection with the storage, processing and transfer of your Content that are designed to protect the integrity of that Content and to guard against unauthorized or unlawful access to, use of, or processing of such Content.</p>

<h3>Termination</h3>

<p>You are free to stop using our Service at any time.  We also reserve the right to suspend or end the Service at any time at our discretion and without notice. We may also terminate or suspend your access to the Service at any time if you are not complying with these Terms or our <a href="/terms#acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a> or if you are using the Service in a manner that we believe may cause us financial or legal liability.</p>

<h3>Asana’s Intellectual Property Rights</h3>

<p>The Service (excluding Content provided by users) constitutes Asana’s intellectual property and will remain the exclusive property of Asana and its licensors.  Any feedback, comments, or suggestions you may provide regarding the Service is entirely voluntary and we will be free to use such feedback, comments or suggestions as we see fit and without any obligation to you.</p>

<h3>Copyright</h3>

<p>Asana respects the intellectual property rights of others and we expect our users to do the same.  We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement if they comply with the law, and such notices should be reported to our Copyright Agent using the process set forth in our <a href="#dmca-policy">DMCA Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Modifications to the Service</h3>

<p>The Service may be modified from time to time, often without prior notice to you.  Your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of such modifications. If you are not satisfied with a modification we make to the Service, your sole remedy is to terminate your use of the Service.</p>

<h3>Indemnification</h3>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Asana and its licensee and licensors, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from your use of and access to the Service or the Software, or from or in connection with any Content uploaded to the Service through your account by a third party using your account with your knowledge or consent.</p>

<h3>No Warranty</h3>

<p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN &#8220;AS IS&#8221; AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  ASANA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY THIRD PARTY CONTENT THAT YOU DOWNLOAD OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICE OR FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT MAY RESULT. WE DO NOT WARRANT, ENDORSE, GUARANTEE, OR ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION OR SERVICE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO OUR SERVICE (E.G., ANY THIRD PARTY APPLICATION DEVELOPED USING ASANA’S API).</p>

<p>The Service is controlled, operated and hosted from within the U.S.  We make no representations that the Service is appropriate or available for use in other locations. Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own risk and are responsible for compliance with all applicable United States and local laws and regulations, including but not limited to export and import regulations.</p>

<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>

<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL ASANA, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE, WHETHER OR NOT ASANA HAS BEEN WARNED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. ASANA’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATED TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF $100 OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO ASANA IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE CLAIM GIVING RISE TO SUCH LIABILITY.</p>

<h3>Dispute Resolution</h3>

<p>*Informal Efforts - *You agree that prior to filing any claim against Asana relating to or arising out of these Terms you will first contact us at <a href="https://asana.com">dispute-notice@asana.com</a> to provide us with an effort to resolve the issue in an informal manner.</p>

<p><em>Arbitration -</em> If such dispute is not resolved to our mutual satisfaction within 30 days of submission, then either party may bring a formal claim, which claim shall be resolved through final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&#8220;AAA&#8221;).</p>

<p>*Arbitration Procedures and Fees- *The AAA will administer arbitration proceedings under its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. Arbitration will be held in the United States county where you live or work, in San Francisco, CA, or in any other location we agree to.  The AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. Asana will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than $75,000. If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer we make to resolve the claim, we will pay you $1,000 in addition to the award.  Asana will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>

<p><em>Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate -</em> Either you or Asana may assert a claim, if it qualifies, in small claims court in San Francisco, CA or any United States county where you live or work.  Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Service or intellectual property infringement (for example, trademark, trade secrets, copyright or patent rights) without first engaging in arbitration or the informal dispute resolution process.</p>

<p><em>No Class Actions -</em> ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT ALLOWED.</p>

<li><strong>Obligations</strong>.  Except as otherwise expressly permitted under this Services Agreement, with the express prior written consent of the disclosing party, or as required by law, the receiving party will not disclose, transmit or otherwise disseminate to a third party any Confidential Information of the disclosing party.  The receiving party will use the same care and discretion with respect to the Confidential Information received from the disclosing party as it uses with its own similar information, but in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Asana may disclose Customer’s Confidential Information to its employees, consultants, agents or advisors who have a strict need to know such Confidential Information solely for the purpose of performing Asana’s obligations under this Agreement and only to those who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information upon terms at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement. Customer may disclose Asana’s Confidential Information to its employees, consultants, agents or advisors who have a strict need to know such Confidential Information and are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of such Confidential Information upon terms at least as protective as those contained in this Agreement.</li>
<li><strong>Exclusions</strong>.

The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party if legally required to do so in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding, provided, however, that in such event the receiving party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, notify the disclosing party within a reasonable time prior to disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party an opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Indemnification</strong>.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>By Customer</strong>.  Customer hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Asana, its licensees and licensors, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors (together, the &#8220;Asana Affiliates&#8221;), from and against any and all liabilities, damages, obligations, losses, costs and expenses (including but not limited to reasonable attorney’s fees) (together, the “Losses”) arising from or as a result of any claim by a third party against Asana or the Asana Affiliates regarding: (i) use of or access to the Service by Customer or its End Users in violation of this Subscriber Agreement or our <a href="/terms#acceptable-use">Acceptable Use Policy</a>; or (ii) any data or Customer Content transmitted or received through Customer’s account.</li>
<li><strong>By Asana</strong>.  Asana hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Customer and its employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors (together the &#8220;Customer Affiliates&#8221;), from and against any and all Losses arising from or as a result of any claim by a third party against Customer or the Customer Affiliates to the extent based on an allegation that the Service or Asana’s technology used to provide the Service infringes or misappropriates any copyright, trade secret, U.S. patent, or trademark right of the third party. In no event will Asana have any obligations or liability under this section arising from: (i) use of the Service in a modified form or in combination with materials not furnished by Asana; (ii) use of any third party app developed using Asana’s API; or (iii) any content, information, or data provided by Customer, End Users, or other third parties.  THIS INDEMNITY IS CUSTOMER’S ONLY REMEDY UNDER THIS SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT FOR ANY VIOLATION BY ASANA OF ANY THIRD PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</li>
<li><strong>Infringement Claims</strong>.  If the Service becomes, or in Asana’s reasonable judgment is likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement, then Asana may: (i) obtain the right, at Asana’s expense, for Customer to continue using the Service; (ii) provide a non-infringing functionally equivalent replacement; (iii) modify the Service so that it is no longer infringing.  If Asana, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then Asana may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service and provide Customer with a pro rata refund of prepaid fees.</li>
<li><strong>Process</strong>.  The party seeking indemnification will provide prompt notice concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. Failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations hereunder only to the extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The indemnifying party will have full control and authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that: (i) the indemnified party may join in the defense at its own expense using counsel of its choice; and (ii) any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment will require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>.  TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER THIS SUBSCRIBER AGREEMENT FOR (I) ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES; OR (II) LOSS OF USE, DATA, BUSINESS REVENUES, PROFITS (IN EACH CASE WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT), GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ASANA BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN BY ANY  THIRD PARTY.

                <div class="tab-pane" id="amendment-to-asana-subscriber-agreement"><h3>Amendment to Asana Subscriber Agreement</h3>

<h2>Applicable to U.S. Government Customers</h2>

<p class="p--label">Last Updated: May 29, 2015</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is a supplemental agreement (&#8220;Amendment&#8221;) between Asana and U.S. Government customers (the “Customer” or the “Agency”) and applies to the Agency’s use of Asana’s collaborative workplace management service (the “Service”) under Asana’s Premium Subscriber Agreement (the “Subscriber Agreement”).</p>

<p>The reason for this Amendment is that the Customer, a U.S. Government instrumentality, is obligated to follow federal laws, regulations, and practices, among which are those relating to ethics, advertising and endorsements, tax exemption and immunity, limitations on indemnification, fiscal law constraints, governing law and jurisdiction, dispute resolution, and assignment of contracts.</p>

<p>Asana and Agency (the &#8220;Parties&#8221;) agree that modifications to the Subscriber Agreement available at <a href="https://asana.com/terms#subscriber-agreement">https://asana.com/terms#subscriber-agreement</a> are appropriate to accommodate the Agency’s legal status, its public mission, and other special circumstances.  Therefore, the Subscriber Agreement is modified by this Amendment as follows.</p>

<p>A. <strong><em>Government entity</em></strong>: As it relates to the Agency’s usage of the Service, the word &#8220;Customer&#8221; in the Subscriber Agreement shall mean the Agency itself and shall not apply to, nor bind (i) the individual(s) who utilize the Asana Service on the Agency&#8217;s behalf, or (ii) any individual users who happen to be employed by, or otherwise associated with, the Agency. Asana will look solely to the Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Subscriber Agreement by such individuals, subject to federal law.</p>

<p>B. <strong><em>Advertisements</em></strong>: Asana agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Asana site that display content uploaded by or under the control of the Agency.</p>

<p>C. <strong><em>Taxes</em></strong>: With reference to Section 5 of the Subscriber Agreement, the Parties understand that the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 29.302 (48 CFR, Chapter 1, Part 29, Subpart 29.302 – Application of State and local taxes to the Government) states that &#8220;Generally, purchases and leases made by the Federal Government are immune from State and local taxation.&#8221; Therefore, Asana will include no tax in Agency billings unless the tax has been determined by the Agency to be proper for payment.</p>

<p>D. <strong><em>Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations</em></strong>: Any provisions in the Subscriber Agreement related to indemnification by the customer, damages, attorneys fees, filing deadlines, defense of lawsuits, collection expenses, and settlement are hereby waived. Liability of either party for any breach of the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Subscriber Agreement or this Amendment, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Contract Disputes Act, or other governing federal authority. Federal Statute of Limitations provisions shall apply to any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Subscriber Agreement or this Amendment.</p>

<p>E. <strong><em>Governing law and Forum</em></strong>: The Subscriber Agreement and this Amendment shall be governed by, and interpreted and enforced in accordance with, applicable federal laws of the United States of America without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by federal law, the laws of the State of California including its choice of law rules will apply in the absence of applicable federal law. Any arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution provision in the Subscriber Agreement is hereby waived. The forum for purposes of resolving claims and disputes will be determined in accordance with federal law.</p>

<p>F. <strong><em>No automatic renewal</em></strong>: With respect to Section 5 of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees to waive the provision allowing Asana to automatically charge the Agency upon a renewal date associated with Customer’s account. Asana agrees to remove the auto-renew default setting for any Agency whose account details page designates an email address that ends in .gov, .mil, or .fed.us.  Instead, Asana will notify the Agency to allow the Agency to determine if funds are available and if the Service will be needed for a renewal period.</p>

<p>G.  <strong><em>Continuity of service during dispute</em></strong>: With respect to Section 6 of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees to waive the language that would otherwise permit Asana to terminate the Premium Subscription contract in the event of an alleged breach of the Agreement by the Agency. Instead, recourse against the United States for any alleged breach of the Agreement must be made under the terms of the Federal Tort Claims Act or as a dispute under the Contract Disputes Act, as applicable. During the resolution of the dispute the Contractor, Asana, shall proceed diligently with performance of the contract, pending final resolution of any request for relief, claim, appeal, or action arising under the contract, and comply with any decision of the Agency Contracting Officer.</p>

<p>H. <strong><em>Limitation of liability</em></strong>: The Parties agree that nothing in the limitation of liability provision in Section 10 or elsewhere in the Subscriber Agreement in any way grants Asana a waiver from, release of, or limitation of, liability pertaining to any past, current or future violation of federal law.</p>

<p>I. <strong><em>No endorsement</em></strong>: With reference to Section 4(d) of the Subscriber Agreement, Asana agrees that the Agency’s name, seals, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and the fact that the Agency has a presence on the Asana site and uses its Services, shall not be used by Asana in such a manner as to state or imply (in the judgment of a reasonable person) that Asana&#8217;s products or services are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by the Agency or by any other element of the Federal Government, or are considered by the Agency or the Federal Government to be superior to any other products or services. Except for pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, Asana agrees not to display any Agency or Government names, seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on Asana&#8217;s homepage or elsewhere on the Asana Site unless permission to do so has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant federal government authority.  Asana may list the Agency&#8217;s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other third-party customer.</p>

<p>J. <strong><em>Assignment</em></strong>: As indicated in Section 11(e) of the Subscriber Agreement, neither party may assign its obligations under the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment to any third party without prior written consent of the other. However, if Agency is using Asana’s free services only, Asana or its subsidiaries may, without the Agency’s consent, assign the Subscriber Agreement as modified by this Amendment to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets. Any transfer of Asana assets related to the Agency’s paid subscription contract requires review and consent by the Agency, under the procedures found in the FAR Subpart 42.13 (48 CFR Chapter 1, Part 42, Subpart 42.12 - Novation).</p>

<p>K. <strong><em>Precedence; Further Amendments</em></strong>: If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Subscriber Agreement, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules or policies on the Asana site or related to its Service, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment constitutes a mutually agreed upon amendment to the Subscriber Agreement; language in the Subscriber Agreement in Section 11(e) indicating it alone is the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. Any further amendment must be agreed to in writing by both Parties.</p>

<p>L. <strong><em>Posting of Amendment</em></strong>: This Amendment shall be posted with the Asana’s online Subscriber Agreement either by incorporation of its text or via an integral link.</p></div>
                <div class="tab-pane" id="amendment-to-asana-subscriber-agreement"><h3>Amendment to Asana Terms for Free Service</h3>

<h2>Applicable to U.S. Government Customers</h2>

<p class="p--label">Last Updated: July 23, 2015</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>This is a supplemental agreement (“Amendment”) between Asana and U.S. Government users (“You” or the “Agency”) and applies to the Agency’s use of Asana’s free services, software and websites (the “Service”) under the Terms of Service found at <a href="/terms">https://asana.com/terms</a> (“Terms”).</p>

<p>The reason for this Amendment is that the Agency, a U.S. Government entity, is obligated to follow Federal laws, regulations, and practices, among which are those relating to ethics, advertising and endorsements, limitations on indemnification, fiscal law constraints, governing law and jurisdiction, and dispute resolution.</p>

<p>Asana and Agency (the &#8220;Parties&#8221;) agree that modifications to the Terms are appropriate to accommodate the Agency’s legal status, its public mission, and other special circumstances.  Therefore, the Terms are modified by this Amendment as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Government entity:</strong> As it relates to the Agency’s use of the Service, the words &#8220;you&#8221; and “your” in the Terms shall mean the Agency itself and shall not apply to, nor bind (i) the individual(s) who utilize the Service on the Agency&#8217;s behalf, or (ii) any individual user(s) who happen(s) to be employed by, or otherwise associated with, the Agency. Asana will look solely to the Agency to enforce any violation or breach of the Terms by such individuals, subject to Federal law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Advertisements:</strong> Asana agrees not to serve or display any third-party commercial advertisements or solicitations on any pages within the Asana site that display content uploaded by or under the control of the Agency.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indemnification, Liability, Statute of Limitations:</strong> Any provisions in the Terms related to indemnification by you and any provisions related to damages, attorneys fees, filing deadlines, defense of lawsuits, collection expenses, and settlement are hereby waived. Instead, liability of either party for any breach of the Terms as modified by this Amendment, or any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Terms as modified by this Amendment, shall be determined under the Federal Tort Claims Act, Contract Disputes Act, or other governing Federal authority. Federal Statute of Limitations provisions shall apply to any claim, demand, suit or proceeding arising from the Terms or this Amendment.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Governing law and Forum:</strong> The Terms and this Amendment shall be governed by, and be interpreted and enforced in accordance with, applicable Federal laws of the United States without reference to conflict of laws. To the extent permitted by Federal law, the laws of the State of California including its choice of law rules will apply. Any arbitration, mediation or other dispute resolution provision in the Terms is hereby waived. Instead, the forum for purposes of resolving claims and disputes will be determined in accordance with Federal law. Agency agrees, however, prior to filing any claim against Asana, to first contact the company at dispute-notice@asana.com (https://asana.com) to provide Asana an opportunity to resolve the issue in an informal manner.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Limitation of liability:</strong> The Parties agree that nothing in the Limitation of Liability section of the Terms or elsewhere in the Terms in any way grants Asana a waiver from, release of, or limitation of, liability pertaining to any past, current or future violation of Federal law.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>No endorsement:</strong> Asana agrees that the Agency’s name, seals, logos, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and the fact that the Agency has a presence on the Asana site and uses the Service, shall not be used by Asana in such a manner as to state or imply, in the judgment of a reasonable person, that Asana&#8217;s services, software and websites are endorsed, sponsored or recommended by the Agency or by any other element of the Federal government, or are considered by the Agency or the Federal government to be superior to products or services from other sources. Except on pages whose design and content is under the control of the Agency, Asana agrees not to display any Agency or Government names, seals, trademarks, logos, service marks, and trade names on Asana&#8217;s websites unless permission to do so has been granted by the Agency or by other relevant Federal government authority.  Asana may list the Agency&#8217;s name in a publicly available customer list on its homepage or elsewhere so long as the name is not displayed in a more prominent fashion than that of any other user or subscriber.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assignment:</strong> If the Agency is using Asana’s free services only, Asana or its subsidiaries may, without the Agency’s consent, assign these Terms and any rights and licenses granted hereunder to an affiliate or to a successor or acquirer, as the case may be, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization or consolidation, or the sale of all or substantially all of its assets. However, the Parties agree that any transfer of Asana assets related to the Agency’s paid subscription contract requires review and consent by the Agency under the procedures found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 42.13 (48 CFR Chapter 1, Part 42, Subpart 42.12 - Novation).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Precedence; Further Amendments:</strong> If there is any conflict between this Amendment and the Terms, or between this Amendment and other terms, rules or policies on the Asana websites or related to its Service, this Amendment shall prevail. This Amendment constitutes a mutually agreed upon amendment to the Terms; language in Terms in the section entitled Entire Agreement indicating the Terms alone are the entire agreement between the Parties is waived. Any further amendment must be agreed to in writing by both Parties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posting of Amendment:</strong> This Amendment shall be posted with the Asana’s online Terms of Service either by incorporation of its text or via an integral link. A related Amendment applicable to Agencies who are customers of Asana’s paid subscriber services is available at <a href="/terms/government-customers">https://asana.com/terms/government-customers</a>.</p></li>
