<h1>MUBI Terms & Conditions</h1>
<p>
Welcome to MUBI, the ultimate destination for watching and engaging with the world’s best films!
We provide our subscribers with access to motion pictures, streamed over the Internet to computers, iOS and Android mobile devices as well as Internet-connected TV's, game consoles and set-top boxes.
These Terms & Conditions are subject to change without prior written notice at any time, in Company’s sole discretion, and such changes shall apply to any purchases made after such changes are posted. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Service prior to each purchase so you will understand the terms applicable to such transaction. If you do not agree to these Terms & Conditions, do not make any purchases.
</p>
<p>
PLEASE READ THESE TERMS & CONDITIONS CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS, AND A DISPUTE RESOLUTION CLAUSE THAT GOVERNS HOW DISPUTES WILL BE RESOLVED.
</p>
<ol class='decimal'>
<li>
<h2>Registered Users, Subscribers, Free Trials, Billing and Cancellation</h2>
<div class='indent'>
<h3>Becoming a Registered User</h3>
<p>
You may register as a MUBI registered user of the Website free of charge (a "User"). To become a User, submit your email address to MUBI and create a password. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer.
</p>
<h3>Ongoing Subscription.</h3>
<p>
Your MUBI monthly, semi-yearly, or yearly subscription, which may start with a free trial, will continue month to month, semi-year to semi-year, or year to year unless and until you cancel your subscription. You must have Internet access and provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment to use the MUBI Subscription service. We will bill the subscription fee to your Payment method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment method.
</p>
<h3>Free Trials</h3>
<ul class='indent'>
<li>
Your free trial period will commence by clicking ‘Free Trial’, selecting a plan and completing the registration process.
</li>
<li>
The free trial period of your subscription lasts for 7 days, or as otherwise specified. Free trials are for new and certain former users only. MUBI reserves the right, in its absolute discretion, to determine your free trial eligibility.
</li>
<li>
We will begin billing your Payment method for subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the specific details of your trial or your subscription, visit our website and click the "Subscription" link under settings available at the top of the pages of the MUBI website.
</li>
<li>
You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun. We will continue to bill your Payment method for your subscription fee until you cancel.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Billing</h3>
<ul class='indent'>
<li>
<h4 class='inline'>Recurring Billing.</h4>
By starting your MUBI subscription, you authorize us to charge you a monthly, a semi-annual, or an annual subscription fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the MUBI service to your Payment method.
</li>
<li>
<h4 class='inline'>Price Changes.</h4>
We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms & Conditions, any price changes to your service will take effect following email notice to you.
</li>
<li>
<h4 class='inline'>Billing Cycle.</h4>
The subscription fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription unless and until you cancel your subscription. We automatically bill your Payment method monthly, semi-yearly, or yearly on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment method has not successfully settled. In the event your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if you started your MUBI monthly subscription or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and your Payment method would be billed on that date. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your Subscription.
</li>
<li>
<h4 class='inline'>No Refunds.</h4>
PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period.
</li>
<li>
<h4 class='inline'>Payment methods.</h4>
You may edit your Payment method information by visiting our website and clicking on the "Subscription" under settings. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment method information or cancel your account, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. If you signed up for MUBI using your account with a third party (i.e., iTunes, Google Play, Sony Entertainment Network or similar account) as a Payment method, and wish to cancel your MUBI subscription at any time, including during your free trial, you will need to do so through such third party, including by visiting your account with the applicable third party and turning off auto-renew, or unsubscribing from the MUBI service. You may also find billing information about your MUBI subscription by visiting your account with the applicable third party. For certain Payment methods, the issuer of your Payment method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or other charges. Check with your Payment method service provider for details.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cancellation</h3>
<p>
You may cancel your MUBI subscription at any time, and you will continue to have access to the MUBI service through the end of your billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS. To cancel, go to the "Subscription" under settings.
</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Passwords & Account Access</h2>
<ol class='alpha indent'>
<li>
A User has access and control over the MUBI account. A user’s control is exercised through use of the user's password and therefore to maintain exclusive control, the user should not reveal the password to anyone. In addition, if the user wishes to prohibit others from contacting MUBI Customer Service and potentially altering the user’s control, the user should not reveal the Payment method details (e.g., last four digits of their credit or debit card) associated with their account. You are responsible for updating and maintaining the truth and accuracy of the information you provide to us relating to your account.
</li>
<li>
BY SHARING THE MUBI SERVICE PASSWORD OR ALLOWING OTHERS TO ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT, THE USER AGREES TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ASSURING THAT HOUSEHOLD SUBSCRIBERS COMPLY WITH THE TERMS & CONDITIONS AND SUCH USER SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE HOUSEHOLD SUBSCRIBERS.
</li>
<li>
You should be mindful of any communication requesting that you submit credit card or other account information. Providing your information in response to these types of communications can result in identity theft. Always access your sensitive account information by going directly to the MUBI website and not through a hyperlink in an email or any other electronic communication, even if it looks official. MUBI reserves the right to place any account on hold anytime with or without notification to the member in order to protect itself and its partners from what it believes to be fraudulent activity. MUBI is not obligated to credit or discount a subscription for holds placed on the account by either a representative of MUBI or by the automated processes of MUBI.
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Governing Law</h2>
<p>
These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the country in which the entity that is providing the MUBI service to you (as defined above) has its registered offices. These terms will not limit any consumer protection rights that you may be entitled to under the mandatory laws of your local jurisdiction
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<p class='indent'>
You may encounter third-party applications (including, without limitation, websites, widgets, software, or other software utilities) ("Application(s)") that interact with the MUBI service. These Applications may import data related to your MUBI account and activity and otherwise gather data from you. These Applications are provided solely as a convenience to you, and MUBI is not responsible for such Applications. SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE OWNED OR OPERATED BY THIRD PARTIES THAT ARE NOT RELATED TO WITH OR SPONSORED BY MUBI AND MAY NOT BE AUTHORIZED FOR USE WITH OUR SERVICE IN ALL COUNTRIES. USE OF AN APPLICATION IS AT YOUR OWN OPTION AND RISK.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<h2>Use of Information Submitted.</h2>
<p class='indent'>
MUBI is free to use any comments, information, ideas, concepts, reviews, techniques or any other material contained in any communication you may send to us ("Feedback"), including responses to questionnaires or through postings to the MUBI service, including the MUBI website and user interfaces, without further compensation, acknowledgement or payment to you for any purpose whatsoever including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and creating, modifying or improving the MUBI service. In addition, you agree not to enforce any "moral rights" in and to the Feedback, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Please note MUBI does not accept unsolicited materials or ideas for movies, and is not responsible for the similarity of any of its content or programming in any media to materials or ideas transmitted to MUBI. Should you send any unsolicited materials or ideas, you do so with the understanding that no additional consideration of any sort will be provided to you, and you are waiving any claim against MUBI and its affiliates regarding the use of such materials and ideas, even if material or an idea is used that is substantially similar to the material or idea you sent.
