<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you choose to decline acceptance of all cookies, your ability to browse certain pages of the site may be reduced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cookies used by Mailjet are intended to enable or facilitate communication, to enable the services requested by users to be supplied, to recognise users when they next visit, to secure payments which users may make, to register the language spoken by users or other preferences necessary for the service requested to be supplied and to enable Mailjet, internally, to carry out analyses on the hit rate and browsing experience of its customers on its site information pages so as to improve content, to track the email opening rate, click rate and bounce-back rates at individual level.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data originating from third parties, collected and submitted by you in the context of using services supplied by Mailjet: Emailing campaigns and distribution lists</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailjet has access to all the information contained in the email distribution lists you create in your account, as well as the subject and content of the emails which you send to your circulation lists via Mailjet’s services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data are stored on secure servers and only a limited number of people are authorised to access your distribution lists, in particular for the purpose of providing support services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are easily able to recover your distribution lists from your Mailjet account at any time, by clicking on the “export” button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In no case does Mailjet sell, share or rent out your distribution lists to third parties, nor does it use them for any purposes other than those set forth herein. We will use the information from your distribution lists only for legal requirements, to invoice and collect summaries for our own statistics and for the purposes of providing you with customer support services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you give your express consent, the use you make of your distribution lists, the subject and content of the emails you send out to them via Mailjet’s services together with the behaviour of the recipients of these emails may be analysed and tracked particularly with regard to browsing experience, opening rates, click rates and bounce-back rates at individual level, so as to enable you (if you are signed up for a specific Mailjet service) to refine and improve your email campaigns (behavioural marketing).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are reminded that </span><b>as a creator of circulation lists and associated email campaigns, you are the data controller</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the meaning of European Directive 95/46/CE, Mailjet is acting here only as a provider of services. In this capacity, you are responsible in particular for:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; making all the declarations necessary to the relative data protection authority and for complying with all current regulations in force</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; obtaining the consent of the persons concerned when collecting their personal data,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; ensuring that you have the authority to use the personal data collected in accordance with the defined end purposes and refraining from any unauthorised use.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Data retention</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailjet collects the data for the requirements of carrying out its contractual obligations and retains the same in active databases so long as you are a customer of and use the services of Mailjet (the contract binding us has not been terminated) or as the case may be, to the extent the data has surpassed 10 gigabytes in volume, and in accordance with the current regulations in force.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Mailjet in no way undertakes to store these data indefinitely. You are able to access some of these data so long as you hold an active account with us and for a period that varies depending on the type of data concerned. The data may be deleted at any time in accordance with the provisions set forth above.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location of data storage and transfers</span></h3>
</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The host servers on which Mailjet processes and stores its databases are located exclusively within the European Union.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mailjet undertakes not to transfer any data outside the European Economic Area and/or any third party country recognised by the European Commission as having an adequate level of protection.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Mailjet undertakes to inform you immediately, to the extent we are legally authorised to do so, in case of any application or order originating from an administrative or judicial authority relating to your data.</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Within the framework of its services, Mailjet attributes the very highest importance to the security and integrity of its customers’ personal data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thus and in accordance with EU Directive 95/46/CE, Mailjet undertakes to take all pertinent precautions in order to preserve the security of the data and, in particular, to protect them against any accidental or unlawful destruction, accidental loss, corruption, unauthorised circulation or access, as well as against any other form of unlawful processing or disclosure to unauthorised persons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To this end, Mailjet implements industry standard security measures to protect personal data from unauthorised disclosure. In using industry recommended methods of encoding, Mailjet takes the measures necessary to protect information connected with payments and credit cards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, in order to avoid in particular all unauthorised access, to guarantee accuracy and the proper use of the data, Mailjet has put the appropriate electronic, physical and managerial procedures in place with a view to safeguarding and preserving the data gathered through its services. In particular, these measures are as follows:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Multilevel firewalls,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Tried and tested anti-virus programs and unauthorised intruder attempts detection,</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211; Encrypted transmission of data with SSL/https/VPN technology.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothwithstanding this, there is no absolute safety from piracy or hackers. That is why in the event a breach of security were to affect you, Mailjet undertakes to inform you thereof as soon as possible and to use its best efforts to take all possible measures to neutralise the intrusion and minimise the impacts thereof. Should you suffer any loss by reason of the exploitation by a third party of a security breach, Mailjet undertakes to provide you with every assistance necessary so you are able to assert your rights and obtain reparation.
