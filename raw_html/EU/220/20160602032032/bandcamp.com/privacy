Bandcamp automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.  These third-party partners also may collect information about your online usage activities over time and on other websites or mobile applications.</li>
    <li>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Bandcamp only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Service or services so that we can make the Service appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Bandcamp never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</li>
</ul>

<h4>E-mail Communications:</h4>

Bandcamp uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful and improve our service. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please send your request to <a href="mailto:support@bandcamp.com">support@bandcamp.com</a>.</p>

<h4 id="cookies">What About Cookies?</h4>

<p><i>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</i> We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through Bandcamp's Service. In other situations, Bandcamp provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share your Personal Information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business, if you have agreed to be solicited by marketing partners during the registration process.</p>
 
<p><i>Agents:</i> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Examples may include sending postal mail and e-mail, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. Unless we tell you differently, Bandcamp’s agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of Personal Information for the above purposes.</p>

<p><i>Bands:</i> When you use certain functionality or services, we may provide certain personal information to bands, such as your e-mail address, country of residence and zip/postal code ("Fan Information") to add you to the relevant band's mailing list.

<p><i>User profiles:</i> User profile information including users’ name, email address, purchase history and other information you enter (“User Submissions”) may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Service. Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.

You may designate certain User Submissions, including individual items in your purchase history, as private, in which case they will not be displayed to other users.</p>

<p><i>Business Transfers:</i> In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Bandcamp, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Bandcamp goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Bandcamp may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p>

<p><i>Protection of Bandcamp and Others:</i> We may access, preserve, and disclose collected information, if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to: comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order or subpoena; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Bandcamp, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
    
<p><i>With Your Consent:</i> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>
