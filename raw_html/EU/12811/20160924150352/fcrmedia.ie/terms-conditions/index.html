<p align="center"><a name="_GETDOMAINS_-_SERVICES"></a><strong>GETDOMAINS &#8211; SERVICES AGREEMENT and TERMS AND CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Agreement </strong></p>
<p>In this Services Agreement (this &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) &#8220;you,&#8221; &#8220;your,&#8221; &#8220;Subscriber&#8221; and &#8220;Customer&#8221; refer to each customer and &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to FCR Media Limited (&#8220;getdomans.ie&#8221;). This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us regarding your use of Getdomains.ie services. By registering a domain name through one of our registrar partners or using any other services provided by getdomains.ie or its partners under this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by all Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, any registrar agreement associated with our service, our Privacy Policy and any other pertinent rules or policies that are or may be published by getdomains.ie from time to time. Notwithstanding any other written or oral statements you believe getdomains.ie may have made to you, this agreement constitutes the entirety of getdomains.ie&#8217; agreements with and obligations to you and the entirety of your contractual rights in your relationship with getdomains.ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Domain Registration Service </strong></p>
<p>When Getdomains.ie registers a domain in response to your order; you acknowledge that the duration of the initial registration term may vary slightly depending on the method we use to fulfil your order. If the domain was registered to you via a registrar transfer, the registration term will be for 365 days from the date of expiration listed in the whois for that domain. In order to assist you in identifying and determining the status of domain names you may wish to order, Getdomains.ie offer on its site Whois look-up services. Information about the status of a domain name is offered on a commercially reasonable basis. You should always attempt to obtain independent confirmation of a domain name&#8217;s status by performing a Whois look-up, found on the website of any ICANN-accredited registrar, including Getdomains.ie&#8217; partners, prior to placing an order. Unless a Customer specifies nameservers that should be assigned to the ordered domain name upon its registration, all domain names registered through Getdomains.ie are pointed to a nameserver controlled by Getdomains.ie. The landing page then provided may be modified at any time by Getdomains.ie without prior notice to you and may include such things as, without limitation (i) links to additional products and services offered by Getdomains.ie, (ii) advertisements for products and services offered by third-parties, and (iii) an internet search engine interface. Once a domain name is registered for you, if for any reason you do not wish to have your domain name pointed to this web page, you should change the nameserver settings for that domain by accessing the domain at the acquiring registrar by using the account login information provided by Getdomains.ie and/or the registrar at the time of the registration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Placing an Order</strong></p>
<p>Once an order is placed it is an offer for contract and does not mean that we will necessarily be able to fulfil the order, it should be construed as an offer to treat only. There are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil a particular order (including but not limited to: unavailability of a domain name, registration policies, pricing errors, technical errors etc.). Details will be collected about you and your application, and you will also be able to make payment via credit card etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your order is subsequently processed, we will phone or email you in respect of each domain name, hosting account or other product that is successfully provisioned. Please note that domain registrations in particular may not be performed in real time, so we cannot guarantee that any or all registrations will be successful until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question. In the case of .ie and other managed top-level domains, you may have to conform to specific registration policies and provide adequate supporting documentation to support your application. Please note that a non-refund policy applies to domain registrations and transfers that we could not complete because of a failure to provide authorisation or correct supporting information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all cases, the application must be accompanied by payment for the minimum registration period. Payment methods may include but not limited to credit card, cheque, or electronic transfer. VAT at the prevailing rate (currently 23%) will be charged on all invoiced amounts unless you are VAT exempt (supporting documentation required). Please note that domain registration fees are not refundable once the domain has been registered or renewed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst we at all times use our best endeavours to process orders as quickly as possible, you hereby accept that domain registrations and acquisitions of domains may not be performed in real time and orders may not in certain circumstances be capable of being fulfilled. As we cannot guarantee that any or all domain registrations or acquisitions will be successful or available for registration or acquisition until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question, this may result in domains not being available for registration or acquisition and/or result in the costs of registering/acquiring a particular domain or domains increasing as a result of circumstances beyond our control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you place an order with us, in the event that (i) the domain is not or may not be available for registration or acquisition; and/or (ii) the market valuation of the domain is already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) the costs of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed, then you agree and fully accept that we shall (i) not liable for any domain(s) that is/are unavailable for registration or acquisition and/or not capable of being registered or acquired (as well as any costs incurred thereto by you); and/or (ii) not be required to pay for nor shall we be liable to you or be required to remit to you any increased cost(s) associated with registering/acquiring a domain or domains where the market valuation of the domain(s) is or are already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has or have been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) not be liable under any circumstances whatsoever for any such increased cost(s) where the cost(s) of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed howsoever arising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept the above and you agree that you shall indemnify us and that you do hereby fully indemnify us in all respects and you further agree that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated above, there are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil an order or orders (including, but not limited to, unavailability of a domain or domains, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors etc.) as events occur or may have occurred which were or are beyond our control. When you place an order with us, in the event that it is not possible to fulfil a particular order or orders due to, amongst other things, the unavailability of a domain or domain, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors, then you agree that we shall not be liable for and we shall not be required to pay for and we shall not be liable to remit any cost(s) associated with or incurred and shall not be liable to make good any loss arising as a result of our not being able to fulfil an order and/or orders howsoever such cost(s) or loss arise(s) and howsoever our inability to fulfil an order and/or orders arise(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept that the list of reasons set out above shall not and cannot be regarded as exhaustive and is used for illustration purposes. You agree that you shall be liable for; shall be required to pay for and shall be liable to remit any increased cost(s) associated with the circumstances contemplated above (and which circumstances shall not be regarded as exhaustive) and you hereby agree that on placing your order and/or orders with us, you fully indemnify us and shall continue to indemnify us in that regard and further that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Required Data </strong></p>
<p>In order for us to register a domain name through one of our registrar partners on your behalf, you agree to provide certain current, complete, accurate, and reliable contact data at the time of registration (the &#8220;Contact Data&#8221;) about you and your site host as required by the registration process. You acknowledge that the registrar is required to make Contact Data publicly available on a WHOIS database as expressed in the respective registrar&#8217;s service agreement, and you expressly consent to such disclosure. You agree to update this information as follows: (i) if your Contact Data changes after you have supplied it to us, but before we order a domain name registration on your behalf, you agree to update the information as it appears in your account on this Website; and (ii) if your Contact Data changes after we order a domain name registration on your behalf, you agree to update the information directly with the registrar. (Please note that updating Contact Data on our site will not change the information maintained by the registrar in its WHOIS database on any of your existing domain registrations, even if the registration was facilitated by Getdomains.ie; you must update existing domain registrations directly with the registrar.) Because accurate and reliable Contact Data is important for the domain name system to work properly, is will be considered a material breach of this Agreement if you: (i) wilfully provide inaccurate or unreliable Contact Data, (ii) wilfully fail promptly to update Contact Data with us and/or the registrar, or (iii) fail to respond within fifteen days to our enquiries or those of the registrar regarding the accuracy of the Contact Data. Such a breach will be a sufficient basis for us or the associated registrar to cancel the domain name registration and/or other services without further notice to you.</p>
<p>In order for you to use other Getdomains.ie services you also agree to provide and maintain certain current, complete, accurate, and reliable information about you and your email addresses (&#8220;User Profile&#8221;). The User Profile information is needed to send you notifications and other information regarding your service. The User Profile information is entirely independent of the Contact Data described above. You agree to update the User Profile directly through your account accessible at our Website. Because it is not possible for us to provide our notification services without accurate and reliable User Profile information, it will be considered a material breach of this Agreement if you (i) wilfully provide inaccurate or unreliable User Profile information, or (ii) wilfully fail promptly to update User Profile information provided to us. Such a breach will be a sufficient basis for us to cancel the services without further notice to you. Our Privacy Policy located on our Website at <a href="http://www.getdomains.ie/">www.getdomains.ie</a> and incorporated herein by reference, further sets forth your and our rights and responsibilities with regard to your personal information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. Modification of Agreement </strong></p>
<p>You acknowledge that the Internet, the domain name system and its policies, and the practice of registering, monitoring, and administering domain names are continually evolving, and therefore you agree that Getdomains.ie may modify this Agreement, as well as any additional rules or policies that are or may be published by Getdomains.ie, as necessary to comply with any other agreements that Getdomains.ie is currently bound by or will be bound by in the future, as well as to adjust to changing business circumstances. Any such addition or modification will be binding and effective immediately upon posting of the revised Agreement or change to the service(s) on Getdomains.ie&#8217; Website, or upon notification to you by e-mail. You agree to periodically review this Website, including the current version of this Agreement available on this Website, to be aware of any such modifications. Your continued use of any Getdomains.ie services or of any domain name registered through one of our registrar partners on your behalf through Getdomains.ie will constitute your acceptance of this Agreement as well as modified or additional rules or policies that are or may be published by Getdomains.ie or by our registrar partners. If you do not agree to any such changes, you may request that any order you placed be cancelled. You acknowledge and agree that such cancellation will be your exclusive remedy and our sole liability if you do not wish to abide by any changes to this Agreement or any additional rules or policies that are or may be published by Getdomains.ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>6. Agency </strong></p>
<p>IF YOU ARE ACTING AS AN AGENT: You represent that you have the authority to bind your principal to all Terms and Conditions contained in this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that if you license the use of your registered domain name to a third party, you remain the domain name holder and/or subscriber of record and remain responsible for all obligations under this Agreement, including payment obligations, and providing and updating full contact information. A breach of this Agreement by your principal or licensee will be considered a breach by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE ACTING THROUGH AN AGENT: You agree that, if your agent (e.g., an Internet Service Provider, employee, legal counsel, etc.) purchased our service(s) on your behalf, you are nonetheless bound as a principal by all Terms and Conditions herein, including the Dispute Policy as described later in this Agreement. Your continued use of our services will ratify any unauthorised actions of your agent. By acting on your behalf, your agent certifies that he or she is authorised to apply for our services on your behalf, that he or she is authorised to bind you to the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement and that he or she has apprised you of the Terms and Conditions of this Agreement. In addition, you are responsible for any errors made by your agent. A breach of this Agreement by your agent will be considered a breach by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>7. Prohibited Conduct </strong></p>
<p>You, the customer, agrees to use Getdomains.ie only for lawful purposes. While Getdomains.ie has no responsibility to monitor your use of domain names, Getdomains.ie reserves the right to terminate any account for which a Getdomains.ie hosted domain is found to be pointing or otherwise directing traffic to any material in violation of any Irish Law or regulation, including but not limited to material in violation of copyright law, and material judged to be threatening or obscene. Any misuse of Getdomains.ie resources that disrupts the normal use of the system is strictly prohibited. Such system abuse may lead to termination of the account. Examples of system abuse include but are not limited to spawning many processes that consume resources, consuming excessive amounts of disk storage or main memory or CPU for long periods of time, etc. Any attempts to penetrate Getdomains.ie&#8217; security will result in the termination of the Customers&#8217; account without notice, as well as notification of appropriate law-enforcement agencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>8. Breach </strong></p>
<p>Any failure by you to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any Getdomains.ie operating rule or policy or the Dispute Policy, may be considered by us to be a material breach of this Agreement. We may provide written notice, describing the breach, to you. If within ten (10) calendar days of the date of such notice, you fail to provide evidence that is reasonably satisfactory to us that you have not breached your obligations under the Agreement, then we may delete the registration or reservation of your domain name or terminate the services without further notice. We reserve the right to suspend any Getdomains.ie services during such 10-day period. Any such breach by you will not be deemed to be excused simply because we did not act earlier in response to that, or any other, breach by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>9. Revocation </strong></p>
<p>You agree that we may terminate your right to use our service(s) if the information that you are obligated to provide to register your domain name through one of our registrar partners or subscribe for other Getdomains.ie service(s), or that you subsequently modify, contains false or misleading information, or conceals or omits any information we would likely consider material to our decision to register your domain name through one of our registrar partners or to continue to provide you domain name services. Furthermore, you agree that we may suspend, cancel or transfer your domain name services in order to: (i) correct mistakes made by us, a registrar partner, or the registry in registering your chosen domain name, or (ii) to resolve a dispute under the Dispute Policy. We will not refund any fees paid by you if we suspend or terminate your services.</p>

<p><strong>13. Dispute Policy </strong></p>
<p>We do not check to see whether the domain name you select to register infringes the legal rights of others.

You may wish to consider seeking one or more opinions from competent trademark practitioners in connection with your domain name. You agree to assume all responsibility in selecting a domain name to register and/or monitor. Should we be sued or threatened with a lawsuit in connection with your domain name and/or subscription to any other of our services, we may turn to you to hold us harmless and indemnify us pursuant to the Indemnification provision of this agreement. Similarly, you recognise that we have no responsibility to determine whether domain names monitored or acquired by others through our site infringe your own rights in trademarks or domain names, and you agree to release Getdomains.ie from any legal claims asserting such a responsibility.</p>
<p>For domain name registrations facilitated by Getdomains.ie, you agree to be bound by the UDRP, as approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999, as modified from time to time, and incorporated here by reference. A copy of the current UDRP may be found at <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm%C2%A0and">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm and</a> any modifications at <a href="http://www.icann.org/">www.icann.org</a>.

<p>Getdomains.ie has partnerships with registrars for the purpose of registering domain names. Our registration service entails Getdomains.ie registering domain names on your behalf with one of our registrar partners. Other than what is specifically stated in this Agreement regarding our registration of domain name service, it is the agreements between the particular registrar associated with a given domain name and the registrant of said domain name that will explain your rights and obligations when you register a domain name through Getdomains.ie. By this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read and accept the terms of these respective registrar agreements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>17. Domain Registrations</strong></p>

No liability shall attach to IE Domain Registry Ltd or its servants or agents in respect of any loss or damage whatsoever suffered by the applicant or a service provider and arising from any action or neglect on the part of IE Domain Registry Ltd or its servants or agents in the exercise of the function of the naming authority. Registrant accepts that failure to pay the maintenance fee will result in the deactivation of the domain name. Registrant agrees to the resolution of disputes in respect of the domain name applied for in accordance with IE Domain Registry’s Dispute Resolution Policy (ieDRP) in force for the time being, but that this is without prejudice to any and all rights registrant has in the name applied for and shall not prevent any party to the proceeding from submitting the dispute to a court of law for independent resolution at any time. There are a number of restrictions on allowable .ie domain names as well as the general requirement for a real and substantive connection with Ireland. Depending on the class of applicant and the category of domain name, supporting documentation is often required. Please read the following documents carefully IE Registrations Terms and Conditions Registration Policy Dispute Resolution Policy (DRP) Your registration of a .ie domain is subject to the above Registration Terms, Conditions and Policies which form part of your Terms and Conditions of service with Getdomains.ie In the case of all .ie domain name registrations, additional supporting documentation is required to validate your claim to a domain name. Applications for .ie domain names must be completed within 28 days of the initial order; otherwise the IE Domain registry will cancel the pending application and make the domain name available for registration by other parties. For some registration types, information such as company, registered business name or trademark numbers may be submitted at the time of application and this may be sufficient to complete the registration. For most other registrations you are required to submit additional documents or other background information in order to complete the registration. You must respond to such requests by us in order to allow us to complete your application in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>17(b) International Registrations: International Registrations in the .com, .net, .org, .biz and .info top-level domains, including the new domains such as .club, .support etc. are performed through various ICANN accredited registrars. There are fewer restrictions on what names can be registered, or on who can register them. It is a condition of registration that you read and are bound by the uniform dispute resolution policy (URDP). Please read the UDRP document below carefully. Additionally, you are bound by the individual Terms and Conditions of the individual registrar selected. Uniform Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Expiration of Domain Names Immediately after the expiration of the term of domain name registration services and before deletion of the domain name in the applicable registry’s database, we may direct the domain name to name-servers and IP address(es) designated by us, including, without limitation, to no IP address or to IP address(es) which host a parking page or a commercial search engine that may display advertisements, and we may either leave your WHOIS information intact or we may change the contact information in the WHOIS output for the expired domain name so that you are no longer the listed registrant of the expired domain name.</p>
<p><strong>18. Reactivation Period</strong></p>
<p>For a period of approximately 30 calendar days after expiration of the term of domain name registration services, we may provide a procedure by which an expired domain name registration or other services may be renewed. We may, but are not obligated to, offer this process, called the “reactivation period”. You assume all risks and all consequences if you wait until close to or after the expiration of the original term of domain name registration services to attempt to renew the domain name registration services. We may, in our sole discretion, choose not to offer a reactivation period and we shall not be liable therefore. The reactivation period renewal process, if any, may involve additional fees. We may make expired domain name services(s) available to third parties, we may elect to become the registrant or record of expired domains, we may auction off the rights to expired domain name services (the auction beginning close to the end or after the end of the reactivation period), and/or expired domain name registration services may be re-registered to any party at any time.</p>

<p>All domain names that are registered through our services are subject to these terms of service, as well as the rules and regulations of the respective registry and any contractual obligations that may exist between the registrant and the registrar where the registrar is not gethosting.ie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The registration of the international domain name extensions (.com/.net/.org/.info/.biz) are governed by the <a title="External Link" href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp.htm" target="_blank">ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) UDRP (Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>‘.IE’ domain name registrations are subject to the rules and regulations governing registrations as defined by the <a title="External Link" href="http://www.iedr.ie/" target="_blank">IEDR</a>. Domain name disputes are governed by the <a title="External Link" href="http://www.iedr.ie/DisputeRes.php" target="_blank">IE Dispute Resolution Policy (IEDRP).</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst we at all times use our best endeavours to process orders as quickly as possible, you hereby accept that domain registrations and acquisitions of domains may not be performed in real time and orders may not in certain circumstances be capable of being fulfilled. As we cannot guarantee that any or all domain registrations or acquisitions will be successful or available for registration or acquisition until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question, this may result in domains not being available for registration or acquisition and/or result in the costs of registering/acquiring a particular domain or domains increasing as a result of circumstances beyond our control.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you place an order with us, in the event that (i) the domain is not or may not be available for registration or acquisition; and/or (ii) the market valuation of the domain is already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) the costs of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed, then you agree and fully accept that we shall (i) not liable for any domain(s) that is/are unavailable for registration or acquisition and/or not capable of being registered or acquired (as well as any costs incurred thereto by you); and/or (ii) not be required to pay for nor shall we be liable to you or be required to remit to you any increased cost(s) associated with registering/acquiring a domain or domains where the market valuation of the domain(s) is or are already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has or have been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) not be liable under any circumstances whatsoever for any such increased cost(s) where the cost(s) of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed howsoever arising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept the above and you agree that you shall indemnify us and that you do hereby fully indemnify us in all respects and you further agree that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated above, there are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil an order or orders (including, but not limited to, unavailability of a domain or domains, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors etc.) as events occur or may have occurred which were or are beyond our control. When you place an order with us, in the event that it is not possible to fulfil a particular order or orders due to, amongst other things, the unavailability of a domain or domain, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors, then you agree that we shall not be liable for and we shall not be required to pay for and we shall not be liable to remit any cost(s) associated with or incurred and shall not be liable to make good any loss arising as a result of our not being able to fulfil an order and/or orders howsoever such cost(s) or loss arise(s) and howsoever our inability to fulfil an order and/or orders arise(s).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept that the list of reasons set out above shall not and cannot be regarded as exhaustive and is used for illustration purposes. You agree that you shall be liable for; shall be required to pay for and shall be liable to remit any increased cost(s) associated with the circumstances contemplated above (and which circumstances shall not be regarded as exhaustive) and you hereby agree that on placing your order and/or orders with us, you fully indemnify us and shall continue to indemnify us in that regard and further that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>

We reserve the right to suspend any Gethosting.ie services during such 10 calendar day period.

We make no warranty regarding any goods or services purchased or obtained through any of our services or any transactions entered into through such services. No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from us or through our newsletter or Website shall create any warranty not expressly made herein. To the extent that any jurisdiction does not allow the exclusion of such warranties, these disclaimers will apply to the greatest extent possible.<br />
You further acknowledge and agree that your domain name registration is subject to suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification pursuant to the terms of any rules or policies applicable to your domain name registration, including, but not limited to (i) the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), (ii) any policy adopted by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), (iii) any registrar (including Gethosting.ie) or registry administrator procedures, or (iv) any other ccTLD registry administrator procedures.<br />
You also agree that Gethosting.ie shall have the right in its sole discretion to suspend, cancel, transfer or otherwise modify your domain name registration at such time as Gethosting.ie receives (i) a properly authenticated notification from a court of competent jurisdiction, or (ii) an arbitration award requiring the suspension, cancellation, transfer or modification of your domain name registration.<br />
<strong>13. Right of Refusal</strong></p>
<p>You grant Gethosting.ie, in our sole discretion, the right to refuse to register your chosen domain name through one of our registrar partners, to refuse to subscribe you for other Gethosting.ie services, or to request deletion of your domain name at the acquiring registrar or cancel your services within thirty (30) calendar days from receipt of your payment for such services. In the event we request deletion of your domain name or cancel your services within such thirty (30) calendar day period, we may refund your applicable fees. You agree that we will not be liable to you for any loss or damages that may result from any such refusal, deletion or cancellation.<br />
<strong>14. Dispute Policy</strong></p>
<p>We do not check to see whether the domain name you select to register infringes the legal rights of others. We urge you to investigate to see whether the domain name you select or its use infringes legal rights of others. You may wish to consider seeking one or more opinions from competent trademark practitioners in connection with your domain name. You agree to assume all responsibility in selecting a domain name to register and/or monitor. Should we be sued or threatened with a lawsuit in connection with your domain name and/or subscription to any other of our services, we may turn to you to hold us harmless and indemnify us pursuant to the Indemnification provision of this agreement. Similarly, you recognise that we have no responsibility to determine whether domain names monitored or acquired by others through our site infringe your own rights in trademarks or domain names, and you agree to release Gethosting.ie from any legal claims asserting such a responsibility.</p>
<p>For domain name registrations facilitated by Gethosting.ie, you agree to be bound by the UDRP, as approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999, as modified from time to time, and incorporated here by reference. A copy of the current UDRP may be found at <a href="http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm" target="_blank">http://www.icann.org/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm</a> and any modifications at www.icann.org. All other disputes between you and any party other than Gethosting.ie regarding your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of the UDRP may be resolved between you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.</p>
<p>We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name, and/or Gethosting.ie services. You will not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding. In the event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defences deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend ourselves. Gethosting.ie will not honour registrations that Gethosting.ie reasonably believes infringe on its own trademarks. Should you fail to substantially prevail in any lawsuit brought against Gethosting.ie, Gethosting.ie will be entitled to recover its reasonable legal fees and costs from you.<br />
<strong>15. Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
<p>GETHOSTING.IE AND ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES AND CONTRACTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF GETHOSTING.IE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

<p>Gethosting.ie&#8217;s entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Gethosting.ie services provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is limited solely to the amount you paid for such services. IN NO EVENT WILL GETHOSTING.IE&#8217;S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SUBSCRIPTION TO ANY OF OUR SERVICES OR THE REGISTRATION OF THE DOMAIN NAME.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>16. Indemnity</strong></p>
<p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Getdomaingethosting.ies.ie and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, strategic partners and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and Gethosting.ie&#8217; reasonable out-of-pocket costs) relating to or arising under this Agreement (&#8220;Claims&#8221;), your domain name or its use or renewal, the Gethosting.ie.ie services provided hereunder, or your use thereof, including without limitation infringement of any Intellectual Property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any Gethosting.ie operating rule or policy relating to the services provided.

This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the UDRP or any similar policy. When Gethosting.ie.ie is threatened with suit by a third party, Gethosting.ie.ie may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify Gethosting.ie.ie; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by Gethosting.ie.ie to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in deactivation of your domain name and/or any Gethosting.ie.ie service.<br />
