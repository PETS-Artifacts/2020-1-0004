<h2>GETDOMAINS &#8211; SERVICES AGREEMENT and TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<p><strong>1. Agreement </strong><br />
In this Services Agreement (this &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) &#8220;you,&#8221; &#8220;your,&#8221; &#8220;Subscriber&#8221; and &#8220;Customer&#8221; refer to each customer and &#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;us&#8221; and &#8220;our&#8221; refer to FCR Media Limited (&#8220;getdomans.ie&#8221;). This Agreement explains our obligations to you, and explains your obligations to us regarding your use of Getdomains.ie services. By registering a domain name through one of our registrar partners or using any other services provided by getdomains.ie or its partners under this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to be bound by all Terms and Conditions of this Agreement, any registrar agreement associated with our service, our Privacy Policy and any other pertinent rules or policies that are or may be published by getdomains.ie from time to time. Notwithstanding any other written or oral statements you believe getdomains.ie may have made to you, this agreement constitutes the entirety of getdomains.ie&#8217; agreements with and obligations to you and the entirety of your contractual rights in your relationship with getdomains.ie. <br />
 <br />
<strong>2. Domain Registration Service</strong><br />
When Getdomains.ie registers a domain in response to your order; you acknowledge that the duration of the initial registration term may vary slightly depending on the method we use to fulfil your order. If the domain was registered to you via a registrar transfer, the registration term will be for 365 days from the date of expiration listed in the whois for that domain. In order to assist you in identifying and determining the status of domain names you may wish to order, Getdomains.ie offer on its site Whois look-up services. Information about the status of a domain name is offered on a commercially reasonable basis. You should always attempt to obtain independent confirmation of a domain name&#8217;s status by performing a Whois look-up, found on the website of any ICANN-accredited registrar, including Getdomains.ie&#8217; partners, prior to placing an order. Unless a Customer specifies nameservers that should be assigned to the ordered domain name upon its registration, all domain names registered through Getdomains.ie are pointed to a nameserver controlled by Getdomains.ie. The landing page then provided may be modified at any time by Getdomains.ie without prior notice to you and may include such things as, without limitation (i) links to additional products and services offered by Getdomains.ie, (ii) advertisements for products and services offered by third-parties, and (iii) an internet search engine interface. Once a domain name is registered for you, if for any reason you do not wish to have your domain name pointed to this web page, you should change the nameserver settings for that domain by accessing the domain at the acquiring registrar by using the account login information provided by Getdomains.ie and/or the registrar at the time of the registration. <br />
 <br />
<strong>3. Placing an Order</strong><br />
Once an order is placed it is an offer for contract and does not mean that we will necessarily be able to fulfil the order, it should be construed as an offer to treat only. There are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil a particular order (including but not limited to: unavailability of a domain name, registration policies, pricing errors, technical errors etc.). Details will be collected about you and your application, and you will also be able to make payment via credit card etc.<br />
 <br />
When your order is subsequently processed, we will phone or email you in respect of each domain name, hosting account or other product that is successfully provisioned. Please note that domain registrations in particular may not be performed in real time, so we cannot guarantee that any or all registrations will be successful until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question. In the case of .ie and other managed top-level domains, you may have to conform to specific registration policies and provide adequate supporting documentation to support your application. Please note that a non-refund policy applies to domain registrations and transfers that we could not complete because of a failure to provide authorisation or correct supporting information.<br />
 <br />
In all cases, the application must be accompanied by payment for the minimum registration period. Payment methods may include but not limited to credit card, cheque, or electronic transfer. VAT at the prevailing rate (currently 23%) will be charged on all invoiced amounts unless you are VAT exempt (supporting documentation required). Please note that domain registration fees are not refundable once the domain has been registered or renewed.  <br />
 <br />
Whilst we at all times use our best endeavours to process orders as quickly as possible, you hereby accept that domain registrations and acquisitions of domains may not be performed in real time and orders may not in certain circumstances be capable of being fulfilled. As we cannot guarantee that any or all domain registrations or acquisitions will be successful or available for registration or acquisition until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question, this may result in domains not being available for registration or acquisition and/or result in the costs of registering/acquiring a particular domain or domains increasing as a result of circumstances beyond our control. </p>
<p>When you place an order with us, in the event that (i) the domain is not or may not be available for registration or acquisition; and/or (ii) the market valuation of the domain is already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) the costs of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed, then you agree and fully accept that we shall (i) not liable for any domain(s) that is/are unavailable for registration or acquisition and/or not capable of being registered or acquired (as well as any costs incurred thereto by you); and/or (ii) not be required to pay for nor shall we be liable to you or be required to remit to you any increased cost(s) associated with registering/acquiring a domain or domains where the market valuation of the domain(s) is or are already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has or have been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) not be liable under any circumstances whatsoever for any such increased cost(s) where the cost(s) of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed howsoever arising. </p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept the above and you agree that you shall indemnify us and that you do hereby fully indemnify us in all respects and you further agree that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil an order or orders (including, but not limited to, unavailability of a domain or domains, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors etc.) as events occur or may have occurred which were or are beyond our control. When you place an order with us, in the event that it is not possible to fulfil a particular order or orders due to, amongst other things, the unavailability of a domain or domain, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors, then you agree that we shall not be liable for and we shall not be required to pay for and we shall not be liable to remit any cost(s) associated with or incurred and shall not be liable to make good any loss arising as a result of our not being able to fulfil an order and/or orders howsoever such cost(s) or loss arise(s) and howsoever our inability to fulfil an order and/or orders arise(s). </p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept that the list of reasons set out above shall not and cannot be regarded as exhaustive and is used for illustration purposes. You agree that you shall be liable for; shall be required to pay for and shall be liable to remit any increased cost(s) associated with the circumstances contemplated above (and which circumstances shall not be regarded as exhaustive) and you hereby agree that on placing your order and/or orders with us, you fully indemnify us and shall continue to indemnify us in that regard and further that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p><strong>4. Required Data </strong><br />
In order for us to register a domain name through one of our registrar partners on your behalf, you agree to provide certain current, complete, accurate, and reliable contact data at the time of registration (the &#8220;Contact Data&#8221;) about you and your site host as required by the registration process. You acknowledge that the registrar is required to make Contact Data publicly available on a WHOIS database as expressed in the respective registrar&#8217;s service agreement, and you expressly consent to such disclosure. You agree to update this information as follows: (i) if your Contact Data changes after you have supplied it to us, but before we order a domain name registration on your behalf, you agree to update the information as it appears in your account on this Website; and (ii) if your Contact Data changes after we order a domain name registration on your behalf, you agree to update the information directly with the registrar. (Please note that updating Contact Data on our site will not change the information maintained by the registrar in its WHOIS database on any of your existing domain registrations, even if the registration was facilitated by Getdomains.ie; you must update existing domain registrations directly with the registrar.) Because accurate and reliable Contact Data is important for the domain name system to work properly, is will be considered a material breach of this Agreement if you: (i) wilfully provide inaccurate or unreliable Contact Data, (ii) wilfully fail promptly to update Contact Data with us and/or the registrar, or (iii) fail to respond within fifteen days to our enquiries or those of the registrar regarding the accuracy of the Contact Data. Such a breach will be a sufficient basis for us or the associated registrar to cancel the domain name registration and/or other services without further notice to you.   In order for you to use other Getdomains.ie services you also agree to provide and maintain certain current, complete, accurate, and reliable information about you and your email addresses (&#8220;User Profile&#8221;). The User Profile information is needed to send you notifications and other information regarding your service. The User Profile information is entirely independent of the Contact Data described above. You agree to update the User Profile directly through your account accessible at our Website. Because it is not possible for us to provide our notification services without accurate and reliable User Profile information, it will be considered a material breach of this Agreement if you (i) wilfully provide inaccurate or unreliable User Profile information, or (ii) wilfully fail promptly to update User Profile information provided to us. Such a breach will be a sufficient basis for us to cancel the services without further notice to you. Our Privacy Policy located on our Website at www.getdomains.ie and incorporated herein by reference, further sets forth your and our rights and responsibilities with regard to your personal information. </p>

As we cannot guarantee that any or all domain registrations or acquisitions will be successful or available for registration or acquisition until such time as they are processed and completed and your contact details appear on the relevant whois service for the top-level domain in question, this may result in domains not being available for registration or acquisition and/or result in the costs of registering/acquiring a particular domain or domains increasing as a result of circumstances beyond our control. </p>
<p>When you place an order with us, in the event that (i) the domain is not or may not be available for registration or acquisition; and/or (ii) the market valuation of the domain is already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) the costs of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed, then you agree and fully accept that we shall (i) not liable for any domain(s) that is/are unavailable for registration or acquisition and/or not capable of being registered or acquired (as well as any costs incurred thereto by you); and/or (ii) not be required to pay for nor shall we be liable to you or be required to remit to you any increased cost(s) associated with registering/acquiring a domain or domains where the market valuation of the domain(s) is or are already higher than the cost anticipated by us and/or has or have been set at a cost that is higher than the cost anticipated by us; and/or (iii) not be liable under any circumstances whatsoever for any such increased cost(s) where the cost(s) of registering/acquiring a domain and/or domains increase(s) between the time you place the order and time that the order has been processed and completed howsoever arising. </p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept the above and you agree that you shall indemnify us and that you do hereby fully indemnify us in all respects and you further agree that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are many reasons why it may not be possible to fulfil an order or orders (including, but not limited to, unavailability of a domain or domains, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors etc.) as events occur or may have occurred which were or are beyond our control. When you place an order with us, in the event that it is not possible to fulfil a particular order or orders due to, amongst other things, the unavailability of a domain or domain, registration policies, pricing errors, increased prices, technical errors, then you agree that we shall not be liable for and we shall not be required to pay for and we shall not be liable to remit any cost(s) associated with or incurred and shall not be liable to make good any loss arising as a result of our not being able to fulfil an order and/or orders howsoever such cost(s) or loss arise(s) and howsoever our inability to fulfil an order and/or orders arise(s). </p>
<p>You acknowledge that you understand and accept that the list of reasons set out above shall not and cannot be regarded as exhaustive and is used for illustration purposes. You agree that you shall be liable for; shall be required to pay for and shall be liable to remit any increased cost(s) associated with the circumstances contemplated above (and which circumstances shall not be regarded as exhaustive) and you hereby agree that on placing your order and/or orders with us, you fully indemnify us and shall continue to indemnify us in that regard and further that you shall not hold us responsible for any increased or additional cost(s) and/or charge(s) and/or loss under any circumstances whatsoever and howsoever arising.</p>

<p><strong> 15. Dispute Policy</strong><br />
We do not check to see whether the domain name you select to register infringes the legal rights of others. We urge you to investigate to see whether the domain name you select or its use infringes legal rights of others. You may wish to consider seeking one or more opinions from competent trademark practitioners in connection with your domain name. You agree to assume all responsibility in selecting a domain name to register and/or monitor. Should we be sued or threatened with a lawsuit in connection with your domain name and/or subscription to any other of our services, we may turn to you to hold us harmless and indemnify us pursuant to the Indemnification provision of this agreement. Similarly, you recognise that we have no responsibility to determine whether domain names monitored or acquired by others through our site infringe your own rights in trademarks or domain names, and you agree to release Gethosting.ie from any legal claims asserting such a responsibility.   For domain name registrations facilitated by Gethosting.ie, you agree to be bound by the UDRP, as approved by ICANN on October 24, 1999, as modified from time to time, and incorporated here by reference. A copy of the current UDRP may be found at <a href="http://archive.icann.org/en/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm">http://archive.icann.org/en/udrp/udrp-policy-24oct99.htm</a> and any modifications at www.icann.org. All other disputes between you and any party other than Gethosting.ie regarding your domain name registration that are not brought pursuant to the mandatory administrative proceeding provisions of the UDRP may be resolved between you and such other party through any court, arbitration or other proceeding that may be available.   We will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any party other than us regarding the registration and use of your domain name, and/or Gethosting.ie services. You will not name us as a party or otherwise include us in any such proceeding. In the event that we are named as a party in any such proceeding, we reserve the right to raise any and all defences deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend ourselves. Gethosting.ie will not honour registrations that Gethosting.ie reasonably believes infringe on its own trademarks. Should you fail to substantially prevail in any lawsuit brought against Gethosting.ie, Gethosting.ie will be entitled to recover its reasonable legal fees and costs from you.</p>
<p><strong> 16. Limitation of Liability</strong><br />
GETHOSTING.IE AND ITS PARTNERS, AFFILIATES AND CONTRACTORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF GETHOSTING.IE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY AND ALL LOSS OR LIABILITY RESULTING FROM, BUT NOT LIMITED TO:  (a) SUSPENSION, LOSS, OR MODIFICATION OF YOUR DOMAIN REGISTRATION; (b) USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION; (c) INTERRUPTION OF YOUR BUSINESS, WEBSITE, EMAIL, OR OTHER SERVICES; (d) ACCESS DELAYS OR INTERRUPTIONS TO THIS WEBSITE OR ANY WEBSITES ACCESSED BY YOUR REGISTERED DOMAIN NAMES; (e) NON-DELIVERY, MIS-DELIVERY, CORRUPTION, DESTRUCTION, OR MODIFICATION OF DATA; (f) USE OR MISUSE OF YOUR USER NAME OR PASSWORD; (g) FAILURE TO ACQUIRE OR RE-ACQUIRE A DOMAIN NAME; (h) ERRORS, OMISSIONS, OR MISSTATEMETNS IN ANY AND ALL INFORMATION OR SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT; (i) EVENTS BEYOND THE REASONABLE CONTROL OF GETHOSTING.IE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FAILURE OF ELECTRICAL OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES; or (j) APPLICATION OF ANY RELEVANT DISPUTE POLICY OR ANY OTHER ICANN (OR SIMILAR GOVERNMENTAL OR SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION) ADOPTED POLICIES.   Gethosting.ie&#8217;s entire liability, and your exclusive remedy, with respect to any Gethosting.ie services provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is limited solely to the amount you paid for such services. IN NO EVENT WILL GETHOSTING.IE&#8217;S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE LESSER OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR SUBSCRIPTION TO ANY OF OUR SERVICES OR THE REGISTRATION OF THE DOMAIN NAME.</p>
<p><strong>17. Indemnity</strong><br />
You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold Getdomain.ie, gethosting.ie and its directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, strategic partners and affiliates harmless from all liabilities, claims and expenses (including legal fees, expenses, and Gethosting.ie&#8217; reasonable out-of-pocket costs) relating to or arising under this Agreement (&#8220;Claims&#8221;), your domain name or its use or renewal, the Gethosting.ie.ie services provided hereunder, or your use thereof, including without limitation infringement of any Intellectual Property or other proprietary right of any person or entity, or from the violation of any Gethosting.ie operating rule or policy relating to the services provided. You shall not enter into any settlement or compromise of any Claims without Gethosting.ie&#8217; prior written permission, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld. If, in the opinion of Gethosting.ie.ie&#8217; legal counsel, a conflict of interest exists or may reasonably be expected to exist in connection with your assumption of Gethosting.ie&#8217; defence, Gethosting.ie.ie shall be entitled to conduct and control its own defence. This indemnification is in addition to any indemnification required under the UDRP or any similar policy. When Gethosting.ie.ie is threatened with suit by a third party, Gethosting.ie.ie may seek written assurances from you concerning your promise to indemnify Gethosting.ie.ie; your failure to provide those assurances may be considered by Gethosting.ie.ie to be a breach of your Agreement and may result in deactivation of your domain name and/or any Gethosting.ie.ie service.<br />
 <br />

Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.
