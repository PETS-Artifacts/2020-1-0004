  2. PUBLICATION</strong></p>
<p>
  2.1 Subject as hereinafter provided, the Advertisement will appear in the Directories or associated products as designated on the Application <br />
  2.2 FCR Media Limited always endeavours to be as fair and accurate as possible, but FCR Media Limited (including, without limitation, any of its employees or agents) can never predict or give any guarantee or commitment in relation to the position of Advertisements in either the Distributed Directories (as they are laid down on the pages at the production stage of the Directories) or in the Electronic Directories. The positioning of Advertisements is affected by numerous factors including, but not limited to, the number of listings and the location of the start of the classification. FCR Media Limited at all times reserves the right to place Advertisements so as to facilitate page design and layout or to provide improved user experience in the case of the Electronic Directories <br />
  2.3 Positioning of double page spreads cannot be guaranteed due to technical restrictions. To ensure that both the left and facing right hand pages are allocated  together when the directory is being paginated, smaller  advertisements  may be inserted in advance of a double page spread in the relevant classification. The position of double page spreads will be determined at book production stage, and may change up to that point. <br />
  2.4 Where an advertising proof of the Advertisements is provided, such proof is printed on a higher grade paper than that within the Directories, it is important to note that the Advertisements within the directory will be of a different quality to those within the proofs and also that the size and formatting of the Advertisement within the Directories may vary from the proof but the content will remain the same. It should also be noted that in the case of display advertising, anchor listings will continue to be listed alphabetically.<br />
  2.5 The Distributed Directories are delivered to businesses and residential properties free of charge. Additional copies may be purchased pursuant to the terms set out in the Directories. The total distribution for each Directory varies from year to year. Please see clause 15 below which sets out indicative distribution numbers but which shall in no way be binding on FCR Media Limited.<br />
  2.6 With the exception of the platinum product on goldenpages.ie, FCR Media Limited imposes no limit on the number of Applicants whose Advertisements may be included within any classification and geographical zone in the goldenpages. ie Online Database, or in the eircomphonebook.ie Database.<br />
  2.7 FCR Media Limited gives no guarantee of any kind whatsoever as to the frequency with which the Advertisement will be provided to Website Users.<br />
  2.8 FCR Media Limited may at any time in the exercise of its sole discretion interrupt the operation of the Electronic Directories for any reason whatsoever including but not limited to necessary or routine maintenance.</p>

<p>12.14 There are many reasons why it may not be possible for us to fulfil our obligations to you as a result of matters outside of our control as events occur or may have occurred which were or are beyond our control.
