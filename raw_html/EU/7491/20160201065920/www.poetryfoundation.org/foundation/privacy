TPF or its designated agents may remove or alter any user-created content at any time for any reason. Materials posted and/or uploaded to the various public forums may be subject to size and usage limitations. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations. TPF expressly disclaims all responsibility and endorsement and make no representation as to the validity of any opinion, advice, information or statement made or displayed in these forums by third parties, nor are we responsible for any errors or omissions in such postings, or for hyperlinks embedded in any messages.

The opinions expressed in these forums are solely the opinions of the participants, and do not reflect the opinions of TPF. TPF has no obligation whatsoever to monitor any of the content or postings on the message boards, chat rooms or other public forums. However, you acknowledge and agree that we reserve the right to monitor the same at our sole discretion. In addition, we reserve the right to alter, edit, refuse to post or remove any postings or content, in whole or in part, for any reason and to disclose such materials and the circumstances surrounding their transmission to any third party in order to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request and to protect ourselves, our sponsors, users and visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Links to the Website, Frames and Metatags</strong></p>
<p>You may not link to the home page of the Website in any way that might cast TPF in a false or misleading light. You may not frame the Website content so that it is viewed on another site. You may not use metatags or any other "hidden text" that incorporates the name &ldquo;The Poetry Foundation&rdquo; or the Trademarks without our express written consent.</p>
<p><strong>Linked Websites</strong></p>
<p>This Website may contain hyperlinks to sites owned and operated by parties other than TPF. Such hyperlinks are provided only for ready reference and ease of use. We do not control such Websites and are not responsible for their contents. The inclusion of hyperlinks on our Website does not mean that we endorse or approve of any third party site to which you may have access through the linked Websites. We accept no liability for any information, products or services contained in, or which may be linked to through, these third party sites or for any action you may take as a result of linking to any such site. Each of the sites to which you may link are likely to set forth specific terms and conditions of use that you should review. Please review the terms of use and privacy policy of any linked site.</p>
<p><strong>Indemnification</strong></p>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TPF, its directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, attorneys, independent contractors, providers, subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively, &ldquo;TPF and Affiliates&rdquo;) from and against any and all claim, loss, expense, or demand or liability, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by TPF and Affiliates arising out of (i) any claim by a third party relating to the posting, distribution, modification, or alteration by you of any content, or (ii) your use of the Website in violation of these Terms of Use or in violation of any applicable law.</p>
<p>You agree to cooperate with us as reasonably required in the defense of any such claims. TPF and Affiliates reserve the right, at their own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, and you shall not in any event settle any such claim or matter without the written consent of TPF.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The Internet is an open network that is not secure. There is an inherent risk that any transmission via the Internet may be intercepted, modified, misdirected, or not be delivered to the intended recipient. There is also an inherent risk that information stored on a computer connected to the Internet may be accessed without authorization. Although we take reasonable means to protect the security of the information communicated through the Website, no Internet-connected computer system can be made absolutely secure from intrusion. We, therefore, cannot and do not guarantee that information displayed on our Website has not been modified by others without authorization or that information communicated by you to us will be received or that it will not be altered before or after its transmission to us. If you elect to use this Website to communicate with us, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>If you access the Website by registering and creating an account, you must complete the registration process by creating a username and password and providing TPF with current, complete and accurate information, as prompted by the applicable registration form. You are solely responsible for guarding the secrecy of your username and its related password. We encourage you to change your password frequently. Although by diligence and care you may reduce the risk of unauthorized use of your username and password, such risk may not be eliminated. Again, we are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Website; if you elect to use this Website, you, and you alone, have assumed the risk of doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong></p>
<p>We are committed to respecting your privacy and that of the information you provide to us. By using this Website, you consent to the processing of personal information about you as described in the Privacy Policy for this Website, which is hereby incorporated by reference within these Terms of Use.</p>
<p>WE TAKE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IS USED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY. HOWEVER, THE INTERNET IS AN OPEN SYSTEM AND WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ENTERED BY YOU WILL NOT BE MISAPPROPRIATED, INTERCEPTED, MODIFIED, DELETED, DESTROYED, OR USED BY OTHERS. YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD THE POETRY FOUNDATION AND ITS AFFILIATES LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH MISAPPROPRIATION, INTERCEPTION, MODIFICATION, DELETION, DESTRUCTION, OR USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.</p>
