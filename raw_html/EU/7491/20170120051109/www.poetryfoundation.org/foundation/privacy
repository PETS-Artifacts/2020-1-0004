	</strong>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TPF, its directors, officers, employees, agents, licensors, attorneys, independent contractors, providers, subsidiaries, and affiliates (collectively, "TPF and Affiliates") from and against any and all claim, loss, expense, or demand or liability, including attorneys' fees and costs, incurred by TPF and Affiliates arising out of (i) any claim by a third party relating to the posting, distribution, modification, or alteration by you of any content, or (ii) your use of the Website in violation of these Terms of Use or in violation of any applicable law.
</p><p>
	You agree to cooperate with us as reasonably required in the defense of any such claims.

	<strong>Security<br>
	</strong>The Internet is an open network that is not secure. There is an inherent risk that any transmission via the Internet may be intercepted, modified, misdirected, or not be delivered to the intended recipient. There is also an inherent risk that information stored on a computer connected to the Internet may be accessed without authorization. Although we take reasonable means to protect the security of the information communicated through the Website, no Internet-connected computer system can be made absolutely secure from intrusion. We, therefore, cannot and do not guarantee that information displayed on our Website has not been modified by others without authorization or that information communicated by you to us will be received or that it will not be altered before or after its transmission to us. If you elect to use this Website to communicate with us, you do so at your own risk.
</p><p>
	If you access the Website by registering and creating an account, you must complete the registration process by creating a username and password and providing TPF with current, complete and accurate information, as prompted by the applicable registration form. You are solely responsible for guarding the secrecy of your username and its related password. We encourage you to change your password frequently. Although by diligence and care you may reduce the risk of unauthorized use of your username and password, such risk may not be eliminated. Again, we are not responsible for unauthorized access to the Website; if you elect to use this Website, you, and you alone, have assumed the risk of doing so.
</p><p>
	<strong>Privacy<br>

</p><p>
	WE TAKE REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION PROVIDED BY YOU IS USED CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIVACY POLICY. HOWEVER, THE INTERNET IS AN OPEN SYSTEM AND WE CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT PERSONAL INFORMATION ENTERED BY YOU WILL NOT BE MISAPPROPRIATED, INTERCEPTED, MODIFIED, DELETED, DESTROYED, OR USED BY OTHERS. YOU AGREE NOT TO HOLD THE POETRY FOUNDATION AND ITS AFFILIATES LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY SORT INCURRED AS A RESULT OF ANY SUCH MISAPPROPRIATION, INTERCEPTION, MODIFICATION, DELETION, DESTRUCTION, OR USE OF INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THIS WEBSITE.
