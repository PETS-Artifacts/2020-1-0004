<p>The data is also stored in the log files of our system. This data is not stored together with other personal data of the user.</p>

<p><strong>2. Legal basis for data processing</strong></p>

<p>Legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

<p><strong>3. Purpose of data processing</strong></p>

<p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to enable the website to be delivered to the user&#39;s device. For this the IP address of the user must remain stored for the duration of the session.</p>

<p>The data is stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website.</p>

<p>In addition, the data serves us to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>

<p>Our legitimate interest in data processing also lies in these purposes.</p>

<p><strong>4. Storage time</strong></p>

<p>The data will be deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to achieve the purpose for which they were collected. In the case of the collection of data for the provision of the website, this is the case when the respective session has ended.</p>

<p>If the data is stored in log files, this will happen after seven days at the latest. Further storage is possible. In this case, however, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or made anonymous, so that an identification of the accessing client is no longer possible.</p>

<p><strong>5. Recipient of the data and transfer to a third country</strong></p>

<p>As part of the provision of our Internet presence, we forward the aforementioned personal data to International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), 1 New Orchard Rd, Armonk, New York 10504, USA, which takes over hosting as processor with the Softlayer service (cf. Art. 28 GDPR). Your personal data will be processed by IBM in the USA on our behalf in the scope of hosting.</p>

<p>A transfer to IBM Corp. in the USA as a third country within the meaning of the GDPR is permissible according to Art. 44, 45 GDPR, since an appropriate level of data protection is given for the USA in relation to this company.</p>

<p>On the basis of Art 25 para. 6 EU-Personal data directive (1995), the EU Commission has issued an adequacy decision in the form of the so-called EU-US Privacy Shield. The EU-US Privacy Shield is an intergovernmental agreement between the United States and the European Union. This agreement regulates the protection of personal data transferred from a member state of the European Union to the USA. A self-certification procedure by the companies under the supervision of the US authorities ensures that only companies that respect data protection equivalent to that of the EU process personal data from the EU in the USA. IBM Corp. is certified according to the requirements of the EU-US Privacy Shield. This ensures an adequate level of protection for the designated recipients despite the lack of an adequacy resolution by the EU Commission within the meaning of Art. 45 GDPR.</p>
