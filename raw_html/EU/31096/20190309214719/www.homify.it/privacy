				both professionals as well as users is required for the portal to work. In line with
				the portal and its services personal data of users is processed in this context.
				Below we would like to explain in detail how your data is handled in line with the
				portal.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><br></p>
			<p><strong>B. Processing of personal data&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>I. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; General information about
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>

			</p>
			<p>Within the scope of hosting and maintaining our website and the respective IT systems
				our select service providers may, in strict compliance with the relevant data
				protection regulations, receive the data collected on the website. This is based on
				data
				processing contracts under which the carefully selected service providers are bound
				by contract and we remain the controller with respect to data processing.&nbsp;</p>

				server hosting our portal/website. The following information is collected in the
				process:&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>IP address &nbsp;</li>
				<li>Date and time visited&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Information about the browser type and the version used&nbsp;</li>
				<li>Operating system &nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This data is further saved to our system&rsquo;s so-called log files. This data is
				not stored together with other personal data. It is also not shared with third
				parties. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of data processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The system temporarily storing the IP address is necessary to enable delivery of the
				website. This requires storing the IP address for the duration of the session. The
				data is saved to log files to ensure the functionality of the website. The files
				further
				serve optimizing the website and to ensure our IT systems are secure.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for temporary data storage and saving to log files is Article 6(1)(f)
				DSGVO. The required legitimate interest in data processing is the processing
				purposes specified under Item 1.2.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing/erasure of
				data&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Data is erased as soon as it is no longer required for the purposes for which they
				were collected, or if processing is no longer required. With respect to data
				collection and storage to provide the website this is the case when the respective
				session
				has ended. For data saved to log files this is at the latest three months from the
				time it was collected. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right to object&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>According to Article 21 DSGVO you have the right to object to data being processed
				according to Item 1.1 at any time for reasons arising from your particular
				situation. This data will then no longer be processed unless we can verify
				compelling sensitive
				reasons for processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms if
				processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims. The visitor
				can contact us to exercise this objection, especially by e-mailing
				privacy@homify.com.
				If the objection is legitimate, the data will be erased.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Contact form and e-mail
				contact&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>2.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description and scope of data
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>When using our contact form the data entered in the input screen is transmitted to us
				and stored. &nbsp;When submitting your message we will obtain your consent to data
				processing, referencing this privacy policy. We can further be contacted using the
				specified e-mail address. In this case the visitor&rsquo;s personal data transmitted
				by e-mail will be stored. &nbsp;The data is only used to process the respective
				request. Data will not be shared with third parties in this context. With respect
				to the contact form and e-mail inquiries we use service providers &nbsp;(processors)
				located in the USA. These are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Based on
				this agreement between the USA and the European Commission, the latter established
				an appropriate level of data protection for Privacy Shield certified
				companies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of data processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Personal data from the input screen or your&nbsp;</p>
			<p>e-mail is only used to process your inquiry. When&nbsp;</p>
			<p>contacting us by e-mail this also constitutes the necessary legitimate interest in
				processing the data. Other personal data transmitted during the send process will be
				processed for the purpose of preventing misuse of the contact form and to protect
				our
				IT systems.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for data
				processing &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing the data with the visitor&rsquo;s consent (for
				inquiries using the contact form) is Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO. &nbsp; The legal basis
				for processing data transmitted by sending an e-mail is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO. If
				the e-mail
				is for the purpose of entering into a contract, the additional legal basis for
				processing is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The data will be erased as soon as it is no longer required for the purposes for
				which it was originally collected. With respect to personal data from the input
				screen in the contact form and those transmitted by e-mail, this is when the
				respective conversation
				or inquiry with the visitor is completed. The conversation is completed when
				circumstances indicate the respective matter has been conclusively
				resolved. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right to object or withdraw consent &nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The visitor may at any time withdraw his consent to the processing of personal data
				provided when using the contact form. The withdrawal of consent does not apply to
				data processed prior to withdrawing the consent. If the visitor contacts by e-mail,
				he
				may object to his personal data being stored at any time according to Article 21
				DSGVO. In this case the conversation cannot be continued. The visitor can especially
				submit his objection or withdraw his consent by e-mailing privacy@homify.com. &nbsp;In
				these cases the data saved in line with contacting us will be erased.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>IV. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adding contents&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Adding projects&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p><strong>1.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description and scope of processing&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>The portal allows professionals to present their services or work as projects, thus
				also advertising their company and services. The projects published by professionals
				are public on the portal. &nbsp;When adding the project the professional is able to
				provide optional information about the project in the input screen. If the
				professional publishes his project it is published in various areas of the portal to
				advertise the professional&#39;s service and linked to the following information
				from the
				professional&rsquo;s profile - also public - for the purpose of matching the project
				with the respective professional:&nbsp;</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Profile picture</li>
				<li>Company name (required)</li>
				<li>Company category (required)</li>
				<li>City and ZIP (required)</li>
				<li>Phone number</li>
				<li>Social media profile</li>
				<li>URL for the company website</li>
				<li>Professional&rsquo;s achievements&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If the professional uploads pictures of his project under the optional project
				information, registered users on the portal can also add these project pictures to
				their ideabook (see Item III.2.). The respective professional will be listed as the
				reference
				for the project picture, thus advertising the professional&rsquo;s service or
				company. &nbsp;Apart from this, the project data is not shared with third parties.
				In strict compliance with the relevant data protection regulations, in line with
				creating
				and hosting projects, the carefully selected service providers used by us may,
				however, receive the data. This is based on data processing contracts under which
				the carefully selected service providers are bound by contract and we remain the
				controller
				with respect to data processing. &nbsp; With respect to creating the projects we use
				service providers (processors) located in the USA to host any project pictures
				provided by the professional. These are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
				Based
				on this agreement between the USA and the European Commission, the latter
				established an appropriate level of data protection for Privacy Shield certified
				companies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of processing &nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The professional&rsquo;s project data is processed to publish the services or work of
				the professionals in line with the professional&rsquo;s overall presence on the
				portal. This processing is therefore for the purpose of implementing the functions
				on
				the portal in line with the user relationship and used by the
				professional.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing project data is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The professional may at any time deleted his projects. In this case, or at the latest
				after completing implementation of the user contract to use the portal service or
				after deleting your professional profile your data will be deleted or processing
				restricted
				if required based on retention periods under tax and commercial law. The data will
				be erased at the end of the statutory retention periods at the latest unless the
				professional has expressly consented to further use of the data. The data deleted
				generally
				does not include project pictures provided by the professional in line with the user
				relationship which under the terms of use of the portal in individual cases can also
				be used after terminating the professional&rsquo;s registration and for die duration
				of the license granted. In this case the pictures will no longer be linked to the
				respective professional in the portal, and any personal reference will be removed
				when deleting the other data.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Creating an
				ideabook&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>2.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description and scope of processing&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Both users and professionals are able to create so-called ideabooks and publish these
				on the portal. In these ideabooks primarily pictures of projects from professionals
				on the portal are published again. On one hand this is to allow users and
				professionals
				to find ideas and inspiration on the portal, and on the other hand to match
				professionals with platform users, thus marketing the professionals and their
				services. When creating an ideabook the input screen collects a required title for
				the ideabook,
				which is then stored. The input screen also allows the person creating the ideabook
				to add other optional information about his ideabook. The user or professional can
				specifically add pictures from projects of the professionals who published these
				on the portal and add these to the public ideabook. In the process the respective
				professional along with his profile may be referenced on the portal in connection
				with the project picture, thus advertising the professional&rsquo;s service or
				company.
				Apart from this, the data from ideabooks is not shared with third parties. Within
				the scope of hosting the ideabooks the data may be shared with our select service
				providers in strict compliance with the relevant data protection regulations. This
				is based on data processing contracts under which the carefully selected service
				providers are bound by contract and we remain the controller with respect to data
				processing. &nbsp; In line with creating the ideabooks we use service providers
				(processors)
				located in the USA for the purpose of hosting the professional&rsquo;s project
				pictures. These are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Based on this
				agreement between the USA and the European Commission, the latter established an
				appropriate
				level of data protection for Privacy Shield certified companies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The data related to the ideabook is processed to publish the services or work of the
				professionals on the portal and therefore services implementing the portal functions
				offered based on the relationship and used by the professional. This data is further
				processed to allow portal users and experts to find ideas and inspirations,
				specifically also for exchange and interaction between portal users and experts for
				which the portal is intended, thus to implement the functions offered users and
				professional
				in line with the user relationship.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing project data is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The user or professional may at any time delete their ideabooks. In this case or at
				the latest after completing implementation of the user contract or after the
				professional&rsquo;s or user&rsquo;s profile has been deleted, the data will be
				deleted or
				processing restricted if required based on retention periods under tax and
				commercial law. The data will be erased at the end of the statutory retention
				periods at the latest unless the user or professional has expressly consented to
				further use of
				the data. The data deleted generally does not include project pictures provided by
				the professional in line with the user relationship which under the terms of use of
				the portal in individual cases can also be used after terminating the professional&rsquo;s
				registration and for die duration of the license granted. In this case the pictures
				will no longer be linked to the respective professional on the portal if the
				respective expert has closed his portal account, thus removing any personal
				reference.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Writing magazine
				articles&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>3.1 Description and scope of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The portal&rsquo;s online magazine (part of the portal) in some cases also publishes
				editorials on the work or projects of professionals. These are written by homify or
				writers we have hired. In line with this suitable project pictures from the
				professionals
				are used which were uploaded by the professional and the professional has granted
				homify license. These reports also name the respective professional. In line with
				writing editorials for the magazine the pictures of professionals along with the
				professional&rsquo;s
				name and company name may therefore be shared with the writer we have hired. &nbsp;
				To expand the reach of the articles and for the purpose of marketing the portal and
				the professionals and their projects being reported on, homify also publishes these
				articles on third-party websites and in the homify newsletter. The articles and the
				data included are solely shared with third party publishers for the purpose of
				advertising or making these public (to the same extent made public on the portal).
				Within
				the scope of creating and hosting as well as product delivery the data may be shared
				with our select service providers in strict compliance with the relevant data
				protection regulations. This is based on data processing contracts under which the
				carefully
				selected service providers are bound by contract and we remain the controller with
				respect to data processing. &nbsp;In line with writing the articles we use service
				providers (processors) located in the USA to host any project pictures of the
				professional.
				These are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. Based on this agreement between
				the USA and the European Commission, the latter established an appropriate level of
				data protection for Privacy Shield certified companies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The purpose of processing is to write editorials for the magazine section of the
				portal which specifically also serve to inform and inspire portal users and to
				market the professionals. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing the project pictures and the name or company name of
				the professional to write articles for the magazine is Article 6(1)(f) DSGVO. The
				legitimate interest is reporting or exercising the right to free speech.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Subject to the professional&rsquo;s legitimate objection (see Item&nbsp;</p>
			<p>3.5 below) which would result in data being erased, the data is erased after
				achieving the purpose for which it was collected or the legitimate interest of the
				controller in reporting no longer exists or if weighing interests according to
				Article 6(1)(f)
				DSGVO the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the professional requiring
				the protection of personal data prevail. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Right to object&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Under Article 21 DSGVO you generally have the right to object against data processing
				according to Item 3.1 at any time for reasons arising from your personal situation.
				We will then no longer process the data unless we can establish compelling grounds
				for processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms or processing
				serves asserting, exercising or defending legal claims. The user can especially
				submit his objection to us by e-mailing support@homify.com. If the objection is
				legitimate,
				the data will be erased.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>V. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Comments and reviews &nbsp;</strong>
			</p>

			<p><strong>1.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description and scope of processing&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Both professionals and users are able to comment on the projects of professionals and
				ideabooks of users or professionals. These comments are intended for asking
				questions about the respective projects or ideabooks, providing feedback about these
				contents
				and to receive assistance on matters related to the respective publications. The
				user or professional adds his comment using the respective input screen. There is no
				additional information related to professional or user comments. After the user or
				professional posts the comment it is public on the portal. Users comments are
				published under their user name, professional comments under the company name along
				with the professional&rsquo;s profile picture (if a profile picture was added).
				homify
				notifies the professional or user who published the content which was commented on
				of the comment on his content using the e-mail address provided. This also includes
				the user name of the user who commented or the company name of the professional
				who commented. Users and professionals are able to disable this notification in
				their profile settings.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Apart from this the comment data is not shared with third parties. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The comment function is intended for marketing the professional or his services, and
				to promote interaction between members of the portal. The comment function further
				serves the needs of users to obtain information about individual contents or receive
				assistance with their matters. This processing therefore serves the functions
				provided in the portal in line with the user relationship and used by the
				professional or user.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing project data is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The user or professional can delete his comments at any time. The author of the
				respective content which was commented on can further delete the content at any
				time, which will also delete the associated comments. In these cases or at the
				latest after
				full performance of the user contract on the use of the portal services or deleting
				the professional or user profile &ndash; whether commenting or the author of the
				content which was commented on &ndash; the data of the commenting person is
				deleted.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reviews&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p><strong>2.1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Description and scope of processing &nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>Users are able to add a review about their experience with professionals. The
				respective input screen for this purpose is found on the portal. The person
				submitting the review can also provide information about the project the
				professional was used for
				(such as the project address). The user&rsquo;s review is published on the profile
				of the reviewed professional (public). This includes the submitted review
				information (except the project address) and the user name of the user. This user
				name then
				also links to the profile of the user who submitted the review. The professional
				reviewed is notified of this review by e-mail along with the user name of the
				reviewer. This notification can be disabled in the profile settings. The
				professional is
				further able to request a user he on a project for to submit a review. In this case
				the professional also uses an input screen under his profile. In this the
				professional adds the respective free text and the e-mail address of the user he
				would like
				to submit a review. The respective user then receives a notification and is able to
				submit a review using the review input screen.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Purpose of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Processing serves the purpose of reviewing professional services on the portal. This
				provides the user of the portal with another option to contact the respective
				professional and further post his opinion. For professionals the review is an
				opportunity
				to set themselves apart from competitors and also use this to market their service
				or company. This processing therefore serves the functions provided in the portal in
				line with the user relationship and used by the professional or user.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Legal basis for processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The legal basis for processing project data is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2.4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Duration of processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The reviewer can delete the review &ndash; except for the ratings &ndash; at any
				time. This will also delete the review data. If the profile of the reviewed
				professional is deleted, all reviews are also permanently deleted, including the
				respective data.
				If the reviewer deletes his user profile the reviews along with the respective data
				are also deleted except for ratings (which stay without reference to the
				user). &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>VI. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Matchmaking &ndash; requesting
				quotations&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>The term matchmaking refers to the ability for visitors as well as registered users
				to contact professionals on the portal directly with their request, especially
				quotations for projects. This provides professionals on the portal with another
				option to
				market their services.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Description and scope of
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Various areas of the portal and input masks related to ads on advertising networks
				(the respective ads reference the different privacy policies of the advertising
				partners), allow visitors and users of the portal to request quotations for services
				offered
				by the professionals on the portal. Depending on the specific request the request is
				either sent directly to professionals or forwarded to the respective professional
				through homify. &nbsp; The data collected from the input screen is processed solely
				for processing the request of the user or visitor. &nbsp; If the user or visitor
				consented in the input screen, his inquiry is also forwarded to the financial
				institutions specified in the input screen to obtain a financing offer for the
				respective
				project. Apart from this the data is not shared with third parties. In line with the
				controller notifying the professionals on one hand or the user and visitor on the
				other hand using the e-mail addresses we use a service provider (processors) located
				in the USA to send the e-mail. These are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.
				Based on this agreement between the USA and the European Commission, the latter
				established an appropriate level of data protection for Privacy Shield certified
				companies.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purpose of
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Data processing serves the purpose of processing and responding to the inquiry of the
				user or visitor and is therefore also in the interest of the inquirer as well as the
				interest of the professional marketing his services. Processing is therefore for
				the purpose of implementing a key function of the portal.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Legal basis for
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>With respect to the professionals and users or visitors of the portal the legal basis
				for processing is Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO. With respect to the inquiry to obtain a
				financing offer from the financial institutions the legal basis is Article 6(1)(a)
				DSGVO.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Duration of

				the request for a quotation or limits processing if required based on retention
				periods under tax and commercial law. The data is at the latest deleted at the end
				of the
				respective statutory retention period unless the data subject expressly consented to
				further use of their data.&nbsp;</p>

				absolutely require this data for entering into a contract or contract performance
				and the professional is unable to complete the order without this data. The data
				required for payment is transmitted to our external payment service whose website
				the
				professional is redirected during checkout. On said site the payment service
				collects additional information directly which is not shared with homify. The

				visitors to the portal requesting a quotation from the professional for the
				respective user&rsquo;s or visitor&rsquo;s projects free of charge. The professional
				is further able
				to purchase special publications in line with the portal for a fee. &nbsp;When
				placing the order we collect the data from the respective order form on the portal.
				Required data is marked accordingly since we absolutely require this data for
				entering
				into a contract or contract performance and the professional is unable to complete
				the order without this data. The data required for payment is transmitted to our
				external payment service whose website the professional is redirected during
				checkout.
				On said site the payment service collects additional payment information directly

			<p><strong>III. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rights of data subjects&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p><strong>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right of access&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p>According to Article 15 DSGVO you can request the controller to confirm whether we
				process personal data concerning you. &nbsp;</p>
			<p>If your personal data has been processed, you can request to be informed of the
				following:&nbsp;</p>
			<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the purposes for which the personal data is
				processed;<br>&nbsp;(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the categories of personal
				data, which are processed;<br>&nbsp;(3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the
				recipients
				or categories of recipients, to whom your personal data was disclosed or will be
				disclosed;<br>&nbsp;(4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the planned duration of
				the storage of your personal data or, if specific information is not available here,
				criteria for determining the duration of
				storage;<br>&nbsp;(5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the existence of a right to
				rectification or erasure of your personal data, a right to the restriction of
				processing by the controller or a right to object
				to such processing; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;(6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the
				existence of the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority;<br>&nbsp;(7) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;all
				available information on the source of the data
				if the personal data is not collected from the data
				subject;<br>&nbsp;(8) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the existence of automated
				decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at
				least in those cases, meaningful
				information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged
				consequences of such processing for the data subject. You have the right to request
				information on whether or not your personal data is transmitted to a third country
				or an international organization. In this context, you can request being informed
				about the appropriate guarantees in accordance with Article 46 of the GDPR in
				connection with the transmission.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to
				rectification &nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>According to Article 16 DSGVO you have the right to request the controller to rectify
				your data if the personal data processed concerning you is incorrect or incomplete.
				The controller must make the correction without delay.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to restriction of
				processing&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>According to Article 18 GDPR you can request a restriction of the processing of your
				personal data under the following conditions:&nbsp;</p>
			<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;if you contest the accuracy of the personal
				data for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal
				data;<br>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the processing is unlawful and you
				oppose
				the erasure of the personal data and request the restriction of their use
				instead;<br>(3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the controller no longer needs the
				personal data for the purposes of the processing, but they are required by the data
				subject
				for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims,
				or<br>(4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;you have objected to processing pursuant
				to Article 21(1) GDPR pending the verification whether the legitimate grounds of the
				controller override
				those of the data subject. Where processing of your personal data has been
				restricted, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be
				processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal
				claims or for
				the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of
				important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>If processing was restricted according to the preceding conditions, you will be
				informed by the controller before the restriction is lifted.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to erasure&nbsp;</strong>
			</p>
			<p><strong>4.1 Obligation to erase&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>You can request the controller to immediately erase your personal data and the
				controller is obligated to immediately erase said data, provided that one of the
				following reasons applies:&nbsp;</p>
			<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your personal data are no longer necessary in
				relation to the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise processed.<br>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You
				revoke your consent, which was based on processing
				in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Article 9(2)(a) DSGVO, and where there
				is no other legal basis for
				processing. &nbsp;<br>(3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You object to processing
				in accordance with Article 21(1) DSGVO and there are
				no overriding legitimate grounds for processing, or you object to processing
				according to Article 21(2) GDPR. &nbsp;<br>(4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your
				personal data was processed
				illegally. &nbsp;<br>(5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your
				personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or
				Member State law to which the controller is
				subject. &nbsp;<br>(6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your personal data have
				been collected in relation to the offer
				of information society services referred to in Article 8(1) GDPR.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>4.2 Disclosure to third parties&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>If the controller publicized your personal data and is obligated to erase it in
				accordance with Art. 17 sec. 1 of the GDPR, the controller will take appropriate
				measures taking the available technology and implementation costs into account,
				including
				technical means, to inform data controllers, which process the personal data, that
				you have requested them to erase all links to this personal data or copies or
				replications of this personal data. &nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>4.3 Exceptions&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>This right to erasure specifically does not apply if processing is
				required<br>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to exercise the right to freedom
				of expression and information;<br>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to fulfill a
				legal obligation
				required by the law of the European Union or the Member States, which the controller
				is subject to or to carry out a task in the public interest or is carried out in
				exercising official authority, which was delegated to the controller;<br>(3) &nbsp;
				&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;for reasons of public interest in the field of public
				health in accordance with Article 9(2)(h) and (i) as well as Article 9(3) of the
				GDPR;<br>(4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;to assert, exercise or defend legal
				claims.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to
				information&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>If you asserted the right to rectification, erasure or restriction of processing with
				the controller, according to Article 19 GDPR the controller is obligated to notify
				all recipients, to which your personal data was disclosed, of this correction or
				erasure
				of the data or restriction of processing, unless this proves to be impossible or
				involves a disproportionate effort. You have the right to request the controller to
				inform you of these recipients.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to data
				portability&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Under Article 20 GDPR you have the right to receive the personal data you provided to
				the controller in a structured, prevalent and machine-readable format. You also have
				the right to transfer this data to another controller without any hindrance by the
				controller the personal data was made available to, provided that&nbsp;</p>
			<p>(1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the processing is based on consent in
				accordance with Article 6(1)(a) DSGVO or Article 9(2)(a) DSGVO or on a contract in
				accordance with Article 6(1)(b) DSGVO and<br>(2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;processing
				is conducted using automated procedures.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>In exercising this right, you also have the right to initiate that your personal data
				is directly transmitted to another controller by a controller, insofar as this is
				technically feasible. The freedoms and rights of other persons can not be affected
				by this. The right to data portability does not apply to the processing of personal
				data necessary for the performance of a task in the public interest or which takes
				place in exercising official authority, which was delegated to the
				controller.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>7. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Right to file a complaint with a
				supervisory authority&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, according to
				Article 77 GDPR you have the right to file a complaint with a supervisory authority,
				in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, place of work or place
				of
				the alleged infringement if you consider that the processing of your personal data
				infringes the GDPR. &nbsp;The supervisory authority the complaint was filed with
				must inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint including the
				possibility of a judicial remedy in accordance with art. 78 of the GDPR.&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>D. Data security&nbsp;</strong></p>
			<p>To ensure your data is secure we use the commonly used SSL protocol (Secure Socket
				Layer) on our website in conjunction with the highest level of encryption supported
				by your browser. This is typically 256 bit encryption. If your browser does not
				support
				256 bit encryption, we will instead use 128 bit v3 technology. You can determine
				whether a specific page on our website is encrypted by the closed padlock icon in
				your address bar of your browser.</p>
