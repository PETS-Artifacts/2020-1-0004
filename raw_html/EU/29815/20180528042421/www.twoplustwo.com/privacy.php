      <h2> WHAT  TYPE OF INFORMATION MAY BE  COLLECTED?</h2>
      <p>We may  collect the following types of information in order to provide the Service:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Personal       information such as user IDs, passwords, names, email addresses, telephone       numbers, birth dates, and payment information may be collected and stored       upon sign-up for the Service.  We       strongly recommend that you keep passwords unique from other identifiers       such as user ID and league member names to help protect your privacy.</li>
        <li>Emails       that the Service may send out emails for various reasons described in our       Terms of Service and privacy policy may be stored in our database.  The Service may also collect the       confirmation notices of whether you have responded to the email through       the included hyperlinks to ensure you have been properly notified.</li>
        <li>Site       usage information of both registered Users and non-registered users of       varying nature may be collected.        For example, we may collect information based on the links visited       in our site or frequency of visits to enhance features of interest.  We may also collect dynamic IP addresses       to help track the links of Two Plus Two, its subsidiaries, and affiliates       that you may choose during a session.        This type of automatic information we collect may include, without       limitation, such information as the page served, time, source of the       request, type of browser making the request, preceding page view and other       such information.</li>
        <li>Other personal information may be       received from other sources and stored with your User profile.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>HOW MAY THE INFORMATION BE COLLECTED?</h2>                                                                                                
        <p>We may  collect the information described in the previous section through various  methods, including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>The       registration process requires a new user to input various pieces of       personal information as well as create a user ID and password to identify       your capabilities within the Service.        This also includes payment and billing information that may be       required to use certain features of the Service.</li>
        <li>Confirmation       messages from email communications from the Service may be collected.</li>
        <li>Navigation       through the site via links allows us to identify and log your IP       address.  We may collect IP       addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate       information to our affiliates.</li>

      <h2>WHAT IS  TWO PLUS TWO'S PRACTICE REGARDING COOKIES?</h2>
      <p>Your Internet browser has a feature  called cookies, which stores small amounts of data on your computer about your  visit to our site. You do not need to have cookies turned on to visit our site,  although active participation in certain areas of our sites may require  cookies. Cookies alone tell us nothing about who you are unless you  specifically give us personally identifiable information, in which case we use  the information to enhance your services in the ways described below. By  adjusting your settings on your browser, you may elect not to allow cookies to  be collected.</p>
      <p>We also use technologies, including  electronic images known as Web bugs - sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear  GIFs, or beacons - that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We  also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from  your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our  site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for  one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of  tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable  information about you.</p>
      <p>We  use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: </p>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Keeping count of return visits to       our site or our advertisers' or partners' sites;</li>
      </ul>
      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Tracking referrals; </li>
        <li>Accumulating and reporting       anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on       Web-site and advertisement usage; </li>
        <li>Determining which features our       overall forum user population likes best; </li>
        <li>Saving your password so you don't       have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites; </li>
        <li>Displaying the most appropriate       advertising or content based on your interests.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul type="disc">
        <li>Updates or changes to your membership,       including User and contact information may require communications to you       as well as updates to our database.</li>
        <li>Updates or changes to Service may       require communications to you.</li>
        <li>New user registration is       confirmed through information you provide.</li>
        <li>Site usage information is an       important tool to improve the Service in various ways including changes to       the layout and addition or deletion of features. </li>
        <li>Site usage information is also       important to track your personal preferences to ensure navigation within       the site provides you the simplest and most enjoyable level of       entertainment.</li>
        <li>User information also allows us       to monitor the use of the Service’s forums, message boards, chat rooms,       and other areas requiring User input to protect other Users and ensure       compliance with the Terms of Service.</li>
        <li>Confirmation from receipt and       selection of links through emails allows us to track information to better       serve you. </li>
        <li>To help us customize the       advertising and the content you see on our website and on our partner websites; </li>
        <li>To enhance the user experience in       our site. We use tracking information to determine how well each page       performs overall based on aggregate user demographics and traffic patterns       to those pages. This helps us continue to build a better Service for you; </li>
        <li>To fulfill your requests for       certain products and services, such as sending out electronic newsletters       and enabling you to participate in paid services, polls, contests, and       message boards; </li>

These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
