<b>4. <u><a name="legalbasisforprocessingpersonalinformation(eeavisitorsonly)"></a>LEGAL BASIS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL INFORMATION (EEA VISITORS ONLY)</u></b><br /><br />

If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it.  <br><br>
However, we will normally collect personal information from you only (i) where we need the personal information to perform a contract with you, (ii) where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your rights, or (iii) where we have your consent to do so.  In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal information from you or may otherwise need the personal information to protect your vital interests or those of another person.<br><br>
If we ask you to provide personal information to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contact with you, we will make this clear at the relevant time and advise you whether the provision of your personal information is mandatory or not (as well as of the possible consequences if you do not provide your personal information).  <br><br>
If we collect and use your personal information in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third party), this interest will normally be to operate our Sites and communicate with you as necessary to provide our services to you and for our legitimate commercial interests, for instance, when responding to your queries, improving our Sites, undertaking marketing, or for the purposes of detecting or preventing illegal activities.  We may have other legitimate interests and if appropriate   we will make clear to you at the relevant time what those legitimate interests are.<br><br>
If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your personal information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="#contactus"><u>Contact Us</u></a>” heading below .<br><br>

<b>7. <u><a name="internationaldatatransfers"></a>INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</u></b><br /><br />

Your personal information may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country in which you are resident.  These countries may have data protection laws that are different to the laws of your country (and, in some cases, may not be as protective).<br /><br />

Specifically, our website servers are located in the USA, and our group companies and third party service providers and partners operate around the world.  This means that when we collect your personal information we may process it in any of these countries.<br /><br />

However, we have taken appropriate safeguards to require that your personal information will remain protected in accordance with this Notice. These include implementing an intra-group data transfer agreement incorporating the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses for transfers of personal information between our group companies, which require all group companies to protect personal information they process from the EEA in accordance with European Union data protection law.  A copy of our intra-group data transfer agreement can be provided upon request.<br /><br />

Where required by applicable data protection law, we have implemented similar appropriate safeguards with our third party service providers and partners and further details can be provided upon request.<br /><br />



<b>8. <u><a name="dataretention"></a>DATA RETENTION</u></b><br /><br />
We retain personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).  <br><br>

When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.  <br /><br>


<b>9. <u><a name="yourdataprotectionrights"></a>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS</u></b><br /><br />

  <li>In addition, you can object to processing of your personal information, ask us to restrict processing of your personal information or request portability of your personal information. Again, you can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided under the “<a href="#contactus"><u style=" font-family:'UniversLTW01-45Light'; text-transform: lowercase;">Contact Us</u></a>” heading below .</li>
     
     <li>You have the right to opt-out of marketing communications we send you at any time.  You can exercise this right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” or “opt-out” link in the marketing e-mails we send you, or by logging into your account and managing your email preferences</li>
     
     <li>Similarly, if we have collected and process your personal information with your consent, then you can withdraw your consent at any time.  Withdrawing your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing we conducted prior to your withdrawal, nor will it affect processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</li>
     <li>You have the right to complain to a data protection authority about our collection and use of your personal information.  For more information, please contact your local data protection authority. </li>
