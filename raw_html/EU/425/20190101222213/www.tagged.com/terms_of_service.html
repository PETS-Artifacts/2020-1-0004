Except, however, that if the arbitrator in such action finds that either the substance of your dispute against the Company or the relief you are seeking in the arbitration is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees in such action shall be governed by the AAA Rules.

<h3 id="policy_covers">I. What This Privacy Policy Covers</h3>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how our mobile applications, websites and
products collect, store, use, and share your personal information. It
also describes how you can control and protect your privacy on our
Services.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy does <em>not</em> apply to the practices of
companies that we do not own or control, such as companies that
advertise on our Services. For example, companies that advertise on our
Services may tag your device or computer with cookies. We do not control
these third party cookies and their privacy policies may differ from
ours.</p>

<h3 id="controlling_protecting_privacy">II. Controlling and Protecting Your Privacy</h3>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Personal Safety</strong>. After getting to know someone online, you may
choose to meet him or her in-person. If so, be careful and use
common sense. Never meet someone in private for the first time;
choose a public place, and take a friend. For more information about
staying safe, please visit <a href="http://socialsafety.org/">www.socialsafety.org</a>, a public service
website from The Meet Group, Inc.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Account Settings.</strong> You can change your account settings at any
time. You should review these settings regularly.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deleting Your Account.</strong> You can edit or delete information that
you upload to our Services and you can delete your account, but you
cannot recall or delete information that others have copied. When
you delete your account, some or all of your information may remain
on our servers, but you will not be able to access it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deleting Your Information and Content.</strong> You can request us to
delete your posted information and content. To do so, send an email
to <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;r&#116;&#x40;&#116;&#x68;e&#109;&#x65;&#101;&#x74;&#x67;&#114;&#x6f;&#117;&#112;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;m">&#115;&#117;&#x70;&#112;&#x6f;r&#116;&#x40;&#116;&#x68;e&#109;&#x65;&#101;&#x74;&#x67;&#114;&#x6f;&#117;&#112;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;m</a> from the email address associated with
your account, requesting deletion.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Location Information</strong>. We collect your location when you first
register with our Services and each time you log in on a mobile
device. You can control whether other users see your location after
initial log in through your operating system's settings. We may
still use your location (such as for security or advertising
purposes) even if you choose not to display it to other users.</p>

<p>We do not "track" your location, but we do collect location
information from your device or browser when you log in or use our
Services, such as when you visit a particular feature that uses
location. In addition, as with most location-enabled applications, we
and our third-party partners may access your location any time your
device is on, whether or not you are logged-in to our Services. But we
do not share your precise location with other users; if you are under
the age of 18, we do not describe your location more specifically than
your city and state and "within one mile" of other users.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Password</strong>. Store your password in a safe place, and do not share
it with anyone. If you think someone has your password, change it
immediately.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Posting Information</strong>. Posting personal information on public
areas of our Services will make it publicly available. The personal
information you post or share with others may in turn be shared by
them with still other users and it may also show up when someone
uses a public search engine (even if that person is not a user of
our Services). [Do not post personal information in public areas of
our Services that you want to keep private]{.underline}.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Third Parties</strong>. We are not responsible for (and don't have any
control over) the privacy policies of third party websites, apps and
ad servers. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each
and every website and app you visit.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Opting Out of Receiving Cookies.</strong> You may set your browser to
block some or all cookies. However, our Services might not fully
function if you disable cookies. If you use multiple devices,
browsers or computers, you will need to opt out of receiving cookies
on each one. Also, if you change devices or computers you will need
to repeat this opt-out process. You may also be able to opt-out of
receiving cookies from some advertisers.</p>

information to our advertising partners as described in this Privacy
Policy.</p></li>
