                To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you.
                <b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.

                native advertising disclosures, endorsements, privacy, and data security. All Ad’s must be fair, truthful, and clearly distinguishable from editorial
                content. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring all Ads and related claims are adequately substantiated. Further, Advertisers must adhere to ThoughtCo’s Prohibited Content Guidelines and Additional Standards set forth below, which are incorporated into and made a part of these Guidelines.

                the right to remove, without notice, any Ads that do not meet these Guidelines, regardless of whether the Ad was previously accepted by ThoughtCo.

                    <b>Compatibility.</b>
                    Ads must function uniformly on both Apple and PC formats, as well as all major Internet browsers.

                <li>
                    <b>Independence.</b>
                    Ads may not appear to compromise or influence ThoughtCo’s editorial independence from Advertisers.

                    <b>Endorsements.</b>

                <li>
                    <b>Landing Pages.</b>
                    Landing pages associated with Ads must correspond to the Ad's "call to action" and not engage in “bait and switch”.

                    <b>Proprietary Rights.</b>

                    <b>Data Collection/Use.</b>
                    Ads may not include open-box forms to register users or collect any data. Ads may not collect and sell or license any data or mailing lists regarding ThoughtCo users without ThoughtCo's express permission. Advertisers may not collect any personally identifiable information from ThoughtCo users or place any cookies, applets or other similar files — if those files transmit any personally identifiable information to Advertisers — on desktop computers or
