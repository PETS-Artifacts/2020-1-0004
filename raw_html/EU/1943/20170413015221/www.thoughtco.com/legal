                At ThoughtCo, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. In this policy, we describe our privacy practices
                with regard to information we collect through ThoughtCo.com and affiliated sites and email properties (collectively, the “Site”) to help you make informed decisions about how you share
                information when you visit or use the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on ThoughtCo:</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may collect information, including personally identifiable information, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you
                may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our
                newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate in forums or discussions or other Interactive Services on the Site. Please be
                aware that information you post may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive or personal information that you would not want to be available to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit ThoughtCo</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners and vendors may automatically collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web
                beacons, and other data collecting and tracking technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of
                your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique
                device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site), and other details that generally are not
                considered personally identifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cookies</b>
                are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies (such
                as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit
                <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. See the section below regarding <a href="#your-choices">Your choices</a> to learn more
                about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use
                cookies to enhance their functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) and other tracking mechanisms on pages on the Site, in videos, or in emails we send to you.
                <b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of
                purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are
                actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors
                to the Site. <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Click here to learn more about Google Analytics and how you may opt out.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b>
                Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is no
                consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” in this context. Like many other websites, ThoughtCo.com is not configured to
                respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">Click here to learn more about "do not track" signals.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like” buttons)
                also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy
                policies or notices of those providers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Information We Receive From Other Sources</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may supplement the information we collect with information from outside sources in order to learn more about our users, to better tailor the content and offers we make available to you, and for other lawful business purposes. We may receive this information about you from third parties, including without limitation data resellers and advertisers. We may combine the information we receive from those other (online and offline) sources with information we collect through the Site.
            </p>
            <p>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>
                These advertising guidelines (“Guidelines”) set forth standards that govern the placement and display of advertisements and sponsored content (collectively,
                “Ads”) by any advertiser, agency, or advertising technology platform (collectively, “Advertisers”). Advertisers must adhere to these Guidelines when placing
                Ads, including Ads purchased under the AAAA/IAB Standard Terms and Conditions, on websites or mobile properties owned or controlled by About, Inc.,
                including ThoughtCo.com (collectively, “ThoughtCo”).
            </p>
            <p>
                These Guidelines are intended to provide general parameters for Advertisers in connection with Ad creative and content served on ThoughtCo. They are not
                exhaustive and do not address every situation or issue that may arise in the course of business. Accordingly, these Guidelines are subject to change from
                time to time in ThoughtCo’s sole and absolute discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Advertisers are responsible for understanding and complying with all applicable laws and regulations, including FTC guidelines regarding advertising,
                native advertising disclosures, endorsements, privacy, and data security. All Ad’s must be fair, truthful, and clearly distinguishable from editorial
                content. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring all Ads and related claims are adequately substantiated. Further, Advertisers must adhere to ThoughtCo’s Prohibited Content Guidelines and Additional Standards set forth below, which are incorporated into and made a part of these Guidelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ads served through networks or exchanges are reviewed on a regular basis and, in addition to any other remedies ThoughtCo may have, ThoughtCo reserves
                the right to remove, without notice, any Ads that do not meet these Guidelines, regardless of whether the Ad was previously accepted by ThoughtCo.
