advertising (also known as targeted or personalized advertising or ads) is

ads may consist of text ads, images, animations or videos and may be displayed
to you based on various factors, including the context of the site or app in
which they appear (e.g., sport or travel section), information you provided to
the operator of the site or app (e.g., when you created an account), your
activities on the site or app (e.g., pages viewed, searches performed or ads
clicked), and information such as your demographic, interests and household

interest-based ads.  These automated
means vary depending on the Digital Services and include technologies such as
