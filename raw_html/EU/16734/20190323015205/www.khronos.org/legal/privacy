<h2>HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

Our vendors perform services such as accounting, data backups, hosting services, analytics, and marketing communications.</p>

<h2>PUBLIC INFORMATION ON KHRONOS</h2>

<p>Areas of our Websites are public-facing. If your Personal Information is public-facing, third parties may access and use it, such as by viewing your profile, repositories, forum content or mailing lists. We do not sell that information. However, we do allow third parties, such as research organizations or archives, to compile public-facing information. Other third parties, such as data brokers, have been known to scrape our Websites and compile data as well.</p>

<p>Your Personal Information, associated with your content, could be gathered by third parties in these compilations of Khronos data. If you do not want your Personal Information to appear in third-parties' compilations of Khronos data, please do not use the products or services on our Websites which are publicly available and be sure to configure your email address to be private in your user profile where permissible and in your git commit settings.</p>

<h2>INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT</h2>

<p>Khronos does not intentionally collect sensitive Personal Information, such as social security numbers, genetic data, health information, or religious information. Although Khronos does not request or intentionally collect any sensitive Personal Information, we realize that users might store this kind of information in a forum, mailing list, issue tracker or repository. If you store any sensitive Personal Information on Khronos' servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the United States.</p>

<p>Khronos does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from or about children under 13. If it is discovered that any information from a child under 13 is collected in violation of this policy, such information will be removed immediately. If you believe our Websites have information from or about anyone under 13, please <a href="#contact-us">contact our information privacy manager</a>.</p>

<h2>COOKIES AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Khronos uses cookies to make interactions with our service easy and meaningful. We use cookies to keep you logged in, remember your preferences, and provide information for future development of our Websites. We also use cookies to identify a device, for security reasons. By using our Websites, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your computer or device. If you disable your browser or device's ability to accept cookies, you will not be able to log in or use Khronos Websites.</p>

<p><strong>Tracking and analytics</strong></p>

<p>We use a few third-party analytics and service providers to help us evaluate our users' use of our Websites; compile statistical reports on activity; and improve our content and website performance. We only use these third-party analytics providers on certain areas of our website, and all of them have signed data protection agreements with us that limit the type of Personal Information they can collect and the purpose for which they can process the information. In addition, we use our own internal analytics software to provide features and improve our content and performance.</p>

<p>We do not currently respond to your browser's Do Not Track signal, and we do not permit third parties other than our analytics and service providers to track users' activity over time on our Websites and Communications. We do not track your online browsing activity on other online services over time.</p>

<h2>DATA SECURITY  </h2>

<p>Khronos takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect users' information from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction; maintain data accuracy; and help ensure the appropriate use of user information.</p>

<p>Transmission of data on Khronos websites is encrypted using SSH, HTTPS, and SSL/TLS. While our data is not encrypted at rest, when data is stored for backups with a third-party storage provider, it is encrypted.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data breach and we will act promptly to mitigate the impact of a breach, and we will notify any affected users without undue delay. No method of transmission, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>DATA RETENTION AND DELETION</h2>

<p>We will only retain your Personal Information where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so, including to provide you with a service you have requested or to comply with applicable legal, tax, or accounting requirements.</p>

<p>When there is no longer an ongoing legitimate business need to process your Personal Information, we will either delete or anonymize it. If this is not possible (for example, because your Personal Information has been stored in backup archives), we will securely store your Personal Information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>After an account has been deleted, certain data, such as contributions to others' repositories and comments in others' issues and in mailing lists, will remain. The email address you have supplied via your Git, Gitlab, Subversion and Bugzilla (“developer tools”) commit settings will always be associated with your contributions. If you chose to make your email address private, you should also update your Developer Tools settings. We are unable to change or delete data in the Developer Tools history but we do enable you to control what information you contribute.</p>

<h2>MANAGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>When you are signed in to one of our websites, you are able to review and update your information for that Website. For example, Member, Adopter or Advisor  profile, forums and wikis are all designed to help you manage the content you've posted on our websites. If you need assistance in updating your information on any of our Websites, please <a href="#contact-us">contact our information privacy manager</a>.</p>

<h2>YOUR DATA PROTECTION RIGHTS  </h2>

<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your Personal Information.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Request access</strong> to your Personal Information, which allows you to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to confirm that we are lawfully processing it. </li>
<li><strong>Request correction</strong> of any incomplete or inaccurate Personal Information that we hold about you. We may need to verify the accuracy of the new information you provide to us.</li>
<li><strong>Request erasure</strong> of your Personal Information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your Personal Information where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your Personal Information to comply with local law. Note, however, that if there are specific legal reasons that prevent us from being able to comply with your request, we will provide those to you at the time of your request.</li>
<li><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your Personal Information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) if you feel that you have specific reasons to object to processing for that interest as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may show that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
<li><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your Personal Information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your Personal Information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your Personal Information to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your Personal Information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
<li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your Personal Information. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.</li>
<li><strong>California privacy rights</strong> Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (also known as S.B. 27), if you are a California resident and your business relationship with Khronos is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may request, up to once a year, certain data regarding Khronos' disclosure, if any, of Personal Information to third parties for the third-parties' direct marketing purposes.</li>
</ul>
