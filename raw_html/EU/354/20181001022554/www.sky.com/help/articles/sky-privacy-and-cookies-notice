This includes, where the contract requires it, for example: providing you with account management functionality (such as to update contact information), customer support (including diagnostics and trouble-shooting), call screening and blocking, and tailored and personalised recommendations.</p>
<p>In order to enter into loan agreements with you, we obtain personal data about you from credit reference agencies. We then take automated decisions using that personal data about whether or not to enter into the loan agreement with you. This decision is influenced by your credit history and, depending on the outcome of this automated decision making process, we may not enter into the loan agreement with you. If you would like us to review decisions taken about you as part of this process, please contact us as set out below. </p>
<p>In addition, we also use your personal data for the following legitimate business purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing our products and services and traffic across our network. For example, Sky uses your information to facilitate the operation of its network by choosing the most efficient route to transmit your requests for a communications service through the various parts of its network of equipment and systems. This information is held securely within restricted areas, accessible only by authorised personnel and in accordance with our data retention, deletion and acceptable use policies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improving our content, products, services and customer experiences by  monitoring your use of our products and services and working with our suppliers to improve the products and services we offer, and develop new content, products and services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitoring, recording, storing and using customer service communications we have with you. This helps us to improve the quality of our customer service, to confirm any instructions you give us, to create a customer profile to have better conversations and/or for training, development and to meet our legal and regulatory responsibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Showing adverts to the people most likely to be interested in the products and services being promoted. To do this, we create a profile about you which we use to define groups of audiences to whom we send adverts, based on factors like interests, age, location and more. As part of showing these adverts, we also carry out quality and frequency checks, such as whether adverts were displayed correctly and how often particular adverts have been shown. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For market research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Protecting or enforcing our rights or the rights of any third party such as by analysing activity on our network to help block unauthorised or illegitimate content, publication of, or access to it.</p>

We will never share your name, physical address or phone numbers with any of our trusted partners. </p>
<p>We perform due diligence before a company becomes a trusted partner and is able to handle your data in a secure and responsible manner. This processing is based on your acceptance of cookies on our website and your Sky ID preferences.  The categories of partner that we work with include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advertising agencies and advertisers, which  buy advertising on Sky’s
online and digital platforms so they can deliver targeted and
tailored advertising and can measure which advertisements are clicked
and other such results associated with displaying such
advertisements; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising platforms (e.g. Google, Rubicon, Unruly and Outbrain)
which help Sky to deliver tailored and targeted advertising across
Sky’s online and digital platforms. These advertising platforms
enable Sky to offer its advertising space and manage use of that
advertising space efficiently.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Where our partners are based outside of the European Economic Area, we work with these partners to make sure personal data is processed only if appropriate measures and controls are in place to protect your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations and regulatory guidance.

<ul>
<li>
<p>To provide you with more relevant advertising and tailored offers
(including discounts). Sky can serve different ads to groups of
people and to different Sky households, customers or individuals
within a household watching the same programme or service. We use the
information you have provided to us or information we have collected
about you and your household to tailor the adverts you receive and
make them more relevant, by playing an advert on your TV or device
when the relevant audience may be most likely to be watching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To send you direct marketing. This may include communications by
post, telephone, SMS, email or other electronic means, using the
contact details you have provided, about us and our content products
and services, events and special offers, including, for a reasonable
time after you have ceased to be a customer of ours (see further

They make using devices and accessing online information much smoother and affect lots of the useful features of websites. There are many different uses for cookies, but they fall into four main groups.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies that are needed to provide the content, product or service you have asked for</strong></p>
<p>Some cookies are essential to help your devices download or stream the information, or so you can move around websites and use their features. Without these cookies, content, products or services you&#x27;ve asked for can&#x27;t be provided.  </p>
<p>Here are some examples of essential cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Positioning information on a smartphone screen, tablet device or other screen so that you can see the website and use its functionality.</li>
<li>Keeping you logged in during your visit or enabling you to stream content. Without cookies, you might have to log in on every website you visit, or repeatedly adjust your volume and viewing settings.</li>
<li>When you add something to the online shopping basket, cookies make sure it&#x27;s still there when you get to the checkout.</li>
<li>Some are session cookies which make it possible to navigate through the website smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Improving your browsing experience</strong></p>
<p>Cookies allow the application or website to remember choices you make, such as your language or region, and they provide improved features.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of some of the ways that cookies are used to improve your experience on our applications and websites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remembering your preferences and settings, including marketing preferences, such as choosing whether you wish to receive marketing information.</li>
<li>Remembering if you&#x27;ve filled in a survey, so you&#x27;re not asked to do it again.</li>
<li>Remembering if you&#x27;ve been to the application or website before.</li>
<li>Restricting the number of times you&#x27;re shown a particular advertisement. This is sometimes called &#x27;frequency capping&#x27;.</li>
<li>Showing you information that&#x27;s relevant to content, products or services that you receive.</li>
<li>Giving you access to content provided by social-media sites like Facebook or Twitter.</li>
<li>Showing &#x27;related article&#x27; links that are relevant to the information you&#x27;re looking at.</li>
<li>Remembering an application or website you&#x27;ve entered, such as weather forecasts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Analytics</strong></p>
<p>We like to keep track of what websites, information and links are popular and which ones don&#x27;t get used so much, to help us keep our information relevant and up to date. It&#x27;s also very useful to be able to identify trends of how people navigate (find their way through) our information and when and where &#x27;error messages&#x27; may originate.</p>
<p>This group of cookies, often called &#x27;analytics cookies&#x27;, are used to gather this information. The information collected is grouped with the information from everyone else’s cookies. We can then see the overall patterns of usage rather than any one person’s activity. Analytics cookies are used to improve how an application, a website and its pages work.</p>
<p>Our applications, web locations, websites and communications you get from us contain small invisible images known as &#x27;web beacons&#x27; or &#x27; pixels&#x27;. These are used to manage the interaction between you and the online information or email and allow us to assess the effectiveness of the communication.</p>
<p><strong>Affiliate cookies</strong></p>
<p>We use &#x27;affiliate&#x27; cookies. Some of our web based information will contain promotional links to other companies’ sites. If you follow one of these links and then register with or buy something from that other site, a cookie is used to tell the other site that you came from one of our sites. That other site may then pay us a small amount for the successful referral. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.iab-performance-marketing-explained.net/">Internet Advertising Bureau&#x27;s</a> guide about how affiliate marketing works.  Note that when you visit those other companies’ sites, they will have their own privacy notices which set out what personal data they collect and how they will use it.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div><div class="c-accordion__section" data-test-id="toolkit-accordion-section"><button type="button" id="accordion-repeater-header-2" class="c-accordion__label" aria-controls="accordion-repeater-panel-2" aria-expanded="false">How we show advertising and marketing that is relevant to your interests</button><article id="accordion-repeater-panel-2" class="c-accordion__content c-accordion__content--animated" style="height:0;visibility:hidden" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion-repeater-header-2"><div class="c-accordion__inner"><div class="o-layout"><div class="o-layout__item"><div><p>We sell space on some of our websites, mobile sites and apps to advertisers. The resulting adverts often contain cookies and related technology that is placed by trusted third party partners who use the browsing information collected from these cookies to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict the number of times you see the same ad (frequency capping) and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Help show other advertisements that are relevant to you while you&#x27;re accessing our information. This information about your browsing activity may be grouped with information about what is being accessed by other users, into interest groups, and then used to show you advertisements based on those interests. This is often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes our websites contain advertisements for our own Sky products. These advertisements use cookies in the same way as described above.  We may also use cookies and related technology on third party websites, mobile sites and apps to show you OBA ads based on data collected by those cookies.</p></div></div></div></div></article></div><div class="c-accordion__section" data-test-id="toolkit-accordion-section"><button type="button" id="accordion-repeater-header-3" class="c-accordion__label" aria-controls="accordion-repeater-panel-3" aria-expanded="false">Cookies explained</button><article id="accordion-repeater-panel-3" class="c-accordion__content c-accordion__content--animated" style="height:0;visibility:hidden" role="region" aria-labelledby="accordion-repeater-header-3"><div class="c-accordion__inner"><div class="o-layout"><div class="o-layout__item"><div><p>If you want to know about data collected by third parties when you click on their adverts, you should check their privacy notices to find out what they collect, how they process it and what they use it for.</p>

<p>Virtually all modern browsers allow you to see what cookies you&#x27;ve got, and to clear them individually or clear all of them. To find out how to do this, go to <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">aboutcookies.org</a>, which contains comprehensive information on how to do this on a wide variety of desktop browsers.</p>
<p><strong>How can I choose not to receive Online Behavioural Advertising and other tracking cookies?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the controls available on your computer, there are other ways of choosing not to receive Online Behavioural Advertising and other tracking cookies.</p>
<p>Please note that most of these choices work by setting a cookie that overrides the behavioural advertising cookie. If you clear all your cookies, you will also clear these opt-out cookies, therefore changing your preferences. In this instance you would need to choose again.</p>
