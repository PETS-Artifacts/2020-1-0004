	Hello members of SAO-RPG! <br> <br>
	I'm sure most of you (if not some) have noticed or heard changes were made to the staff team. If you are applying to staff, you may have noticed that the application process has recently changed. This has all happened because of a reformation of the staff team and the way it operates. The staff now has separate teams for development. These teams are: Floor Creation Team [Floors, Quests/Events, Bosses], Systems &amp; Clarifications Team, and Player Support Team. <br> <br>
	"Who is on these teams?" Well the answer to that lies below!
 


	Floor Team
 




	Systems &amp; Clarifications Team
 




	Player Support Team
 




	* - Denotes Team Lead <br> <br>
	We also have a team to work on and develop the current systems but that team will search for its members and is not allowed to be applied to. <br> <br>
	Now you may be asking, "Shark, how does one apply to the Staff Team?" And I have but 1 simple answer! <br>Go read this thread and it may answer all your questions! <br> <br>
	If you have any more questions, send me a PM and I will answer your questions about staff. (Only the format of teams and/or the application process)

	&lt;&lt;2.5.0 Patch Notes&gt;&gt;
 



		Main Guide:

		

				The main rules/tutorial section has been rewritten.
			 
		
 
	
		Resources:
		

				A Resources section has been added. This contains reference material such as the SP/Level chart, Skills list, Enhancement list, individual profession stats, and a new FAQ.
			 
		
 


	General Rule Changes:
 



		Word count requirement in Merchants &amp; Shops section has been reduced to 100 from 150.
	 
	
		Col logs are no longer required to include in journals. The Banker system will be used to track currency/materials going forward.
	 
	
		New characters and Rebirth characters may choose a Starter Package containing a variety of basic equipment, col, materials, and/or potions.
	 
	
		NK/KE tags have been removed.
	 
	
		The table for SP gain based on the number of players in a thread has been removed. SP gain is now issued at 1 SP per 3 posts, up to the number of completed pages. (e.g. 3 SP for three pages, requires at least 9 posts)
	 
	
		A Skill Refunding System has been added. Players may now pay a col cost to remove known skills and receive a refund of the invested SP.
	 
	
		Rules on vanity items have been clarified.
	 
	
		Health regeneration outside of combat has been adjusted to (10 * Tier) per post.
	 
	
		Stealth and Stealth Detection no longer have a base rating for players. Both now use a LD roll plus a Stealth Rating/Stealth Detection modifier. NPCs and monsters still utilize a base rating (10 as a baseline for player-created mobs).
	 
	
		'Using cover' no longer adds to Stealth Rating. Low light or darkness conditions grant a +1 to Stealth Rating, down from +2.
	 
	
		Switch has been added as a game mechanic (no longer a skill). Players may call for a Switch when landing a successful attack. If the Switching player also lands an attack, a Switch is performed and the two players may immediately swap hate values.
	 
	
		Players are required to post their level, stats, equipment, skills, etc., in their first post in a thread. This should be a snapshot of your character and should not be changed after the initial post. Players are still allowed to declare their characters at a lower level or with fewer items than what they currently have, but may not claim items that have not been approved or were obtained in an unlocked thread.
	 
	
		Turn order rules have been modified slightly to reflect the leniency of Boss Raid combat. Players may post in any order so long as each player and the enemy has gotten one action in a single round.
	 
	
		Outside of Boss Raids, parties may have a maximum of 4 players. Combat with more than 4 players should follow a Group order similar to boss raids.
	 
	
		When fighting multiple enemies, players must now make individual rolls for each mob. This applies to both making attacks against multiple enemies and multiple enemies making attacks. One roll no longer applies to/for all targets.
	 
	
		The Running Away mechanic has been updated. Running away from combat now uses a LD roll with a set of situational modifiers.
	 
	
		The col/material values and frequency in the loot table have been adjusted.
	 
	
		Labyrinth searching rules have been adjusted. The map fragment system has been removed. Bonus rewards for scouting and defeating the field boss have been adjusted.
	 
	
		Housing and Guild Halls have been completely revamped.
	 
	
		PvP rules have been adjusted. Players must make an initiative roll when engaging in combat with other players.
	 
	
		The extended Player Killing rules/restrictions have been removed.
	 
	
		Rules on player cursor colors have been expanded. There is now a strike system for criminal infractions that would cause a player's cursor to turn orange. Killing a green player outside of a duel now results in a permanent orange cursor.
	 
	
		An NPC Guard mechanic has been added. Orange players may now enter safe zones, but must stealth/run from guards in certain safe zones. NPC guards have a Stealth Detection rating equal to (Floor / 3), rounded down.
	 
	
		Added more detail to character death rules.
	 
	
		The RGQ system has been removed.
	 


	Crafting Changes:
 



		Fishing as a profession has been removed. It is now a skill.
	 
	
		The CD result chart has been adjusted across all professions (except Merchant).
		

				Good and Bad quality items have been removed from the CD result chart.
			 
			
				Salvage chances have been adjusted. Alchemists now have a chance to salvage one or both materials when attempting to craft crystals.
			 
		
 
	
		Crafting Die tools no longer have an effect. Consumables, familiars, housing, and some items still provide EXP and Crafting Attempt bonuses.
	 
	
		The process of crafting Feasts has changed slightly. Cooks may now take 3 identical food items and spend two materials to combine them into a Feast. A Feast can be used in a thread to provide that enhancement to up to six players.
	 
	
		Artisan craftable item types have been modified (Trinkets, Jewelry, Sculptures). The buffs they can provide are largely unchanged.
	 
	
		Alchemist craftable item types have been modified (Salves, Potions, Crystals). The buffs they can provide are largely unchanged.

				«Witch of the West and the Three Treasures: T.M.H &amp; S.B.»
			 
			
				«Witch of the West and the Three Treasures: T.L.C.»
			 
			
				«Witch of the West and the Three Treasures
			 
			
				«The Falling of Tagas»
			 
		
 


	Housing Changes:

		Purchasing a PK-accessible home (outside of a safe zone) has an additional cost.
	 
	
		Buffs from Guild Halls/Player Housing now comes from the type of room, rather than furniture.
	 
	
		Certain rooms for Player Housing have upgrades.
