	Hello members of SAO-RPG! <br> <br>
	I'm sure most of you (if not some) have noticed or heard changes were made to the staff team. If you are applying to staff, you may have noticed that the application process has recently changed. This has all happened because of a reformation of the staff team and the way it operates. The staff now has separate teams for development. These teams are: Floor Creation Team [Floors, Quests/Events, Bosses], Systems &amp; Clarifications Team, and Player Support Team. <br> <br>
	"Who is on these teams?" Well the answer to that lies below!
 


	Floor Team
 




	Systems &amp; Clarifications Team
 




	Player Support Team
 




	 <br>Minecraft Development Team
 




	 <br>
	* - Denotes Team Lead <br> <br>
	We also have a team to work on and develop the current systems but that team will search for its members and is not allowed to be applied to. <br> <br>
	Now you may be asking, "Shark, how does one apply to the Staff Team?" And I have but 1 simple answer! <br>Go read this thread and it may answer all your questions! <br> <br>
	If you have any more questions, send me a PM and I will answer your questions about staff. (Only the format of teams and/or the application process)

	&lt;&lt;Crafting and Adventuring Update&gt;&gt; <br>SAO-RPG Patch 2.5.1
 


	Timeline Update!
 


	Please note that the following is out of character knowledge. <br>
	Time progresses at a different rate in the game than in our characters' real lives. As of November 6, 2017 (OOC real time), characters should have the perception that 2 years have passed since the game's launch. This will continue to roughly mirror the passage of real time until the game's completion. The note that the perception of time is different in-game is to allow the idea that a set amount of time has passed in the real world (likely 2 years) upon the game's completion, regardless of how long it takes for the site to clear all 100 floors.
 


	We hope to release more changes soon that will streamline boss fights and floor clearing, as well as help new players establish themselves despite the time gap, but hopefully this timeline serves as a helpful tool for players throughout the rest of our time spent clearing the game.
 


	Site Changes:
 



		A post count feature has been added to the site. The number of each post (i.e. #1) now displays on the top-right, beside the "Link Post" feature.
	 


	General Rule Changes:
 



		Word count requirement for posts in which a player is stunned or paralyzed has been reduced to 100 from 150.
	 
	
		PvP and Player Killing Rules have been updated:
		

				No player can kill another without OOC permission.
			 
			
				The rule for initiative rolls on Unauthorized Combat have been removed.
			 
			
				The NPC Guard mechanic has been removed.
			 
		
 
	
		Characters Level 5 and under are eligible to claim a New Character Bundle, regardless of when their journal was created.
	 
	
		Unidentified items, when obtained in a thread, no longer have to be declared until they are identified by a Merchant. For example, a weapon drop can be claimed from a locked thread as an Unidentified T1 Weapon, rather than an Unidentified T1 2H Assault Spear. When identifying an item, the Merchant should then specify the item type in their roll(s). To clarify, items leaving locked threads should be specified according to the loot tables as: Weapon, Shield, Armor, Consumable.
	 
	
		The Loot Table has been slightly adjusted, mainly to increase the number of consumables dropped from monsters.
	 


	Crafting Changes: <br>A note to all crafters: Be sure you are transferring your materials (col for Merchants) to the @Banker account when crafting.
 



		The &lt;&lt;Earning a Living&gt;&gt; quest has been updated, and is now profession-specific.
	 
	
		Three new crafting/gathering-based quests have been added: &lt;&lt;Nature's Treasure&gt;&gt;, &lt;&lt;Witch of the West&gt;&gt;, and &lt;&lt;Challenge of Olympus&gt;&gt;.
	 
	
		+CD bonuses for crafting have been reintroduced. These can be obtained through the new quests &lt;&lt;Challenge of Olympus&gt;&gt; &amp; &lt;&lt;Witch of the West&gt;&gt;.
	 
	
		Merchants:
		

				The chance to successfully identify a unique enhancement now scales with Merchant Rank.
			 
			
				The identification chart for Consumables has been reworked. The process of identifying consumables has changed.
			 
			
				Identification prices have been reduced by 20%.
			 
			
				General stock items have been adjusted. Blank Recording Crystals have been removed, and five new items have been added: Glow Stone, Single/Double Tents, Spyglass, and Water Canister.
			 
		
 
	
		Alchemists/Cooks:
		

				Enhancement lists for both professions have been reworked.
			 
			
				Successful crafts now have a chance to yield additional items. The Crafting Die Result charts have been updated.
			 
		
 
	
		Performers:
		

				Song types have been adjusted.
			 
			
				Enhancement list has been reworked.
			 
			
				Successful crafts now have a chance to become 'Masterpieces'. This allows the craft to be submitted for evaluation with an additional effect.
