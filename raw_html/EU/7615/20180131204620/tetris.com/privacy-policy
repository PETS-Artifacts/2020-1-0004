<p><strong>What are "cookies"?</strong></p>
<p>Most Internet sites, including ours, collect data about visitors through the use of "cookies". Cookies are small software programs that help sites recognize repeat visitors by assigning a random number to each desktop for tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. Cookies may be used to "connect" your computer to information stored in a separate location. At Tetris.com, we use cookies to connect your computer with the information we store for you in our database. Some examples of this information include items added to your shopping cart and user specific information on pages accessed and previous visits to our site. Your information is stored in a safe and secure database. Through cookies we may also: alert you to new products that we think might be of interest to you when you return to our site; record past activity at our site in order to provide you better service when you return to our site; or, customize web page content based on your browser type or other information that you send us. We do not use cookies to store any of your personal or financial information on your computer. The Tetris Company recognizes that you have a choice to refuse cookies. However, if you wish to purchase from our site, you must accept cookies so that we can securely process your order. Cookies keep track of the items that you order during your shopping session so that when you're ready to check out, all of the items you've placed in your shopping cart will be there and ready for purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Third Party Advertising Companies</strong></p>
<p>We use third party advertising companies to serve ads on our sites, which may, directly or indirectly, collect or use information about your visits to our sites to display advertisements more tailored to your interests.&nbsp; If you wish to know more about this practice or would like to know more about your options, you can visit the Network Advertising Initiative (&ldquo;NAI&rdquo;) website: <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a>.&nbsp; The NAI is a cooperative of online advertising companies who are committed to responsible practices and consumer protection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do you know your information is secure?</strong></p>

We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving your information on our sites. If you do not see one of these icons, please contact your Internet service provider. When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information, we will redirect you to a secure server. We have appropriate security measures in place in our facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our sites so you can feel comfortable and secure. Please note that e-mail is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.</p>
