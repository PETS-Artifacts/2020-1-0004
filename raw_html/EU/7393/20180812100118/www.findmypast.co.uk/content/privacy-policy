<h3>2. Information we collect</h3>
<p><b>Information we collect about you</b></p>
<p>When you register on our website or place an order, we collect your name and email address. This allows us to process your registration, fulfil your order and send you important service messages.</p>

<p>We do collect some information from cookies, pixels and similar software which allows us to understand how you arrive on our websites, how you use and navigate around them, and how you interact with our email. This information is used to improve our services and communication. We obtain some information from Google Analytics and Facebook.

<p><b>Information you provide to us</b></p>
<p>If you create a family tree or create content on the website, we also collect that information, which may include personal information about you and other people (for example, names and birthdays of people in your family). You should ensure if you provide personal information about people in your family who are living and not deceased, that you have the consent from the relevant individual to include that personal information on the website.</p>
<p>We do not collect sensitive information (also known as special categories of information) about you except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this. Examples are adding your religious belief to a family tree. More details about the privacy of the family tree are available below.</p>
<h3>3. How we use the information</h3>
<p>We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including</p>
<ul>
<li>To manage the website (including your account);</li>
<li>To provide you with a free trial (if requested);</li>
<li>To process orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries.</li>
<li>For administration purposes. This means we may contact you regarding goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it, or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it.</li>
<li>To provide advanced website features to you and others.</li>
<li>We use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, and to personalise content and emails.</li>
<li>For analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered.</li>
<li>To improve your search results.</li>
<li>A certain amount of advertising is tailored to the individual based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as <a href="https://thedma.org/resources/compliance-resources/online-behavioral-advertising-compliance/ ">online behavioural advertising</a>.</li>
<li>We may show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, and Twitter). Some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers.</li>
<li>To conduct surveys with you (where you have consented to us contacting you for such purpose).</li>
<li>To provide personalised communications (more details below).</li>
<li>Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service.</li>
<li>We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Service messages</b></p>
<p>We send service emails to you to administer the service. Service emails include registration and payment confirmations and emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. We will also send you a service email if we make a fundamental change to the website, or to our terms &amp; conditions that we think we need to make you aware of, or to let you know important information about your account.</p>
<p><b>Marketing messages</b></p>
<p>We use your email address to update you on new products, services and subscription offers. We will only contact you with your consent. You are entitled to withhold this consent and refrain from receiving such communications by selecting the appropriate option on the web form that collects your details. You can also update these options at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@findmypast.com, by calling +44 (0)20 3326 6300 or by post to Findmypast, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us each time we send them to you.</p>
<h3>4. What if I don&rsquo;t provide some or all of the information requested?</h3>
<p>The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold, but the main impacts may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not be able to process or fully process your order.</li>
<li>We will not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.</li>
<li>We will not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.</li>
<li>We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.</li>
<li>We won&rsquo;t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that are not related to your interests.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>5. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?</h3>
<p>There are a number of grounds we process your data under. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractual &ndash; we need the information to perform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.</li>
<li>Legal &ndash; should we be legally required to contact you concerning a purchase or service.</li>
<li>Legitimate interest &ndash; this means the processing is in Findmypast&rsquo;s interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals.</li>
<li>Consent &ndash; where you have given us consent to market to you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>6. Information stored in your family tree</h3>
<p>Family names that are included in your family tree may be searchable by users of the website (and users of other websites) and may appear on internet searches. The information stored on your tree will not be viewable by other users unless you give explicit permission by making your tree public.</p>
<p>We provide you with privacy controls to manage your family tree and control who can see the information in it. You should familiarise yourself with how these controls work as you are responsible for using them to protect the information you have provided. We reserve the right (at our own discretion) to remove any personal data which you have included in your family tree about people who are living if we are alerted to the fact that this personal data was used without that person&rsquo;s permission.</p>
<p>If you become aware that your personal information has been included in somebody else's tree without your permission or is being misused in any other way on the website, please send an email to our Customer Support team support@findmypast.co.uk with details and we will investigate and, if necessary, remove this information.</p>
<h3>7. Record matching</h3>
<p>Findmypast uses record matching technologies to suggest possible matches between historical records on Findmypast and associated partner trees on Family Historian or Roots Magic.</p>
<p>Record matching on Findmypast automatically matches historical records for your family tree. These records are pulled from our vast records database Record matching will save you time with your research and allow you to make fascinating discoveries through historical records such as birth, marriage and death documents and census records. Our historical records are gathered from a number of key partners around the world. More information about our record partners is available on <a href="http://www.findmypast.co.uk/partners">Our Partners page</a>.</p>
<p>When record matching is enabled within partner sites such as Family Historian, Roots Magic, or other Desktop Software partners, information from small parts of your family tree is passed between the sites without you having to do anything, to a matching service on the Findmypast website. This information includes basic information such as names, dates and places associated with individuals and their close relatives. Findmypast uses this data to find accurate matches for relevant individuals. The matching service provides partner site users with suggested matches of ancestors&rsquo; birth, marriage, and death records. We will also provide matches for census records. As a Findmypast customer, you can then add these records to your tree. The service will match against living relatives.</p>
<p>Please note this information is not retained by Findmypast and is deleted automatically after matches are calculated and displayed to you. Only partner site users receive Findmypast hints. Findmypast users do not receive hints about trees on the partner site.</p>
<p>The partner site will show matches in its search window where matches are found. To find out more about these matches, follow the links provided and review them. You will then be able to accept or reject matches. Please note that some matches can be viewed and confirmed for free, while others require a Findmypast data subscription. In order to review these matches, you will need to subscribe to Findmypast and create an account.</p>
<p>The information passed to Findmypast is never used for any other purpose and will never be displayed, sold, licensed or used in any manner whatsoever. If you have any question or concerns, you can email support@findmypast.co.uk or call Customer Support on +44(0)20 3326 6300</p>
<h3>8. Sharing your information with third parties</h3>
<p>We may from time to time provide your personal information to third parties for the purposes of providing you with our services. These third-party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, and credit referencing providers. This is necessary for the performance of the contract. We do not keep a record of your credit or debit card details in our systems. Our payment processors do not decide what is done with your data and only process it on our behalf. These third parties may be located outside the European Economic Area; however, we only use providers that provide adequate protection for your information at all times.</p>
<p>When transferring and storing any personal information outside the EEA we only do so under one of the legally recognised transfer mechanisms for ensuring the data is safeguarded. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The country in question has been deemed safe for data transfer by the European Commission. Also known as an adequacy finding.</li>
<li>The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.</li>
<li>Binding corporate rules &ndash; this is where a large company&rsquo;s own internal processes for international data transfer have been signed off and agreed by the European Commission as safeguarding the data.</li>
<li>If the data is going to the USA it can be safely transferred to a company that is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.</li>
<li>Appropriate certification schemes</li>
</ul>
<p>We will disclose your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation. This includes disclosing information to organisations for the purposes of fraud protection, credit risk reduction, or the order of a court or regulator.</p>
<p>We also share your details with service providers who assist us with hosting our marketing campaigns and surveys but only in cases where you have consented to marketing or surveys. We will not provide your data to other third parties for marketing purposes unless you have specifically consented to this when you first provided your data to us. You are entitled to decline to receive such third-party communications by not selecting the appropriate box on the web form that collects your details or at any subsequent time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@findmypast.co.uk or by post to Findmypast, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ.</p>
