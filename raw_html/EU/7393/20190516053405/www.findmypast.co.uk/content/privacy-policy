<p>If you create a family tree or create content on the website, we also collect that information, which may include personal information about you and other people (for example, names and birthdays of people in your family). You should ensure, if you provide personal information about people in your family who are living and not deceased, that you have the consent from the relevant individual to include that personal information on the website.</p>
<p>We do not collect sensitive information (also known as special categories of information) about you except when you specifically knowingly provide it and have consented to this.

<h3 id="Section-3">3. How we use the information</h3>
<p><b><em>A. We will use your personal information for a number of purposes including </em></b></p>
<ul>
<li>To manage the website (including your account);</li>
<li>To provide you with a free trial (if requested);</li>
<li>To process orders and provide our services, goods or online content, to provide you with information about them and to deal with your requests and queries.</li>
<li>For administration purposes. This means we may contact you regarding goods or services ordered or online content you have signed up for, to let you know that a service or online site has been suspended for maintenance, if your subscription is about to expire to ask if you wish to renew it, or if an online account has become dormant to ask if you wish to retain the account before we close it.</li>
<li>To provide advanced website features to you and others.</li>
<li>We use IP addresses and device identifiers to identify the location of users, to establish the number of visits from different countries, to limit/cap adverts of a certain type, and to personalise content and emails.</li>
<li>For analysis and research to improve our services and goods offered.</li>
<li>To improve your search results.</li>
<li>A certain amount of advertising is tailored to the individual based on viewing and/or purchase habits. This is a common practice known as <a href="https://thedma.org/resources/compliance-resources/online-behavioral-advertising-compliance/ ">online behavioural advertising</a>.</li>
<li>We may show you relevant advertising on third party sites (e.g. Facebook, Google, and Twitter). Some third party sites allow you to request not to see messages from specific advertisers.</li>
<li>To conduct surveys with you (where you have consented to us contacting you for such purpose).</li>
<li>To provide personalised communications (more details below).</li>
<li>Where we provide personalised services, we may analyse the information you supply, as well as your activity on our (and other) services, so we can offer a more relevant, tailored service.</li>
<li>We may use and disclose information in aggregate (so no individuals are identified) for marketing and strategic development purposes.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b><em>B. Communications</em></b></p>
<p><b><em>i. Service messages</em></b></p>
<p>We send service emails to you to administer the service. Service emails include registration and payment confirmations and emails that provide useful information about how to use a service or feature when you sign up or start using it. We will also send you a service email if we make a fundamental change to the website, or to our terms &amp; conditions that we think we need to make you aware of, or to let you know important information about your account.</p>
<p><b><em>ii. Marketing messages</em></b></p>
<p>We use your email address to update you on new products, services and subscription offers. We will only contact you with your consent. You are entitled to withhold this consent and refrain from receiving such communications by selecting the appropriate option on the web form that collects your details. You can also update these options at any time by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences, by contacting us by email at support@findmypast.co.uk, by calling +44 (0)20 3326 6300 [UK, IE, AU] / +1 (855) 246-8234 [US] or by post to Findmypast, 6 Chapel Place, Rivington Street, London EC2A 3DQ. We will always provide you with a way of opting out of receiving future marketing messages from us each time we send them to you.</p>
<p><b><em>iii. Tree hints</em></b></p>
<p>Tree hints is a service of The Tree and the Family Tree. As you build your family tree we will send you hints using the information you have provided and matching that against the records we hold in our historical records. You can use the information you find in the records to add more information about your family history to your growing family tree. This is part of the Findmypast tree product, but if you wish to stop the tree hint emails you can do so within your tree settings.</p>
<h3 id="Section-4">4. What if I don&rsquo;t provide some or all of the information requested?</h3>
<p>The impact of this will depend on what information you withhold, but the main impacts may be:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will not be able to process or fully process your order.</li>
<li>We will not be able to contact you to let you know of problems regarding your order or the goods/services provided.</li>
<li>We will not be able to respond fully to requests and queries you may have.</li>
<li>We cannot personalise the service you receive. So, if you are online you will have to search more for the content type you normally view or for similar/related products.</li>
<li>We won&rsquo;t be able to limit online adverts to products or services you have shown interest in and so you may receive adverts that are not related to your interests.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="Section-5">5. What grounds (legal basis) are we processing the data under?</h3>
<p>There are a number of grounds we process your data under. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contractual &ndash; we need the information to perform the contract for goods or services you have requested/ordered including payment, delivery etc.</li>
<li>Legal &ndash; should we be legally required to contact you concerning a purchase or service.</li>
<li>Legitimate interest &ndash; this means the processing is in Findmypast&rsquo;s interest. It allows us to manage the customer relationship effectively and efficiently and improve the goods and/or services we provide by better understanding how our online provisions are used and which goods are popular with which groups of individuals.</li>
<li>Consent &ndash; where you have given us consent to market to you.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3 id="Section-6">6. Information stored in your family tree</h3>
<h2>Family Tree</h2>
<p>Building your family tree is an immensely valuable activity while you are exploring your family history. Trees allow you to store all your family history in one central area. You can attach historic records that you find on our site to your trees. At Findmypast, we are continuously improving our family trees and finding new ways for you to get the most out of your Findmypast experience. Recently, we have introduced The Tree (see below) and will be adding tree-to-tree hinting.</p>
<p><b><em>A. Privacy.</em></b> One of the most valuable resources for a community of users researching and building their family trees is access to the historical research of others. Because so many family trees intersect after a few generations, it is highly enriching for the whole community if as much of this historical research as possible is shared widely within this community.</p>
<p>When you create your family tree or upload a GEDCOM, the privacy settings are set to share deceased ancestors by default. We provide you with privacy controls to manage your family tree and control who can see the information in it within the Tree Settings page. You should familiarise yourself with how these controls work as you are responsible for using them.</p>
<p><em><b>i. When sharing Deceased Ancestors is switched on </b></em></p>
<ul>
<li>All personal information about living people remains private to you.</li>
<li>Information on deceased ancestors may be offered to other members as a hint if their tree appears to share common ancestors with your tree.</li>
<li>For deceased ancestors, the following information may be offered as part of a hint:</li>
<ul>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Facts and events &ndash; together with sources and attached records</li>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
<li>Photographs and media will not be shared. In the future, we will introduce more granular privacy controls to enable selective sharing of photographs.</li>
<li>In the future, you may benefit from the <a href="https://www.findmypast.co.uk/tree-change-faqs">tree-to-tree hinting service. </a></li>
<li>If your ancestors are not marked as deceased, but were born more than 110 years ago we will assume they are deceased. Please contact support@findmypast.co.uk if this is incorrect.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>ii. When sharing Deceased Ancestors is switched off</b> </em></p>
<ul>
<li>You may not benefit from the tree to tree hinting service and the historical information contained in the trees of the Findmypast community when this service is rolled out.</li>
<li>Other users will not be able to receive hints from deceased ancestors in your tree.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>B. Tree deletion.</b></em> Within the View All Trees area you can find an option to Remove Tree. This option will remove your tree from your tree view. Findmypast will delete all the data related to living people. In cases where a person is not noted as deceased, we will remove all the data for those who were born less than 110 years ago. If you want your entire tree deleted from Findmypast, please contact privacy@findmypast.co.uk. Once Tree to Tree Hinting is available, deleting your tree will not delete branches you have shared with other users.</p>
<p><b><em>C. Removal of unauthorised data.</em></b> We reserve the right (at our own discretion) to remove any personal data which you have included in your family tree, including The Tree, about people who are living if we are alerted to the fact that this personal data was used without that person&rsquo;s permission. If you become aware that your personal information has been included in somebody else's tree without your permission or is being misused in any other way on the website, please send an email to our Customer Support team support@findmypast.co.uk with details and we will investigate and, if necessary, remove this information. The information added about deceased persons is not considered personal data under this policy.</p>
<h2>The Tree</h2>
<p>This section is specific to use of your personal data within The Tree. The Tree is brought to you through our sister site RootsFinder and our partners at FamilySearch International. It gives users the opportunity to publically share their tree. Privacy settings are set to share deceased ancestors by default. Findmypast believes that sharing your family tree will help you find my family history connections and create a collaborative community sharing family history.</p>
<p>The Tree is stored and administered by RootsFinder and FamilySearch. To make changes, additions, or edits to The Tree, certain information from your Findmypast account and all your contributions to The Tree is shared with your consent with FamilySearch International and RootsFinder in the United States (more details below). If you do not want your data shared with RootsFinder and FamilySearch then you should not participate in The Tree. To understand more about FamilySearch&rsquo;s use of personal data, review the <a href="https://www.lds.org/legal/privacy-notice?lang=eng&amp;_r=1&amp;country=go"> FamilySearch privacy policy</a>. To understand more about RootsFinder&rsquo;s use of personal data, review the <a href="https://www.rootsfinder.com/privacy-policy">RootsFinder privacy policy.</a></p>
<p><b><em>A. Privacy.</em></b> The Tree is a collaborative environment and the settings are public by default. You will be able to view other trees, collaborate with other users, and share your family history with The Tree community.</p>
<p>Sharing settings are primarily focussed on the historical information around deceased individuals in family trees. No information on living individuals in your tree will be shared with other users of The Tree unless you explicitly choose for this to happen.</p>
<p>On this basis, when your tree is public:</p>
<ul>
<li>All users of The Tree (including other participating Findmypast users and global FamilySearch users) can view all your tree information related to deceased individuals (and only deceased individuals).</li>
<li>The tree information about deceased individuals includes:</li>
<ul>
<li>Timelines</li>
<li>Facts and events &ndash; together with sources and attached records</li>
<li>Notes</li>
</ul>
<li>Information about living individuals will be strictly limited. The presence of a living individual in a family tree will be indicated within only gender and surname.</li>
<li>Photographs and media will not be shared. In the future, we will introduce more granular privacy controls to enable selective sharing of photographs.</li>
<li>The Tree will continue to develop including the future ability to share your family tree and giving other users the ability to contribute and edit your tree.</li>
<li>The Tree users will be able to see your username. Also, when you contribute to other trees, your username will be displayed alongside those changes. A unique username will be generated for you and will show your full name and a number. For example, John Smith, will be JohnSmith_1. This marks your contribution to the tree and encourages accuracy.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><em>B. What information about me is shared with Rootsfinder and FamilySearch? </em></b> In the event that you wish to create a tree with The Tree certain information from your Findmypast account is shared by Findmypast with RoostFinder and FamilySearch. Findmypast will provide RootsFinder and FamilySearch with the following facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Account name</li>
<li>Email address</li>
<li>Birth date</li>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>All contributions to The Tree</li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>C. How will Findmypast and RootsFinder and FamilySearch use this information? </b></em>Your personal data will be used for the following purposes and on the following legal basis:</p>
<p><em>Where you provide your consent: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Findmypast will transfer your data to FamilySearch.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the purposes of providing you with The Tree services: </em></p>
<ul>
<li>RootsFinder and FamilySearch will use the details you provide to validate and verify your access to The Tree.</li>
<li>FamilySearch will set up a linked FamilySearch account to allow you to use the access and edit capabilities on the Community Shared Tree.</li>
<li>FamilySearch will use your IP Address to determine your country of residence. In certain countries, content will under the terms be restricted.</li>
<li>FamilySearch works in partnership with Findmypast to administer the access and provide you with The Tree service. FamilySearch will store all your contributions to The Tree.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>For the purpose of ensuring in our legitimate interests that:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>FamilySearch can contact a The Tree user only in cases of abuse of the tree. Examples of abuse include adding links to corrupt third party sites or continuously and maliciously adding incorrect data.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>What information from my tree is shared with RootsFinder and FamilySearch?</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All information you have added to your family tree.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><b>D. Tree deletion.</b></em> Within the View All Trees area you can find an option to Remove Tree. This option will remove your tree from your tree view. Findmypast will delete all the data related to living people. In cases where a person is not noted as deceased, we will remove all the data for those who were born less than 110 years ago. If you want your entire tree deleted from Findmypast, please contact privacy@findmypast.com. Once Tree to Tree Hinting is available, deleting your tree will not delete branches you have shared with other users.</p>
<p><em><b>E. Removal of unauthorised data.</b></em> We reserve the right (at our own discretion) to remove any personal data which you have included in your family tree, including The Tree, about people who are living if we are alerted to the fact that this personal data was used without that person&rsquo;s permission. If you become aware that your personal information has been included in somebody else's tree without your permission or is being misused in any other way on the website, please send an email to our Customer Support team privacy@findmypast.com with details and we will investigate and, if necessary, remove this information. The information added about deceased persons is not considered personal data under this policy.</p>
<p><b><em>F. Transfer outside the EEA.</em></b> RootsFinder and FamilySearch International are based in the United States which does not offer equivalent legal data protection standards to those found in Europe. To this end, Findmypast has taken appropriate measures to safeguard the transfer of your data outside the EEA through the use of EC approved model standard clauses for transfers of personal data or through your consent to send personal data outside the EEA.</p>
<h3 id="Section-7">7. Historic records and record matching</h3>
<p><b><em>A. Historic Records</em></b></p>
<p>Findmypast works with a number of trust third parties to bring you millions of historical records to assist you with your family history research. A full list of our partners is available on our <a href="https://www.findmypast.com/content/our-partners">Our Partners page</a>. Historic records on the site are reproduced under a third party agreement with licensors or we reproduce records that are within the public domain. We will continue to host these records as long as we retain an agreement with the licensor or as long as they are within the public domain.</p>
<p>You will find information about living individuals in some of our records. Examples of these records include civil birth and marriage indexes, electoral registers, company&rsquo;s house register, and more. The records we hold which contain the names of living people are public record and we provide the data based on our legitimate interest. In the examples, the records have been made public by the General Register Office or the Electoral Register. Records of living individuals allow users to build their family tree and research their family history from the current generation.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these records please contact our customer support at privacy@findmypast.co.uk. We will remove records of living people if it is requested by the individual named in the record. If you want to be removed from the UK Electoral Register records you will need to contact 192.com.</p>
<p><b><em>B. Record matching</em></b></p>
<p>Findmypast uses record matching technologies to suggest possible matches between historical records on Findmypast and associated partner trees on Family Historian or Roots Magic.</p>
<p>Record matching on Findmypast automatically matches historical records for your family tree. These records are pulled from our vast records database Record matching will save you time with your research and allow you to make fascinating discoveries through historical records such as birth, marriage and death documents and census records.</p>
<p>When record matching is enabled within partner sites such as Family Historian, Roots Magic, or other Desktop Software partners, information from small parts of your family tree is passed between the sites without you having to do anything, to a matching service on the Findmypast website. This information includes basic information such as names, dates and places associated with individuals and their close relatives. Findmypast uses this data to find accurate matches for relevant individuals. The matching service provides partner site users with suggested matches of ancestors&rsquo; birth, marriage, and death records. We will also provide matches for census records.

These third-party providers include payment processors, providers of card validation services, and credit referencing providers. This is necessary for the performance of the contract.

<li>The contract for data processing contains the standard contractual clauses laid down by the European Commission to safeguard the transfer of personal data.</li>
