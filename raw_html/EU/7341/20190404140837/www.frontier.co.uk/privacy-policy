	<li>How to access and control your information</li>
	<li>How we transfer the information we collect internationally</li>
	<li>Other important privacy information</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This privacy policy covers the information we collect about you when you use our products or services, or otherwise interact with us (for example, by attending our events), unless a different policy is displayed.</p>

<p>We refer to all our games together with our websites as &ldquo;Services&rdquo; in this policy.</p>

<p>This policy also explains your rights about how the information we hold on you is used. Your rights include how you can object to certain uses of information about you and how you can access and update certain information about you.</p>

<p><strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SERVICES OR INTERACT WITH ANY OTHER ASPECT OF OUR BUSINESS.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a id="information-we-collect">What information we collect on you</a></h1>

<h3><a id="overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>We collect information about you when:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You provide it to us.</li>

<p><strong><em>Content you provide through our games</em></strong></p>

<p>When you play our games, we collect information on how you use the game and certain events which you encounter when you play them.</p>

<p>Some of our games require to have a registered account on Frontier&rsquo;s online store. When you play these games on console, you still require a Frontier Developments account. The personal information we collect when you do this is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Email</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of our games will require you to create an in-game profile. The personal information we collect when you do this is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Username</li>
</ul>

<p>Your username is shown to other users who play the game. We suggest that you do not use your real name and you use a pseudonym instead.</p>

<p>Not all our games require you to have a registered account.</p>

<p>Should you experience any issues with the games, we provide tools which allow you to send us the following information:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Crash Dumps</li>

</ul>

<p>These will contain information about your computer.</p>

<p>The Services also include our customer support, where you can submit information about a problem you experience with a Service. When you engage with our support website and/or team you will be asked to provide contact information, a summary of the problem and any other documentation.</p>

<p>The contact information we ask you to provide is one or more of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Email Address</li>

<ul>
	<li>Name</li>
	<li>Email</li>
	<li>Address</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a id="how-we-use-the-information">How we use the information we collect</a></h1>

<p>How we use the information we collect depends, in part, on the Services you use, how you use them and any preferences you have communicated to us. These uses include providing, securing and improving the Services, communicating with you about the Services, support for the Services, and with your consent, additional marketing about the Services.</p>

<p><strong><em>To provide the Services</em></strong></p>

<p>We use the information about you to provide the Services to you, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Process transactions</li>
	<li>Authenticate you when you log in</li>
	<li>Provide customer support</li>
	<li>Operate and maintain the Services</li>
</ul>

<p>We are always looking for ways to improve our Services. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and feedback provided directly to us for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Troubleshoot any issues users are experiencing</li>
	<li>Identify any trends and activity patterns</li>
	<li>Identify areas which can be improved to help user experience</li>

	<li>Confirming your purchases</li>
	<li>Responding to questions and requests</li>
	<li>Providing customer support</li>
	<li>Sending you technical notices and updates</li>
</ul>

<p>These communications are part of the Services and, in most cases, you cannot opt out of them. If an opt out is available, you will find the option within the communication itself or in your account settings.</p>

<p>We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us. For example, certain actions you take within the Services may trigger a program to contact you with suggestions on other actions you can take.</p>

<p><strong><em>To market, promote and/or drive engagement with the Services</em></strong></p>

<p>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send you promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sending you an email</li>
	<li>Display Frontier Development game ads on other companies&#39; websites</li>
	<li>Displaying ads on third party platforms, for example Facebook</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Information about new Services</li>
	<li>Survey requests</li>
	<li>Newsletters</li>
	<li>Events we think may be of interest to you</li>
</ul>

<p>We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests. You can control whether you receive these communications as described in your account settings on the Frontier&rsquo;s online store.</p>

<p><strong><em>Community Promotions and Prizes</em></strong></p>

<p>We use your information to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Send and deliver prizes to you</li>

	<li>Monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity</li>
	<li>Identify violations of Service policies</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em></strong></p>

<p>Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>With your consent</em></strong></p>

<p>We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, we may publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the Services, with your permission.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="lawful-bases">Lawful bases for processing</a></h3>

<p>As we are a company that operates within the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable laws. The lawful basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We need it in order to provide you the Services, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalised features and to protect the safety and security of the Services.</li>
	<li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, to market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and interests.</li>
	<li>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.</li>
	<li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where we are using your information because we have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.</p>

<h1><a id="how-we-share-your-information" name="how-we-share-your-information">How we share the information we collect</a></h1>

<p>As we make online games, this means sharing information through the Services. We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below. We do not sell your information to third parties.</p>

<h3><a id="share-with-other-service-users">Sharing with other Service users</a></h3>

<p>When you use the Service, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p>

<p><strong><em>For game interactions</em></strong></p>

<p>We publish online games and these require users of the Service to have a username. This username is shared with other players for the following purposes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Add other players as friends</li>
	<li>Allow for in game interaction via chat functionality</li>
	<li>Reward players who have made some in-game achievement, for example visited certain areas of the game first</li>
</ul>

<p>There are certain features within our games that make game data public on other Services. The information made public varies between game and feature, however players will be notified of this information before they start using the feature. In some cases, players may prevent this information being made public by not using the specific feature. Otherwise, players will need to stop using the game in its entirety.</p>

<p>Within our Services, certain games allow for players to play the game their own way and create their own story. Some of our games therefore generate logs which show certain player interactions. This allows players to build up their own story outside the game. When a player interacts with a second player under certain circumstances, the second player&rsquo;s username will appear in the original player&rsquo;s logs. The information which is in these logs is information which has already been made public by players interacting with our Services.</p>

<p>How this information is used is up to the player and Frontier Developments cannot control how this is used. This feature is fundamental to using certain Services. If you do not wish your username to appear in these logs, then do not interact with the Services. If you terminate your game account, your username will still remain on players&#39; computers within these logs.</p>

<p><strong><em>Community Forums</em></strong></p>

<p>Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, forums and issue trackers, e.g.&nbsp;<a href="https://forums.frontier.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">Frontier Forums</a>. You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites &ndash; including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information, may be read, collected and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites. Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after your terminate your account. We strongly recommend you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services. To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as detailed below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to and why.</p>

<h3><a id="share-with-third-parties">Sharing with third parties</a></h3>

<p>We share information with third parties that help us operate, provide, improve, integrate, customise, support and market our Services.</p>

<p><strong><em>Service Provider</em></strong></p>

<p>We work with third-party service providers for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Website and application development</li>
	<li>Hosting</li>
	<li>Maintenance</li>
	<li>Backup</li>
	<li>Storage</li>
	<li>Virtual Infrastructure</li>
	<li>Payment processing</li>
	<li>Analysis</li>
	<li>Email Communications</li>
	<li>Marketing Communications</li>
</ul>

<p>If a service provider needs to access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p>

<p><strong><em>Links to Third party sites</em></strong></p>

<p>The Service may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We strongly recommend that you carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>

<p><em><strong><span class="diff-html-added" id="added-diff-1">Third party game services</span></strong></em></p>

<p><span class="diff-html-added">The Service can share information with Third party game services only when you have given Frontier permission via the Frontier Auth service.</span></p>

<p><strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights</strong></p>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our products and services, (d) protect Frontier Developments, our customers, or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="sharing-with-affiliated-companies"><strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong></a></h3>

<p>We share information we collect with affiliated companies.&nbsp;Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us. The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p>

<p><strong><em>Business Transfers</em></strong></p>

<p>We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in the event of any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company. In this case we will attempt to notify you (e.g. email and/or a prominent notice on the Services) if a transaction takes place, and outline any choices you may have regarding your information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a id="store-and-secure-information">How we store and secure the information we collect</a></h1>

<h3><a nid="storage-security">Information storage and security</a></h3>

<p>We use data hosting service providers in the United States, Ireland and Singapore to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.</p>

<p>The service provider we use in the United States is part of the US Privacy Shield which is an approved policy under EU law.</p>

<p>Although we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any data that we collect via our Services is transferred over an SSL protocol for security during transmission.</p>

<p>Access to the data is limited to trusted employees.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="how-long-we-keep-information">How long we keep information</a></h3>

<p>How long we keep information we collect depends on the type of information, as described below. After such time, we will either delete or anonymise your information or, if this is not possible (for example, the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.</p>

<p><strong><em>Account Information</em></strong></p>

<p>We retain your account information for as long as your account is open. Due to the nature of our Services, if you stop using our Services and do not tell us, your information will remain in case you decide to start using our Services again.</p>

<p>If at any point our Services stop, we will delete all the information we hold relating to the Service that has stopped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also retain some of your information that is necessary:</p>

<ul>
	<li>To comply with our legal obligations</li>
	<li>To resolve disputes</li>
	<li>To enforce our agreements</li>
	<li>To support business operations</li>
	<li>To continue to develop and improve our Services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Your use of Services</em></strong></p>

<p>The information we collect automatically when you use our Services is kept in active storage for varying lengths of time, as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Elite Dangerous game interactions will be kept for up to 3 months</li>
	<li>Other game interactions will be kept for up to 5 years.</li>
	<li>Website logs are not stored in an easy access format.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this information is archived for the lifetime of the Service.</p>

<p><strong><em>Device and Connection Information</em></strong></p>

<p>The device and connection information we automatically collect is kept in active storage for&nbsp;varying lengths of time</p>

<p>The varying lengths are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Elite Dangerous information will be kept for up to 3 months.</li>
	<li>Other game information will be&nbsp;kept for up to&nbsp;5 years.</li>
</ul>

<p>All this information is archived for the lifetime of the Service.</p>

<p>The device and connection information collected on the websites is all aggregated.</p>

<p><strong><em>Information you share on the Services</em></strong></p>

<p>If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain for other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp; For example, we continue to display your username in games where your username is tagged to a certain event that has taken place.</p>

<p><strong><em>Marketing information</em></strong></p>

<p>If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences until you opt out using the opt out feature in your account settings. We will remove you from our marketing emails should we receive 5 consecutive hard bounces from your account.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a id="access-and-control-information">How to access and control your information</a></h1>

<p>You have certain rights available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those rights, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p>

<h3><a id="your-rights">Your rights</a></h3>

<p>Below is a list of your rights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Request a copy of your information</li>
	<li>Object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes)</li>
	<li>Withdraw previously given consent</li>
	<li>Request the deletion or restriction of your information</li>
	<li>Request your information in a structured, electronic format</li>
	<li>Right to complain to a relevant supervisory authority</li>
</ul>

<p>Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests. You can exercise some of these rights by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Service or your account.</p>

<p>Your request and rights may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information we are permitted to by law or have a compelling legitimate interest to keep. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p>

<p><strong><em>Request a copy of your information</em></strong></p>

<p>You have the right to request any of the personal information we hold on you. You can do this by sending an email to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:dataprotection@frontier.co.uk" rel="nofollow">dataprotection@frontier.co.uk</a>&nbsp;and ask for your information.</p>

<p>We will provide this information to you within 1 month from the point we have all the information to process the request.</p>

<p>This information will be sent to you in English and in a computer readable format, unless another reasonable format is requested.</p>

<p><strong><em>Access and update your information</em></strong></p>

<p>Our Services give you the ability to access and update certain information about you from within the account settings in the Services. You can also opt out of certain communications in your account settings on Frontier&rsquo;s online store.</p>

<p><strong><em>Delete your account</em></strong></p>

<p>If you no longer wish to use our Services, you can contact our support team and ask for your account to be deleted. They will notify you if, for any reason, not all the information we hold can be deleted and will inform you of the implications of us deleting your account.</p>

<p>If you delete your account, you will permanently lose access to our Services, including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any purchases made</li>
	<li>Any game progress</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record keeping purposes, to complete transactions or to comply with our legal obligations.</p>

<p><strong><em>Request that we stop using your personal data</em></strong></p>

<p>In some cases, you may ask us to stop accessing, storing, using and otherwise processing your information where you believe we don&#39;t have the appropriate rights to do so. For example, if you believe a Service account was created for you without your permission or you are no longer an active user, you can request that we delete your account as provided in this policy. Where you gave us consent to use your information for a limited purpose, you can contact us to withdraw that consent, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place before that time. When you make such requests, we may need time to investigate and facilitate your request. If there is delay or dispute as to whether we have the right to continue using your information, we will restrict any further use of your information until the request is honoured or the dispute is resolved.</p>

<p><strong><em>Opt out of communications</em></strong></p>

<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us by using the unsubscribe link within each email, updating your email preferences within your account settings menu, or by contacting customer support to have your contact information removed from our promotional email list or registration database.&nbsp; Even after you opt out from receiving promotional messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional messages from us regarding our Services.</p>

<p>You may be able to opt out of receiving personalised advertisements from other companies who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative or who subscribe to the Digital Advertising Alliance&#39;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioural Advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutads.info</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Turn off Cookie Controls</em></strong></p>

<p>To opt-out of our use of cookies, you can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of our Services. Frontier Developments and our third party partners also collect information using web beacons (also known as &quot;tracking pixels&quot;).</p>

<p>Many browsers include their own management tools for removing HTML5 local storage objects.</p>

<p>You will not be able to opt-out of any cookies or other technologies that are &ldquo;strictly necessary&rdquo; for the Services.</p>

<p><strong><em>Send &quot;Do Not Track&quot; Signals</em></strong></p>

<p>Some browsers have incorporated &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (DNT) features that can send a signal to the websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked. Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret the DNT signal, our Services do not currently respond to browser DNT signals. You can use the range of other tools we provide to control data collection and use, including the ability to opt out of receiving marketing from us as described above.</p>

<p><strong><em>Data portability</em></strong></p>

<p>Data portability is the ability to obtain some of your information in a format you can move from one service provider to another (for instance, when you transfer your mobile phone number to another carrier).&nbsp; Depending on the context, this applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.&nbsp; Should you request it, we will provide you with an electronic file of your basic account information.</p>
