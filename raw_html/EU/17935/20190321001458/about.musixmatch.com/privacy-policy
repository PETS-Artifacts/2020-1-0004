              <h3 id="section-personal-data">2. What kind of personal data Musixmatch collects</h3>
              <p>We collect essentially three types of data:
              <ol>
                <li>Data you choose to provide to us</li>
                <li>Data we automatically collect when you use our services</li>
                <li>Data we receive from third parties </li>
              </ol>

              <h4 id="section-optional-data" style="font-size: 18px;letter-spacing: normal;">2.1. Data you choose to provide to us</h4>
              <p>You do not need to create an account to use some of our services’ features such as the research and display of lyrics and translations. However, if you decide to create a Musixmatch account and join our Community you will have to provide some data such as name, surname, e-mail address and the password you intend to use.<br>
              We will collect information on the contents you share, such as the song lyrics you upload, the lyrics’ translations you make, the comments you write when you join one thread on our Forum.<br>
              With your prior consent we will be allowed to use the microphone for songs’ immediate identification and lyrics’ synchronization.<br>
              With you prior consent we will be allowed to access your music library to play your favourite songs and synchronize them with our lyrics.<br>
              Other data we collect are those you choose to provide to us when you call the customer service or communicate with us in any other way.<p>
              <p>If you access our API (Application Programming Interface) or the developers’ portal, we will process your personal data to help provide our services. You can update your data by contacting us directly as indicated in this Privacy Policy.</p>
              <p>Please remember that most activities on Musixmatch are public, including information regarding your profile, language, the posts you share on our Forum, the comments to posts of other members of the Community, the lyrics and translations uploaded, their upload date, your opinion on posts.<br>
              You are responsible for the data you provide through our services and therefore we ask you to pay attention to what you make public!<p>

              <h4 id="section-mandatory-data" style="font-size: 18px;letter-spacing: normal;">2.2. Data we automatically collect when you use our services</h4>
              <p><strong>Data on devices and how they are used</strong> – We collect data on computers or other devices on which you set up our services or through which you access such services, based on the authorizations you provided. We could associate the data we collect from all your devices so as to provide coherent services on the different devices used. Here there are some examples of the data we collect regarding devices:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>your IP address</li>
                <li>date and time of access to our service</li>
                <li>hardware, software or browser you use and information on your computer’s operating system and application version</li>
                <li>language settings</li>
                <li>information on your clicks and pages that have been shown to you.</li>
              </ul>
              If you use a mobile device, we collect data identifying your device and the mobile’s settings and features (ID for advertisements and device’s unique token).<br>
              <strong>Data collected through cookies and similar technologies</strong> – We could use cookies and similar technologies (such as web beacon, web archives and device unique identifiers) to collect data on your activity, browser and device.<br>
              Most browsers are set to accept cookies by default. However, if you wish, you can change your browser and device settings. Please remember that the removal of some cookies might affect the proper functioning of some of our services.<br>
              When a browser or device allows it, we use temporary and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our services and to customize and use our services in various ways, for example to ensure your account’s safety or save your language preferences.<br>
              We might use such technologies also to collect data when you interact with our partners’ services, for example in relation to commercial and advertising services.<br>
              For more information on how we use cookies and on your settings, please refer to our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a>. For more information on the use of such technologies in our services from third parties, please refer to the <a href="#section-advertisement">Advertisement</a> section within this Policy.</p>

              <h4 id="section-other-data" style="font-size: 18px;letter-spacing: normal;">2.3. Personal data collected from other sources</h4>
              <p><strong>Social media</strong> – Musixmatch allows you to use social media websites to create your account as well as to share information with social media websites. Such social media could give us automatic access to some personal data saved by you (for example, contents viewed by the user, contents you like and information on the advertisments that have been shown to you or that you clicked on etc.). Moreover, by logging in through your Facebook or Google account and based on your privacy settings on such social media, your profile picture will automatically become the photo associated with your Musixmatch account. Musixmatch will not save, copy or scan such photo.<br>
              We also inform you that, by associating an account run by a social media website to your account and authorizing us to access such information, you accept that we could collect, use and save the data provided by these social media websites pursuant to this Policy.<br>
              We also might use plug-ins or other technologies from various social media websites. If you click on a connection provided through a social media plug-in, a connection with the relevant social media is automatically established.<br>
              <strong>External providers</strong> – We rely on external providers to handle payments, for example when you purchase a service or subscribe to Musixmatch. In such case, service providers share with Musixmatch some payment data to help us handle them and ensure you receive a service compliant with the Terms and conditions of use.<br>
              <strong>Websites and apps that use our services</strong> – Musixmatch can also collect data during the user’s visit to a website powered by any other company on behalf of Musixmatch, through automatic tools for data collection such as Web beacon, cookies and embedded web links. Those tools collect standard data on the web traffic the browser sends to the Musixmatch website, the browser’s type and language, time of access and internet address from which the Musixmatch website was accessed. They can also collect data on the IP address, unique identification of the device used, clickstream behaviour (that is pages visited, links opened and other activities of the user on “powered by” websites) and products. Musixmatch can also use some of those automatic tools for data collection through e-mails and communications from Musixmatch, collecting data when the user opens a message or clicks on a link in the message. For more information, please read our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie policy</a>.</p>

              </p>

              <h3 id="section-share-data">4. Who we share data with</h3>
              <p>As you may know, some of the data that concern you are public but you can choose to make your account “private”. This means that the contents you insert will be visible to you but you will not be identified by the Community.
              <strong>Remember</strong>: that does not relieve you of the responsibilities associated with an improper use of our services!<p>
              <p>We could also share data that concern you with third parties such as service suppliers, commercial partners and advertisers but in some cases you will have the opportunity to voice your opinion such as with regard to the Advertisements you view.
