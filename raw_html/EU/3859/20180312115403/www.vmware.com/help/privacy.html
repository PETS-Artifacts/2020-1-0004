				<h5><b>PART I: WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT &amp; HOW WE USE IT</b></h5>


<ol>
<li><b>Information we collect from you</b><br />
<p>We will collect personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we collect personal information when you order, register for (or to use), or request information about VMware products or services, subscribe to marketing communications, request support, complete surveys, provide in product feedback, or sign up for a VMware event or webinar.

In addition, we may collect personal information disclosed by you on our message boards, chat features, blogs and our other services to which you are able to post information and materials. Any information that is disclosed in those forums becomes public information and may therefore appear in public ways, such as through search engines or other publicly available platforms, and may be “crawled” or searched by third parties. It could also be read, collected or used by other users to send you unsolicited messages. Please do not post any information that you do not want to reveal to the public at large.<br />

<br />
<i><b>When using VMware products and services:</b></i><br />
<p>In connection with your organization’s deployment of certain VMware products and services, we may automatically collect certain data relating to the performance and configuration of the VMware products and services, and our customer’s and their end-user's consumption of and interaction and use of such products and services (&quot;<b>Usage Data</b>&quot;). Usage Data is generally technical information obtained from product software or systems hosting the services, devices accessing these products and services and/or log files generated during such use which typically does not directly identify an end-user.<br />
<br />
Certain VMware products and services participate in VMware’s customer product experience improvement programs and, depending on the program, our customers may have the ability to limit or control the extent of information collected. Where information is collected in these programs, the information is used by VMware for three core purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to facilitate the delivery of that VMware product or service and this may include tracking entitlements, verifying compliance, monitoring services and infrastructure performance, ensuring integrity and stability of the services or simply monitoring or addressing technical issues so we can deliver the product or service to the standards VMware has committed to;<br />
</li>
<li>to make recommendations for and to support the use of VMware products and services; and<br />
</li>
<li>to diagnose issues with and improve VMware products and services and related user experience.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>Some VMware products and services automatically collect and store certain Usage Data through cookies, pixel tags and other similar tracking technologies that uniquely identify a browser or device. For additional information about our use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies, please refer to our <a href="/help/privacy/cookie-notice.html">Cookie Notice</a>.<br />
<br />
Where applicable, customer agreements (including service descriptions), just-in-time notices, or other disclosures contained within the VMware products or services may describe more details about the collection and use of Usage Data by VMware for its own purposes. The technical information and identifiers collected are further described in our <a href="/content/vmware/language-master-sites/en/solutions/trustvmware.html">Trust &amp; Assurance Center</a> and, in some cases, will depend on the level of program participation selected by the customer.<br />
<br />
Usage Data does not include any of a customer's content uploaded to VMware products or services. If you are an individual user of VMware products or services and you require more information regarding our Usage Data collection practices for products and services deployed by your organization, please contact your IT administrator.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Information from third party sources and affiliated companies</b><br />
<p>From time to time, we may obtain information about you from third party sources as permitted by applicable law, such as public databases, resellers and channel partners, joint marketing partners, social media platforms. Examples of the information we may receive from other sources include: account information, job role and public employment profile, service and support information, information about your product or service interests or preferences, page-view information from some business partners with which we operate co-branded services or joint offerings, and credit history information from credit bureaus. We may use the information we receive from you to better understand you and/or maintain and improve the accuracy of the records we hold about you as well as to position, promote or optimise our products and services. We may also use this information in conjunction with your browsing habits / preferences (as obtained from our data partners) and your contact details, professional information and VMware transaction history (as obtained from our customer relationship management database) to deliver targeted advertising and marketing to you, where permitted by applicable law and in accordance with your advertising / marketing preferences.<br />
<br />
We may also obtain information about you from our affiliated companies, including Dell Technologies, Dell EMC, Pivotal, RSA, SecureWorks and VirtuStream (the <b>Dell Family</b>”) and, to the extent involved in the sales and marketing of our collective products and services, their appointed partners.<br />
<br />
We will use this information to provide support as well as to enhance our ability to provide relevant marketing, products, services and recommendations to you, and also to help monitor, prevent and detect fraud.<br />
<br />
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Information we process on behalf of our customers</b><br />
In the course of using our products and services, VMware customers and their end-users may submit or upload information to VMware's services for hosting or storage. This customer content is processed by VMware on behalf of the customer, and our privacy practices will be governed by the contract that we have in place with our customers, and this Privacy Notice will not apply to any personal information contained in such customer content. In accordance with such terms, VMware will process such customer content for the purposes of providing the relevant VMware services and in accordance with our customer's instructions. If you have any questions or concerns about how such information is handled, you should contact the person or entity who has contracted with VMware to use the VMware service to host or process this information (e.g. your employer). We will provide assistance to our customers to address any concerns you may have in accordance with the terms of our contract with them.</li>

				<h5><b>PART IV: SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY</b></h5>

<p>VMware maintains (and requires its service providers to maintain) appropriate organizational and technical measures designed to protect the security and confidentiality of any personal information we process. For example, VMware employs physical access controls, encryption, Internet firewalls, intrusion detection and network monitoring depending on the nature of the information and the scope of processing. VMware staff who may have access to personal information are required to keep that information confidential.<br />
However, no security procedures or protocols are ever guaranteed to be 100% secure and so we encourage you to take care when disclosing personal information online and to use readily available tools, such as Internet firewalls, anti-virus and anti-spyware software, and similar technologies to protect yourself online.</p>
