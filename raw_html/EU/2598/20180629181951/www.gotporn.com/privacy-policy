<p>Disclosure of Your Information for Third-Party Advertising. If you do not want the Company to share your personal information with unaffiliated or non-agent third parties for promotional purposes, you can opt out by changing your email settings in your account. You can also always opt out by contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0e69617a7e617c604e69617a7e617c60206d6163"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b1d6dec5c1dec3dff1d6dec5c1dec3df9fd2dedc">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

<h2>How do you access and correct your information?</h2>
<p>You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Website and visiting your account profile page. You may also contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c5b53484c534e527c5b53484c534e52125f5351"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="cbaca4bfbba4b9a58baca4bfbba4b9a5e5a8a4a6">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> to request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to the Company. The Company cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your account. The Company will not accommodate a request to change information if it believes the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.</p>
<p>If you delete your user contributions from the Website, copies of your user contributions might remain viewable in cached and archived pages, or might have been copied or stored by other users of the Website. The Website’s terms of use govern proper access and use of information provided on the Website, including user contributions.</p>
<h2>How does the Company protect your personal information?</h2>
<p>The Company has implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, change, and disclosure. All information you provide to the Company is stored on its secure servers behind firewalls. The Company encrypts all payment transactions using SSL technology. </p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where the Company has given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. The Company asks you not to share your password with anyone. In addition, the Company urges you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of the Website.</p>
<p class="alert-box">
<strong class="red">Warning:</strong> The transmission of information over the Internet is not completely secure.

<h2>Do Not Track Policy</h2>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. The Company is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. However, the Company does not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com" target="_blank">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>California Civil Code § 1798.83 permits users of the Website that are California residents to request certain information about the Company’s disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

<p>Further, if you are a California resident and would like to opt out from the disclosure of your personal information to any third-party for marketing purposes, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#a8cfc7dcd8c7dac6e8cfc7dcd8c7dac686cbc7c5"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a3c4ccd7d3ccd1cde3c4ccd7d3ccd1cd8dc0ccce">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.
