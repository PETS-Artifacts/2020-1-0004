Which of my details do you collect?
</h2>
<p>
We’ll ask for your full name (title, forename(s) and surname), date of birth, postal address, phone number, email address
and nominated bank account details. We ask for your bank details so that we can make payments to you, for example when you
make a withdrawal or win a Premium Bonds prize. When you’re making a deposit by debit card, we’ll need your card details.
And when making a cheque deposit to open an account, we’ll ask for details of the account on which the cheque is drawn.
</p>
<p>
We need this personal information so that we can provide you with the accounts or services that you have asked for. We also
need some of this information to meet our legal obligation to check your identity, address and source of funds. If you don't
provide it, then we won't be able to provide you with our accounts or services.

Our website does not capture or store personal information, other than what you tell us when submitting a form. Tools, such as calculators, do not store the information you enter. We may track the number of visitors to the website, but this tracking will not personally identify you. We use cookies to collect information on website usage, and to enable some of the website's services. When you use our website or apps, we collect information such as the browser you are using and the date, time and your IP address (a label used to identify your device on the internet).
</p>
<h3 class=h4>Social media</h3>
<p>We use social media, for example, Twitter and Facebook, to communicate with you. We also use posts on social media to find out how people view our products and services and have established an online research community - see below.
By engaging with us on social media you accept the following:
</p>
<p>We monitor social networks for comments about NS&amp;I and our products and services. We do this for training purposes and to help improve our products and services and to respond to your enquiries. Any comments or posts may be used for internal or external publication by NS&amp;I or any organisation working on our behalf for these purposes.
</p>
<p>Remember, your social network posts are not private and may be read by the general public. We’ll never ask you to post personal information or NS&amp;I account or security information on social networks and you should never do so. This includes private messaging, with the exception that we may on occasion ask you to provide your name and telephone number privately to allow us to help you further outside the social median channel.
</p>
<p>NS&amp;I accepts no responsibility for any personal data you post to social networks or websites. They may store your personal data outside the EU or in the US. Please read their privacy policies carefully.

<p>Any personal data you provide to EMR when you join the online research community, such as your name and email address, cannot be accessed by NS&amp;I. Any comments or feedback you provide will only be linked to your forum username. Any contributions you make to the forum, such as commenting on posts or creating discussions, can be seen by other members of the community, including NS&amp;I staff members involved in the community.
</p>
<p>We recommend that you refrain from posting anything that would be likely to identify you or another user, including full names, addresses, home or mobile phone numbers, passwords, credit card numbers, copies of private emails or messages and any private images of yourself.

and keep you up to date with information about your account(s).
</p>
<p>
We may also use your information to:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
meet our legal obligation to check your identity, address and source of funds
</li>
<li>
prevent or detect fraud or other crime
</li>

<li>
run competitions, events and promotional activities
</li>
</ul>
<p>
When you call us, we may monitor or record your call for training or quality assurance. We also record calls so that we

We use selected organisations to help us deliver the service we provide to you. We may share your personal information with:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>our service providers</strong>
who provide data processing services to us, for example helping to administer your account and investments, printing and
sending warrants and statements to you, and sending you emails about your accounts. We only share the information that's
necessary for them to provide their services
</li>
<li>
<strong>credit reference agencies</strong>
to check your identity, address and source of funds, and to prevent fraud
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may also share your information with
<strong>government bodies, law enforcement agencies, courts or other third parties</strong>

How long do you keep my information for
</a>
</h3>
<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
We keep personal information we collect from you where we have an ongoing legitimate need to do so (for example, to provide you with the accounts you have opened or to comply with legal, financial, tax or accounting requirements). We keep your personal information for seven years in line with industry best practice and in accordance with the Limitation Act 1980.
</p>
<p>
We keep records of Premium Bonds holdings for longer than seven years. This is to allow us to reallocate prizes where we discover that one or more prizes paid out were not valid. This can happen, for example, when a Bond holder dies but no one tells us.
</p>
<p>Your rights in relation to data retention include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The right of access.
</li>
<li>The right to rectification – unless the data form part of a historical record that was correct at the time they were collected or used.
</li>
<li>The right of erasure – only applies where we are holding your personal information beyond our statutory, regulatory or legitimate timescales.
</li>

Premium Bonds and the prize draw
</a>
</h3>
<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
We keep records of Premium Bonds holdings for longer than seven years. This is to allow us to reallocate prizes where we
discover that one or more prizes paid out were not valid. This can happen, for example, when a Bond holder dies but no one
tells us.
</p>
<p>
Each month we publish the winning Premium Bonds numbers on our website, together with the value of the prize, the value
of the holding, the date the Bond was bought and the area where the Bond holder lives. We do not publish the names or other
details of Premium Bonds winners.

<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
In some circumstances, your information is processed outside the UK and Europe, to key in transactions or respond to correspondence. These countries may have data protection laws that are different to those in Europe, which may be less protective. In these cases we will ensure that your information is processed in line with data protection law in Europe.
</p>
<p>
For example, our operational partner carries out some ‘back-office’ administration for us in India. They have in place ‘Binding Corporate Rules’ (contractual obligations) which require them to process your information in line with European data protection law.

To make sure you can receive information and communications from us, please make sure you tell us whenever you change your

<p>
If you have a question, sometimes it’s not convenient to call. That’s one reason we’ve introduced web chat – our online instant chat service. When using our web chat, we may ask you to provide personal information such as your name, address, date of birth, email address and other information such as the reason for the chat. We will also collect your IP address automatically. We ask for this information to help us identify you and give you the best service, and for training and quality purposes. We may also invite you to take part in an optional short survey after your web chat has finished.
</p>
<p>We are committed to keeping your personal information secure and confidential. We won’t share your personal information from web chat with any third parties or use it for marketing purposes. We will not transfer any of your personal information from web chat outside the European Economic Area.
</p>
<p>A transcript of each chat session is created automatically. You can download a copy of the transcript at any time during the chat. We keep a copy of the transcript for up to seven years, in line with our data retention policy.

Voice applications

<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
At NS&amp;I we’re committed to making it easier for customers to know if their Premium Bonds have won any prizes. That’s why we introduced our Premium Bonds prize checker voice applications, so you can find out if you have won any prizes through a voice-enabled device such as Amazon Alexa.
</p>
<p>By using our voice applications, you acknowledge that your data will be processed in line with this privacy notice.
</p>
<p>The applications require your NS&amp;I number or Premium Bonds holder’s number, or the NS&amp;I number or holder’s number of any friends or family who want to use the voice application to check their Premium Bonds prizes. You will need to assign a name or nickname to each number you provide, to make it easier to know whose Premium Bonds you are checking. The numbers and names/nicknames you provide will be stored on the systems that run the application. If you provide someone else’s number(s) on their behalf, you must have their permission.
</p>
<p>The voice applications do not need any other personal data.
</p>
<p>We may store the commands and phrases you use to interact with the applications, and we may use them to improve the service. Your voice input will also be recorded and processed by your voice device provider. If your voice input contains any personal data these will also be recorded by your provider. Please see their privacy policy to find out more about how they collect and use your data.
</p>
<p>Please be aware that the voice applications will respond to anyone who has access to your device and NS&amp;I number, holder’s number or name/nickname. They will read out prize winnings, including high value prizes, regardless of your location, meaning that other people nearby may overhear this. For this reason, please be careful where and when you use the voice applications.

<h2 class=header--tab>
The legal background and your rights
</h2>
<p>
Here we summarise the lawful basis on which we collect and use your information and outline the rights you have under current
data protection legislation.
</p>
</div>
<ul class=accordian>
<li>
<h3 class=header--accordian>
<a href="#lawful-basis" id=lawful-basis>
Lawful basis
</a>
</h3>
<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
We are allowed to use your personal information for a range of reasons, called ‘lawful bases’. These are:
</p>
<h4>
Contract
</h4>
<p>
We need to collect and use your personal information to be able to provide you with the savings account(s) that you want
to open and use. We cannot provide the service if you don’t give us the information we ask for.
</p>
<h4>
Legal obligation
</h4>
<p>
We may need to use your personal information to meet our legal obligations, for example if we need to check your identity,
address and source of funds to comply with the Money Laundering Regulations.
</p>
<h4>
Legitimate interests
</h4>
<p>
We have a legitimate interest in promoting our accounts and services. For this reason, we may use your personal details
to, for example, send you marketing information about our own accounts or services that we think you may be interested in.
We may also invite you to take part in research or surveys to help us improve the products and services that we offer. You
can ask us to stop sending you marketing and/or research invitations at any time.
</p>
<h4>
Consent
</h4>
<p>
We only rely on consent as a lawful basis for using your personal information in a few limited circumstances, for example
if you ask us to share your account information with an authorised third party who offers an Open Banking service; or if
you want us to share information with your financial adviser or nominated representative. You can withdraw your consent at
any time, and we make it as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.
</p>
<h4>
Public task
</h4>
<p>
There are times when we need to share information with other government bodies to allow them to meet their legal obligations,
for example where HM Revenue &amp; Customs need to know how much gross interest you have earned during a tax year.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class=accordian>
<li>
<h3 class=header--accordian>
<a href="#lawful-basis" id=lawful-basis>
Your rights
</a>
</h3>
<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
You have a range of data protection rights in relation to the information we hold about you. You can exercise any of these rights by contacting us. Note that not all of the rights are absolute – some of them depend on which lawful basis we are using to process your information.
</p>
<h4>
Right to be informed
</h4>
<p>
You have the ’right to be informed’ about the processing of your personal data, in addition to other information necessary for how we process your data in a fair and transparent way. We use this privacy notice, as the main way of providing you with ‘privacy information’. We provide you with this information at the time we collect your data or, if we obtain your data from another source (for example where a grandparent completes a Premium Bonds application form for a child and gives details of the child’s parent), then we will provide this privacy information within one month, usually as part of a ‘welcome pack’. You can contact us if you need further information. This right to be informed applies to data processing for any of the purposes listed in the lawful bases section.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we do not have to provide this information. For example where:
</p>
<ul>
<li>you already have the privacy information and nothing has changed
</li>
<li>giving you the privacy information is impossible or would require ‘disproportionate effort’, or
</li>
<li>giving you the privacy information would make it impossible to use your data or seriously damage the reasons for its use.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Right of access
</h4>
<p>You have a right to receive a copy of your personal information, this is known as a ‘right of access’. If you are concerned about the way NS&amp;I collects and uses your personal data, you can make a data subject access request and we will send you a copy of the information we hold about you. This is another way for you to be informed of which personal data we hold and how we use it, in addition to this privacy notice.
</p>
<p>When we reply, you will receive:
</p>
<ul>
<li>confirmation that we are processing your personal data;
</li>
<li>a copy of your personal data; and
</li>
<li>
other supplementary information (largely corresponding to the information that you may find in our privacy notice).
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can make a subject access request verbally or in writing. The Information Commissioner’s Office recommends that if you make your request verbally, you should follow it up in writing to provide a clear trail of correspondence and help explain what information you are asking for.
</p>
<p>If you want to make a subject access request another way, for example, through web chat or secure message, and do not use the form, you will need to give us the same details.
</p>
<p>If you want to make a subject access request via social media your request will be public and we do not recommend its use. If we are unable to identify you in this way, you will still need to send us the same details that the form requires, preferably by a more secure channel.
</p>
<p>This right applies to data processing for any of the purposes listed in the lawful bases section, but in some cases (for example market research or statistical data) where we are not able to identify you, we would not be able to provide you with that information.
</p>
<p>You can download and print a data subject access request form or contact us with all the information we ask for on the form. </p>

</p>
<p>
<a href="/how-do-i-get-touch">
Call us
</a>
</p>
<h4>
Right to data portability
</h4>
<p>Where we process your personal information by automated means for contractual purposes, or with your consent, you can ask us to provide a copy of the information we hold about you in a structured, machine readable format (for example a CSV file). You also have the right to ask us to transfer your data to another organisation but only where this is ‘technically feasible’. This is known as the ‘right to data portability’.
</p>
<p>This right only applies to personal data:</p>
<ul>
<li>held electronically, and
</li>
<li>that you have provided to us.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data you have provided does not just mean information you have typed in, such as a username or email address, but may also include data we hold in relation to your use of an account or service. This may include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>website or search usage history
</li>
<li>payments in or out of a savings account.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, under ‘Open Banking’ you may choose to share some of the transaction data relating to some of our accounts with another banking service provider.
</p>
<p>
<a aria-label="Click the link to go to the website of open banking" href="https://www.openbanking.org.uk">Open Banking</a>
</p>
<p>Where we process your personal information by automated means for contractual purposes, or with your consent, you can ask us to provide the information we hold about you in a structured, machine readable format (for example a CSV file). </p>
<h4>
Right to rectification
</h4>
<p>You have the ‘right to rectification’ of your personal information. You have the right to have information we hold about you corrected where it is incorrect or out of date, and completed where it is incomplete. We occasionally contact customers to improve the quality and completeness of the data we hold, but we rely on you to let us know if your circumstances or details have changed (for example if you change your name or address).
</p>
<p>If the information we hold about you is incorrect, out of date or incomplete, please let us know and we will put it right. You should:
</p>
<ul>
<li>state clearly what you believe is inaccurate or incomplete
</li>
<li>explain how we should correct it, and
</li>
<li>where available, provide evidence of the inaccuracies.
</li>
</ul>
<p>While this right applies to data processing for any of the purposes listed in the lawful bases section, there may be some cases where we would not need to rectify your data (for example if we test our systems or services using ‘scrambled’ data to partially obscure your identity, that scrambling is intentional and will not affect the data we hold as part of your customer record). If we are satisfied that the personal data we hold are accurate, we will tell you that we will not be amending the data. We will explain our decision, and let you know of your right to make a complaint to us. You may then complain to the ICO or to seek to enforce your right through a judicial remedy.
</p>
<p>There are some cases where rectification would not be possible, for example where we have anonymised your personal data for market research purposes or statistical analysis. In these cases it would not be possible to identify your data, so it would be impossible to verify its accuracy or restrict its use or delete it.
</p>
<p>You also have the ‘right to be notified‘ about any rectification of your personal data or restriction of its processing with regard to any organisations if and when we have shared your information with them. You also have the right to be informed of who we share your information with and why. Much of this information is provided in this privacy notice and is again available through a data subject access request (see ‘Right of access’, above)
</p>
<h4>Right to restrict processing
</h4>
<p>You can limit the way NS&amp;I uses your personal data if you are concerned about the accuracy of the data or how it is being used. If necessary, you can also stop NS&amp;I deleting your data. Together, these opportunities are known as your ‘right to restriction’.
</p>
<p>Like the right to rectification, this right applies to data processing for any of the purposes listed in the lawful bases section, unless we have anonymised your personal data (for example, for market research purposes or statistical analysis). In these cases it would not be possible to identify your data in order to restrict its use.
</p>
<p>You can ask us to temporarily restrict the use of your data when we are considering:
</p>
<ul>
<li>a challenge you have made concerning the accuracy of the data we hold, or
</li>
<li>an objection you have made to the use of your data.
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also ask us to restrict the use of your data rather than delete it if:
</p>
<ul>
<li>we have processed your data unfairly or unlawfully but you do not want it deleted, or
</li>
<li>we no longer need your data but you want us to keep it to create, exercise or defend a legal claim.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some cases where rectification would not be necessary, for example:
</p>
<ul>
<li>we have your consent to continue processing your data
</li>
<li>the data are needed for legal claims
</li>
<li>the data are needed to protect another person’s rights, or
</li>
<li>its use is for reasons of important public interest.
</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Right to erasure
</h4>
<p>You can, in some circumstances, ask us to delete personal data that we hold about you. This is known as the ‘right to erasure’, also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’.
</p>
<p>This right applies to data processing for any of the purposes listed in the lawful bases section, where:
</p>
<ul>
<li>we no longer need the personal data for the purposes for which we originally collected it, or
</li>
<li>the processing is based on your consent and you have withdrawn your consent, or
</li>
<li>you have objected to the processing and we do not have any overriding legitimate reason to continue the processing, or
</li>
<li>we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes and you object to that processing, or
</li>
<li>we have unlawfully processed the personal data, or
</li>
<li>we have to erase the personal data to comply with a legal obligation in UK law.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of our processing is governed by contractual, statutory or regulatory purposes, and these purposes often dictate how long we need to keep your personal data for. Please see our ‘How long do you keep my information for’ section of this privacy notice.
</p>
<p>The right to erasure does not apply if we need to process your data for one of the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to comply with the Freedom of Information Act 2000;
</li>
<li>when we are legally obliged to keep hold of your data;
</li>
<li>for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority;
</li>
<li>when erasing your data would prejudice scientific or historical research, or archiving that is in the public interest; or
</li>
<li>when keeping your data is necessary for establishing, exercising or defending legal claims.
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some cases where we would be unable to comply with your erasure request, for example, where we have anonymised your personal data for market research or statistical analysis. In these cases, it would not be possible to identify your data, and therefore impossible to comply with your right to erasure.
</p>
<p>If, having considered your request, we decide not to erase your data, we will still reply to you and explain why not, and let you know about your right to make a complaint to us. You may then complain to the ICO or seek to enforce your right through a judicial remedy.
</p>
<h4>Right to object
</h4>
<p>
Where we are processing your personal information for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of our official authority or where we have a legitimate interest in doing so, you can object to the processing, based on your particular situation, on the grounds that it is causing you damage or distress (for example financial loss), or where it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms, and you’d like us to stop. You must clearly state the specific reasons for your objection, based on your particular situation.
</p>
<p>If we agree to your objection, we will stop using your data for that purpose unless we can give strong and legitimate reasons to continue using your data despite your objections. You have an absolute right to object to us using your data for direct marketing (in other words, trying to sell things to you). This means we will stop using the data for this purpose without seeking a legitimate reason to continue.
</p>
<p>
Before objecting you will need to know which lawful basis we are relying on (see the lawful bases section). This is because you can only object to processing when we are using your data:
</p>
<ul>
<li>for a task carried out in the public interest
</li>
<li>for a task carried out in the exercise of our official authority
</li>
<li>for our legitimate interests
</li>
<li>for scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes, or
</li>
<li>for direct marketing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Generally, the reason we process your personal data will determine whether or not you can object. However, there are some cases where we would be unable to comply with your objection, for example where we have anonymised your personal data for market research or statistical analysis. In these cases it would not be possible to identify your data, so it would be impossible to comply with your right to object.
</p>
<p>We can refuse to comply with your objection if we can prove we have a strong reason to continue processing your data that overrides your objection, or where the use of your data is for a legal claim.
</p>
<h4>Right not to be subject to automated decision-making
</h4>
<p>Some of our processes are partly or wholly automated, but we don’t make decisions that have a significant or legal effect without human involvement. For example, we may check your evidence of identity electronically, but if this is unsuccessful we will write to you to ask for documentary evidence instead.
</p>
<p>
When decisions are made about you without people being involved, this is called ‘automated individual decision-making or ‘automated processing’ for short and includes some profiling.
</p>
<p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision that is based solely on automated processing if the decision affects your legal rights or other equally important matters (for example automatic refusal of an online credit application, and e-recruiting practices without human intervention).
</p>
<p>
We do not make decisions based solely on automated processing. Where automated decisions may be made, these are usually:
</p>
<ul>
<li>necessary for the purposes of a contract between you and NS&amp;I
</li>
<li>authorised by law (for example to prevent fraud or tax evasion), or
</li>
<li>based on your explicit consent.
</li>
</ul>
<p>In these cases, there is always some form of human intervention at the decision stage and we offer the following additional rights:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to understand the reasons behind decisions made about you and the possible consequences of the decisions, and
</li>
<li>to object to profiling in certain situations, including for direct marketing.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Nevertheless, we still comply with the GDPR principles and we have explained our lawful bases for processing your personal data. We also have processes in place so that you can exercise your rights, as explained in this privacy notice.
</p>
<h4>Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority
</h4>
<p>
If you have a complaint about the way we have used your information, please contact us first and we will do our best to put things right for you. If you’re not happy with our response, you can escalate your complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – see the end of this privacy notice for their contact details.
</p>
<h4>Additional rights
</h4>
<p>You also have the right to a judicial review where you consider that your rights under the data protection legislation have been infringed, or as a result of us processing your personal data in non-compliance with the legislation.
</p>
<p>Where you have suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of the data protection legislation, you have the right to receive compensation from us for the damage suffered.
</p>
<p>Additionally, you have the right to representation, to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association to lodge a complaint with NS&amp;I, or with the ICO, to seek a judicial review and receive compensation on your behalf where allowed for by the Data Protection Act 2018.
</p>
<h4>Where we can refuse
</h4>
<p>We can refuse to comply with your data subject rights request if we can prove we have a strong reason to continue processing your data that overrides your objection, or where the use of your data is for a legal claim, or where the data has been anonymised or scrambled and we are not be able to identify it as your data. We can also refuse to comply if we believe that your request is ‘manifestly unfounded or excessive’ or repetitive in nature. In all these cases, we will explain our decision, and let you know of your right to make a complaint to us. You may then complain to the ICO or to seek to enforce your right through a judicial remedy.
</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot refuse your request to stop sending you marketing communications.
</p>

What is the GDPR?

</h3>
<div class=accordian-panel>
<div class=accordian-panel-content>
<p>
The General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) is a set of regulations that changes how your personal information can be used, giving you more control over your data. It also ensures that organisations protect your personal information better. GDPR replaces the old Data Protection Act 1998, and came into force in the UK on 25 May 2018.
