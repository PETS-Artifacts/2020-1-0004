				<h1 class="mb5">Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p>**NOTICE: Unity published its new privacy policy (below) on October 5, 2015.  If you start using the Unity products or services on or after October 5, 2015, this policy governs Unity’s collection and use of your information.  If you used the Unity products or services before October 5, 2015, the collection and use of your information is currently governed the policy you accepted when you started using the relevant service, including ad, game replay and analytics services offered by Unity Analytics, Unity Ads or Everyplay. However, if you continue to use Unity products or services on or after November 5, 2015 this policy will govern the collection and use of your information.</p>

<h2>1. Frequently Asked Questions – FAQs</h2>

<p>Because we realize that privacy policies tend to be long and not terribly exciting, we’ve developed these FAQs to provide shortcuts to certain information in our Privacy Policy.  These shortcuts are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices we provide in our complete Privacy Policy. The complete version of our Privacy Policy governs our collection, use, storage and sharing of information we collect or receive from you.</p>

<h3>Q: I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?</h3>

<p>A: You can access and update your account info by logging into the Unity Store and navigating to the My Account page.  We collect Log Info, including IP Address and device data, related to your visits to our site.  We use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order for Unity to improve its software and services.  We also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the Software which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software.  You should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity.  If you use Unity developer services such as mobile advertising and analytics, read the applicable FAQs below and our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy#cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

<h3>Q: I use the forums on the Unity web site, what should I know?</h3>

<p>A: When you post comments on our forums, visitors and other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.</p>

<h3>Q: I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?</h3>

<p>A:  Unity has probably collected some or all of the following information about your device: Unique device identifier generated from the device MAC/IMEI/MEID (which we immediately convert into a different number using a one way hash); IP address; Device manufacturer and model; the operating system and version running on your system or device; browser type; language; the make of the CPU, and number of CPUs present; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (example: "nv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71"); which graphics API is in use (example: "OpenGL 2.1" or "Direct3D 9.0c"); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Player; version of the Unity Editor used to create the content; a number describing whether the player is running on Mac, Windows or other platforms; and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it did transmit correctly; application or bundle identification ("app id") of the game installed.  Some Unity developers use Unity’s analytics and ad services which collect additional information. See FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below.</p>

<h3>Q: That seems like a lot of data, why so much?</h3>

<p>A: We try to limit the collection of this information from any one player or device; however, certain operating systems do not permit us to note that the info has already been collected.  This means that the data may be sent to Unity each time you start the game.  We use the information to make decisions about which platforms, operating systems and versions of them should be supported by our game development software.  We aggregate this data and make it available to developers at <a href="http://stats.unity3d.com">stats.unity3d.com</a>. This data helps us improve our Services and helps developers improve their apps.</p>

<h3>Q: I play a game that uses Unity Analytics, what do I need to know?</h3>

<p>A: At the developer’s request, Unity has collected device information, like IP Address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications, the value and details of purchases.  Using our systems the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data.  Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games.  These reports are based, in part, on your information, but do not specifically identify you or your device.  If the developer uses Unity Analytics, the game was built using Unity’s game development software so be sure to review FAQ # 1.</p>

<h3>Q: I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?</h3>

<p>A: Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP Address and device identifiers, as well as information regarding the delivery of the ad and your interaction with it, which will be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies.  If Unity provides personalized advertising, it will provide you notice and an ability to opt-out of such interest based advertising.  Please review our <a href="/legal/cookie-policy#cookies">Cookie Policy</a> to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.</p>

<h3>Q: What are device identifiers, like IDFA or fingerprints, and why do you collect them?</h3>

<p>A: Like many other providers of mobile apps instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the user’s device.  Device IDs are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.  For example, if we want to effectively limit the number of ads a particular device receives about our apps, we or an ad network delivering ads on our behalf needs to recognize the device across apps.</p>

<h3>Q: I use Unity’s game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?</h3>

<p>A: Unity has probably collected one or more device identifiers and your IP address as well as your activity within the service. If you have created an account with Unity’s game replay service, Unity has received any information you actively provided when setting up your account, including email address and username.  Our primary use of your data will be provision of the game replay platform and all its features, including analysis and improvement.  You can access and update your account info by visiting <a href="https://everyplay.com">Everyplay</a> and navigating to the user settings page.  Also:</p>

<ul>
<li>When you create an account or profile your username, profile photo, cover photo, user description, users that you follow and users that follow you will all be public, which means that anyone can see that information and we may share it.</li>
<li>Replays that are set to public will be viewable by anyone AND the service or the relevant Developer may use the replay to promote the service or the relevant game.</li>
<li>When you comment on, share or like a replay using the Unity game replay platform, your replay, including any audio or video narration you attached to the replay, like or comments will be visible to others.  </li>
<li>When you share a replay on a social network - depending on your privacy settings at the relevant social network, some users of the relevant social network will see the replay.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Q: I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store, what do I need to know?</h3>

<p>A: Unity has probably collected information about your device, including IP Address, and your use of the site as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and ensuring that you are paid in accordance with our agreement. Other uses might include, sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.  You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page.  Also, when you publish or provide assets for license on the Asset Store your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.</p>

<h3>Q: I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store, what should I know?</h3>

<p>A: Unity has probably collected information about your device, including IP Address, and your use of the site as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account.  Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased.  Other uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store.  You can access and update your account info by logging in to Asset Store and visiting your My Account page.</p>

<h3>Q: I play a game published by Unity, what should I know?</h3>

<p>A: Unity or the game developer has probably collected your device information, like IP Address and device identifier, as well as events completed within the game.  See FAQ 3) above. Additionally, Unity has collected any information you have actively shared, such as any username that you created.  Our primary use of your information will be ongoing provision of the game.  Other uses might include analyzing your usage to personalize the game to you or to improve it generally.  If you wish to access your information or delete your game account, send an email to privacy@unity3d.com.</p>

<h2>2. Privacy Policy overview</h2>
