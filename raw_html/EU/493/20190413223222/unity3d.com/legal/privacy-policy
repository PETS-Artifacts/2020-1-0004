				<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
				<p><strong>Last Updated:Â September 7, 2018</strong></p><h2>1. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><p>These FAQs provide a handy entry point to our longer and more comprehensive Privacy Policy (see Section 2 below). They are intended to enhance rather than replace the important notices in the Privacy Policy, which governs our collection, use, storage, and sharing of the information that we collect or receive from you.</p><h3>What's new as of May 25, 2018?</h3><p>In these new FAQs, we provide more examples of how we may use some of the data we collect. They enhance our prior explanations but are not intended to imply that these are new uses of collected data. Additionally, if your data indicates you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), we have added information regarding new opt-out capabilities enabled for in-game advertising, and information on how you can exercise your data access and deletion (erasure) rights. Over the next few months, we will introduce the following âData Privacyâ icon to our ads, dashboards, and other points of interaction:</p><p><img class="media-element file-default" data-delta="1" src="/sites/default/files/gdpr-32px-black4x_0.png" alt="" /></p><p>This icon will show you where you can review your data and exercise your privacy choices. It is meant as a helpful access point for viewing your personal data in the context of its use within Unity systems. For those playing games where Unity ads appear, you may see the icon instead of the traditional information (ââ¹â) button. For those using our software to build games, you may see it in a privacy dashboard.</p><h3>I am a game developer that uses Unity software to build my game, what should I know?</h3><p>You can access and update your information by logging into your Unity account on our website. We use analytics services to understand how developers use our software in order to improve our software and services. We also include certain device data collection in the runtime of the software, which is incorporated into the applications you create with the software. You should be sure that your privacy policy explains to your players the variety of technical information that is collected and shared with third parties like Unity. If you use Unity developer services such as Mobile Advertising and Analytics, read the applicable FAQs below and ourÂ <a href="/legal/cookie-policy#cookies">Cookie Policy</a>.</p><h3>I visit the Unity website, what should I know?</h3><p>We collect log info, including IP address and device data, related to your visits to our site. When you post comments on our community pages and forums, other forum users will be able to see your username, photo and comments. When you post, you should assume that all the information you provide is public.</p><h3>I play a game built with Unity software, what should I know?</h3><p>Unity has collected some or all of the following information about your device: unique device identifiers (e.g., IDFV for iOS devices and Android ID for Android devices); IP address; country of install (mapped from IP address); device manufacturer and model platform type (iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, etc.) and the operating system and version running on your system or device; language; CPU information such as model, the number of CPUs present, frequency, and instruction set support flags; the graphics card type and vendor name; graphics card driver name and version (e.g., ânv4disp.dll 6.10.93.71â); which graphics API is in use (e.g., âOpenGL 2.1â or âDirect3D 9.0câ); amount of system and video RAM present; current screen resolution; version of the Unity Editor used to create the game; sensor flags (e.g., device support for gyroscope, touch pressure or accelerometer); application or bundle identification (âapp IDâ) of the game installed; unique advertising identifiers provided for iOS and Android devices (e.g., IDFA or Android Ad ID); and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it transmitted correctly.</p><p>Some Unity developers use Unityâs Analytics and Ad services, which collect additional information (see FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below for details); however, our usage of this data is largely for the following purposes. In serving ads, we try to predict which ads will be of most interest to you based on the games you play and the ads you watch. For analytics, we assist our developers to deliver the best game experience for you. For example, game developers who use our software often standardize certain features to enhance game player experience, such as saving your place in a game. This means that the game level you reached in your last session is where you will begin when you return to the game. Developers also need our assistance in tracking when you are eligible to redeem a reward within a game, such as when you have completed a challenge and get store credits to purchase new tools to play the game. Â In our analytics service, some of your data points will also be rolled up into an anonymized, aggregated format to help game developers make decisions about how they support their games. For example, if a game developer is considering phasing out support for an older version of iOS software, they may look at the total number of players currently using that version of iOS software to determine if they need to support that version in updates.Â  Another use on a per game basis is when a developer analyzes the numbers of players dropping out after a certain level.Â  The developer would use this information to look at the design of their game and re-assess if the game challenge is truly intuitive or needs some additional instruction for players.Â  This allows the developer to enhance the experience and retain the developerâs customers better.</p><p>Some Unity developers may collect your information independent of Unity. Unity does not have control over this information. If you want to request access to or deletion of this information, then check each developerâs app settings or website for instructions on how to make a request.</p><h3>I play a game that uses Unity Analytics, what do I need to know?</h3><p>Unity has collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, as well as events completed or actions taken within the game, including level, number of credits, time it took you to earn them, metadata about in-game communications and the value and details of purchases. Using our systems, the developer of the game has ongoing access to this data. This collection and use of data makes it possible for your experience to operate as expected by permitting you to doÂ things like redeem rewards you have earned or return to where you left off in a game. Other Unity customers may have access to aggregated reports about game activity in general across a number of games. These reports are based, in part, on your game activities, but do not specifically identify you or your device. The reports described in this paragraph help developers make decisions on optimal methods to run the games they have made for you. For example, the developer may need to know the types of devices running the game to determine how to support game updates on an ongoing basis.Â Some data collected by Unity Analytics may be used by Unity Ads for personalized advertising; see the FAQs related to advertising for more information.</p><h3>I received an ad from Unity Ads, what do I need to know?</h3><p>Unity Ads has probably collected device information, like IP address and device identifiers, and information regarding the delivery of ads and your interaction with them, all of which may be shared with ad publishers and attribution companies. For clarity, Unity collects the following data: whether you click or tap an ad for a new game, whether you watch the ad or play a game frequently, whether others playing a game like the one youâre playing have downloaded a particular new game, and whether you download and install the new game you see advertised. All of this is for purposes of predicting the types of new games that you might like to download. Unity may track additional data about you in the future for purposes of making these types of predictions, and we will notify you prior to new data collection.</p><h3>Do I have any choices regarding the data collection described above if I do not wish to see personalized ads?</h3><p>If you are in the EU and do not wish to be targeted in this manner, the first Unity ad you see in an app (as of May 25, 2018) explains how you can opt-out of data collection in that particular game. You can opt-out then or at any time by clicking or tapping the ââ¹â button (or Data Privacy icon) on any ad you see (the ââ¹â button or Data Privacy icon will also allow you to access the data that is collected about you in that particular app). For example, you might see a summaryÂ  Â that includes information indicating thatÂ  we see that you are using an iPhone 8 and you are playing from Germany. In the past week weâve seen you 5 times in this game and have shown you 27 ads. You have installed 0 games based on those ads.</p><p>(Additionally, all users, regardless of their location, may opt-out of all personalized advertising by enabling privacy features on their devices such as Limit Ad Tracking (iOS) and Opt Out of Ads Personalization (Android). See your deviceâs Help system for more information.)</p><p>Also, you may see certain âbrandâ advertising within our ad network (a brand ad is advertising for products that are not games, such as ads for an airline travel deal or a soft drink). Unity gets these ads from third-party networks. We do not permit these third parties to add your app usage to their marketing database, except for a few exceptions, which we specifically list in the Advertising Choices section of our Privacy Policy. The small subset of third parties listed are clearly noted as being permitted by our contracts to use the fact that you play a particular game in their future targeting of ads to you for other non-Unity parties. Â The remaining parties listed have been clearly noted as not permitted to maintain data about the ad they served you through the Unity network for future use.Â  Please note that if you have told Unity not to target you or you have exercised choices directly with these third parties as described in our Advertising Choices section, this information will not be maintained or used by us or these third parties. Please note that if you have elected to not have your data collected by Unity, we do not send your advertising identifier to any third party, and you will receive only contextual advertising inside our network. You may also visit the third parties listed in our Privacy Policy (at the links we provide) to see the types of data that these parties have about you based on your deviceâs advertising identifier. Please review the section âWhat are my privacy choices for advertising?â below to learn more about how to exercise choice with regard to personalized ads.</p><h3>I play a game that uses Unity Multiplayer, what do I need to know?</h3><p>Unity has collected unique device identifiers, IP address (which may be matched to identify approximate location for matchmaking), as well as information regarding games played and match attributes.</p><h3>What are device identifiers (like IDFA or fingerprints) and why do you collect them?</h3><p>Like many other providers of mobile apps, instead of requiring users to create an account and log in to it each time they access one of our apps, Unity and others using our products may opt to recognize the userâs device through various device identifiers. Device identifiers are also used for functions that require Unity to recognize devices across various apps.</p><h3>I use Unityâs game replay service (Everyplay), what do I need to know?</h3><p>A: Unity has probably collected unique device identifiers and your IP address as well as your activity within the service. If you have created an account with Unityâs game replay service, Unity has received any information you actively provided when setting up your account, including email address and username. Our primary use of your data will be provision of the game replay platform and all its features, including analysis and improvement. You can access and update your account info by visiting <a href="https://everyplay.com/">Everyplay</a> and navigating to the user settings page. Also:</p><ul><li><p>When you create an account or profile your username, profile photo, cover photo, user description, users that you follow and users that follow you will all be public, which means that anyone can see that information and we, as well as others, may share it.</p></li><li><p>Replays that are set to public will be viewable by anyone AND the service or the relevant Developer may use the replay to promote the service or the relevant game.</p></li><li><p>When you comment on, share or like a replay using the Unity game replay platform, your replay, including any audio or video narration you attached to the replay, like or comments will be visible to others.</p></li><li><p>When you share a replay on a social network - depending on your privacy settings on that social network, some users of that social network will see the replay.</p></li></ul><h3>I sell assets in the Unity Asset Store. What do I need to know?</h3><p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your placement of assets in the store and to ensure that you are paid in accordance with our agreement. Other uses might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store. You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting the Publisher Administration page. Also, when you publish or provide assets for licenses on the Asset Store, your seller name and other information in your Publisher profile will be visible.</p><h3>I bought an asset in the Unity Asset Store. What should I know?</h3><p>Unity has collected information about your device, including IP address, and your use of the Asset Store as well as any information you actively provided when you created your account. Our primary uses of your information will be to facilitate your access to the Asset Store and any assets you have purchased as well as to assure our developers selling assets on the Asset Store that we are effectively providing them due compensation.</p><p>Other uses of this information might include sending you updates on changes or promotions in the Asset Store. You can access and update your account info by logging in to the Asset Store and visiting your My Account page. You can also adjust your settings to limit the types of marketing materials we send you or to remove your consent for receiving any advertising from Unity.</p><h2>2. Privacy Policy Overview</h2><p>Unity Technologies and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively âUnityâ) offer a variety of products and services for game Developers and game players that will be referred to in this policy as the âServiceâ or âServices.â Because we would like to avoid excessive formality and make this information easy to understand, the policy refers to Unity as âweâ or âusâ and to the reader as âyou.â When we say âdevice,â we mean any device, including desktop, laptop, PC or Mac computers, smartphones, tablets, or any other device that is used to access or interact with the Service. When we say âDeveloper,â we mean a third party that develops and/or distributes a game or other app made with Unity software and/or a game using Unity Services. By using the Service, you agree to this Privacy Policy and understand that we may transfer your data outside of the European Economic Area (EEA).</p><p>This Privacy Policy governs our information practices for the Service, which includes any websites, where a link to this policy is provided. It describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information from Developers, players, ad recipients, or people browsing or using our sites (collectively âUsersâ) when Users access or interact with or use our Service.

Please note that we can use our own logging and tracking to understand use of our sites that do not make use of Google Analytics, and your use of their browser add-on will not impact that tracking.</p></li><li><p>We use Twitterâs ad platform to bring you more useful and interesting advertising content. If you are on the web, you can visit the Digital Advertising Allianceâs (DAA) consumer choice tool atÂ <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/">optout.aboutads.info</a>Â to opt out of interest-based advertising from Twitter in your current browser.

Transfers out of Country of Collection</h2><ul><li>Unity has implemented and maintains a framework consistent with applicable law for transfers of data outside of the country of collection, including for transfers out of the EEA.</li><li>Your Personal Information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the Services you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country.Â  In certain circumstances, courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies or security authorities in those other countries may be entitled to access your Personal Information. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE EEA: Some of the non-EEA countries are recognized by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection according to EEA standards (the full list of these countries is available at:Â Â <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en" target="_blank">https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en</a>). For transfers from the EEA to countries not considered adequate by the European Commission, we have put in place adequate measures, such as standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission to protect your Personal Information. You may obtain a copy of these measures by contactingÂ <a href="mailto:DPO@unity3d.com">DPO@unity3d.com</a>.</li><li>We retain Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law.Â </li></ul><h2>10.

These measures vary based on the sensitivity of the information that we collect, process, and store, and the current state of technology. Please note that no system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information.</p><h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2><p>We reserve the right to change our practices and this policy at any time. We may also send an email or provide notice within some or all of our offerings when this policy changes.

Cookie Policy</h2><h3>What are cookies?</h3><p>Cookies are pieces of data that sites and services you use or visit can set on your browser or device and they can typically be read on future visits to learn more about the User and to personalize an experience, including the ads that are displayed to the User. âCookiesâ is also a term that may be used to refer to a range of technologies that help an operator identify Users and devices, which in turn can help personalize an experience, prevent fraud, store preferences, and speed up delivery of content.</p><h3>How does Unity use cookies?</h3><p>Unity may employ cookies and related technologies described below for a variety of purposes, including:</p><ul><li>To learn more about how our products and Services are used and similar analytical purposes;</li><li>To understand how Users interact with our ads;</li><li>To understand how to improve performance;</li><li>To prevent fraud;</li><li>To customize our products and Services with more relevant content; and</li><li>To provide you with more relevant advertising.</li></ul><p>For example, we might use a web beacon to learn whether an email message was opened or we might store preferences in a Flash cookie (see below for more information).</p><h3>What types of cookies and other technologies does Unity use?</h3><p>As described below, Unity employs a number of technologies to provide and improve the Service. When you use the Service, you consent to our use of these technologies, but you are welcome to exercise the choices described below.</p><ul><li><em>Browser cookies:</em> Unity uses browser cookies. Most major browser companies offer tools or settings for Users who do not want cookies set or read on their devices. Please visit your browserâs settings or privacy settings pages.</li><li><em>Local shared objects:</em> Unity may use local shared objects (also known as Flash cookies) on its sites.

Thus, you may not have a choice to prevent advertisements from being presented when using the Services; however, you do have choices to limit personalized advertisements that are tailored to your interests.</p><p>If Unity delivers personalized advertising, Unity will provide notice and information about how you may be able to opt-out of such personalized advertisements. Such opportunity to opt out may occur through your device settings (see the section âInformation and choices regarding tracking and targeting on mobile devicesâ below) and the choices available within the ad unit as described in this policy by accessing the ââ¹â button or Data Privacy icon in the ad unit.</p><p>Developers may use other third-party advertising networks, and Unityâs choice features within its ad units only apply to ads delivered in the Unity network. If you do not wish to receive personalized advertising that is delivered by third parties, you may be able to exercise that choice through opt-out programs that are administered by third parties, including the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), and/or the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EIDAA). Where applicable, you may exercise your opt-out choices at theÂ <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">NAI website</a>, theÂ <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">DAA website</a>, or theÂ <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">EIDAA website</a>.

We may use the following features based on Google Analytics for Display Advertising: Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. To opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising or customize Google Display Network ads, you can visit theÂ <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads">Google Ads Settings page</a>.</p><p>More choices regarding browser cookies and beacons and other tracking technologies</p><p>There are several browser plugins available to Users who want to be better informed about and have more control over the use of cookies and related technologies on their devices.

Unity does not control your device-level opt-out processes and is not responsible for any choices you make through such a mechanism or for the continued availability, accuracy, effectiveness, or location of that mechanism. Using a device-level opt-out mechanism may opt you out of all third-party personalized advertisements, not just those delivered by Unity.</li><li>If you use an Apple device, goÂ <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4228">here</a>.</li><li>If you use an Android device, navigate to the Google Settings page, select Ads and then choose to reset your Android Ad ID or opt-out of personalized ads.</li><li>To learn about options for many mobile ad networks, goÂ <a href="http://www.applicationprivacy.org/expressing-your-behavioral-advertising-choices-on-a-mobile-device/">here</a>.</li></ul><h3>Unity Adâs Partners in Providing Advertising for Goods and Services</h3><p>Please note that the Developer of the app showing Unity Ads may have limited providing certain identifying information, including your device advertising ID, about you to our third-party partners advertising goods and services (non-game advertisements) with Unity.Â  If that is the case, you will see an affirmative statement to that effect when you view the information inside of a Unity Ad through the âiâ button or Data privacy icon inside of your app. Â You may still see ads from the partners listed below, but they will not be based on your personal data. Â Additionally, you may have opted-out of profiling in Unityâs ad network within a Unity Ad for your app, and we will only serve contextual ads from ourselves and these partners within your app. For all others, please review the following information:</p><h3><strong>Controller Partners</strong></h3><p>The following partners may receive an ad request from Unity containing your advertising ID, IP address, and the name of the app/game in which you will see the ad.Â  These partners use this information to serve future ads you may see on the internet as well as inside the Unity ad network.Â  The privacy policies linked below provide you information around the data that they have from all sources, including Unity, and your rights to delete or remove data.Â </p><p>Googleâs AdMobÂ  <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>Â  (Review the link to AdSettings)</p><p>MediaMath-- <a href="http://www.mediamath.com/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">http://www.mediamath.com/privacy-policy/</a></p><h3>Processor Partners</h3><p>The following partners may receive an ad request containing your advertising ID, IP Address, and the name of the game in which you will see the ad.Â  These partners act as processors to Unity and <strong>are not permitted </strong>to use this information for any further purpose, including serving you future ads.Â  The privacy policies linked below provide you information around the data that they have from sources other than Unity:</p><p><a href="http://corp.aarki.com/privacy">Aarki</a>, <a href="https://www.adcolony.com/gdpr/">AdColony</a>, <a href="http://www.ad.net/privacy-policy">Ad.Net</a>, <a href="http://www.admaxim.com/admaxim-privacy-policy/">AdMaxim</a>, <a href="https://appreciate.mobi/page.html#/end-user-privacy-policy">Appreciate</a>, Â <a href="http://beeswax.com/privacy.html">Beeswax</a>, <a href="http://www.crossinstall.com/privacy/">CrossInstall</a>, <a href="https://gothamads.com/privacy-policy">GothamAds</a>, <a href="http://lifestreet.com/privacy/">Lifestreet</a>, <a href="https://www.manage.com/privacy-policy/">Manage.com</a>, <a href="http://www.molocoads.com/private-policy.html">Moloco</a>, <a href="http://persona.ly/privacy_dsp">Persona.ly</a>, <a href="https://www.receptiv.com/ad-services-privacy-policy">Receptiv</a>, and <a href="https://remerge.io/privacy-policy.html">Remerge</a>.</p>							</div>
