								<span>When completing a form on our website, when signing up for a Crunch Account, or at times during the course of your subscription with Crunch we ask you to provide information about your business, or the business you intend to form, along with any previous trading information.</span> <span>We may also request other personal details such as your marital status, date of birth, National Insurance No., telephone number, etc.</span>
							</p>

								<span>Any data entered via online forms/surveys, or directly into your Crunch Account is protected with SSL Encryption Certificates (secure socket layer technology) issued by leading certificate authorities Verisign or Go Daddy.

								<span>However, the Internet is not in itself a secure environment. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, users should only enter, or import data within a secure environment.

								<span>First party cookies are created by Crunch whilst third party cookies are created by affiliates or tracking services.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Google Analytics<sup>TM</sup>- a third party tracking service collects information about how our website is used. We use information to report on usage and volume statistics. We have no access to or control over these cookies.</span>

Cookies originating from Adwords also give us power to serve ads on the Google network specifically to people who have already visited our site and not signed up.</span>
							</p>
							<p>
								<span>You can also opt-out of a number of targeted advertising cookies by visiting these opt-out pages:</span> <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/"><span>National Advertising Initiative</span></a> <span>and</span> <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/?hl=en"><span>Google</span></a><span>.

								<span>Visual Website Optimizer - From time to time we like to run tests on our site with a view to improving the user experience. VWO is a suite of testing tools that track a user's activity in a very particular way for the purpose of a test. This may be checking how far a group of users scroll down a page, splitting users into groups to view similar but different pages and so on.</span>

								<span>Desk - a third party customer support platform, which uses cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Help section.</span>

							</p>
							<p>
								<span>Crunch also utilises Facebook to identify their users who may be similar to Crunch users. This is done through an anonymous and encrypted process. User data is provided by Crunch and once a ‘lookalike’ audience of Facebook users is created the data provided by Crunch is deleted.
