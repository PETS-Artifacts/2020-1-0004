<h3>Databases:</h3>
<p>The National Chemical Database Service (NCDS) is a portal to allow access to third-party databases. We have contracts with&nbsp;Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC)&nbsp;to host the service and with third-party providers to license the databases. We do not send your personal information to EPSRC or the third-party providers.</p>
<p>Your personal data is only used for operational purposes (such as sending service messages or resetting forgotten passwords) unless you have opted in to receive marketing messages.</p>
<p>It is necessary for us to gather evidence of the scientific impact of the NCDS to secure continued funding. Therefore we may occasionally contact registered NCDS users about their use of the service.</p>
<h3>Journals:</h3>
<p>Authors submit their manuscript and personal details via online submission and peer review systems.</p>
<p>If a manuscript is accepted the files will be transferred to our Production system, including your personal information.</p>
<p>We may use your personal information to contact you to invite you to serve as a peer reviewer. We will refrain from doing this if you inform us that you do not want to take part in such activity.</p>
<p>Your personal information may be included in our internal tracking and archiving processes.</p>
<p>If you provide us with your personal data, we will ask you if you would like to receive information from us about our other activities, products and services. If you choose to opt-in to receiving this information then we may contact you regarding journal news, journal symposia, Themed Issues, nominations for lectureships and awards. You will not be automatically opted-in and if you do opt-in you can opt-out at any time.</p>

<h2>Profiling and automated decision making</h2>
<p>RSC does itself carry out automated decision making or profiling. We will share email addresses, which have been given directly to RSC by data subjects, or browsing information, &nbsp;&nbsp;obtained in ways such as pixel tracking, to enable us to show tailored adverts on a third party platform, such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google, whom may perform profiling.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Film and Video</h2>
<p>We have a procedure in place in relation to our use of images through use of photographs and video, including process for consent to use (as applicable), retention and deletion. For more information please contact our Data Protection Officer at the address shown above.</p>
<p><b>CCTV at Thomas Graham House or Burlington House</b></p>
<p>RSC operates use of CCTV surveillance cameras at these offices. Surveillance is monitored through a live feed by RSC staff within our Facilities Management and Hospitality teams. Off-site/remote access to surveillance footage is only granted to our staff and is provided securely through our IT system, subject to our off-site working practices and policies. Surveillance cameras are located in public access areas such as meeting rooms, post rooms, corridors, cafes, canteens, libraries, stairs, lifts, reception areas and fire exits. Surveillance cameras on these sites record images only; there is no recording of sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our staff will have 24 hour access to the surveillance feeds and may access them during out of office hours in the case of an emergency, incident or alarm activation at our sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surveillance footage is stored securely for a period of 60 (sixty) days in our UK based servers, after which time the surveillance footage is automatically deleted.</p>
<p>In the event of an incident or accident at either site, the footage may be downloaded by our staff and stored securely on our UK based servers in the interests of preserving evidence for any potential investigation and/or claim(s). Any such downloaded footage may also be shared with the relevant authorities, including the Police, where we are required to do so by law. We may retain footage that is downloaded and/or stored for these purposes for a period up to 6 (six) years to take into account the statutory limitation periods for any potential investigation(s) and claim(s). Once any potential investigation(s) or claim(s) has concluded, we will delete the relevant footage.</p>
<p>Access to the surveillance footage is limited to our staff and those third party contractors that are required to perform maintenance and servicing of the surveillance camera equipment, including ADT Fire and Security PLC (“ADT”). ADT are our chosen third party contractors for this service at both sites, however, alternative third party contractors in the same industry may be used by us to maintain and service our surveillance camera equipment in the event of an emergency or a change in our requirements. ADT, or any such third party contractor, will not have access to the surveillance footage off-site/remotely.</p>

<h2>International transfer</h2>
<p>The Royal Society of Chemistry is a global organisation with subsidiary companies located around the world. This Notice establishes our global principles for the collection, use and disclosure of information gathered through our websites and applications. The country in which you are doing business with us or where the website you are visiting is located/hosted may have specific requirements concerning personal information.</p>
<p>The data that we collect from you may be stored in a location outside of the European Economic Area. Where we transfer your personal information outside of the EEA, we ensure it is protected by making sure at least one of the following safeguards is in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>by transferring your personal information to a country that has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection by the European Commission;</li>
<li>by using specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give your personal information the same protection it has within the EEA; or</li>
<li>we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have not set out the specific circumstances when each of these protection measures are used. You can contact us at <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="mailto:DPO@rsc.org">DPO@rsc.org</a></span> for the details as to how we protect specific transfer of your data.</p>

<h2>Children’s Data</h2>
<p>We recognise any individual under the age of 18 years old as being a child. We take safeguarding of children (including the protection of their personal data) seriously and will take all reasonable steps to ensure that children are provided with sufficiently clear information on how we will collect, process and store their personal data, and that children&nbsp;and their guardians understand the nature of the processing of their personal data together with their rights in respect of the same.</p>
<p>Children below the age of 13 years old will always require the consent of an adult with parental responsibility to provide personal data to, and consent to the processing of that data with us.</p>
<p>Save for photography and filming, children between the ages of 13 years old and 18 years old may be able to provide consent in their own right to the processing of their personal data depending on their maturity and ability to understand the nature of the processing of that data. We will take reasonable steps to assess a child’s maturity and ability to understand the nature of data processing before determining whether a child can reasonably consent to processing in their own right. Further information on how we will assess a child’s ability to consent in their own right can be supplied on request via our contact details above.</p>
