<h3 align="left">Information Relating to Children</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) was passed by the U.S. Congress in November 1998.

The MyPlayCity Website and any Products or Services available on that site are not directed at children under 13 years of age and, therefore, COPPA does not apply.

Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our users.

<h3 align="left">C. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>
<h3 align="left">How your personal information is used</h2>

Without your consent, MyPlayCity will not communicate any information to you regarding Products, Services, and special offers available from MyPlayCity or its affiliates, although we may find it necessary to communicate with you regarding your use of the Services on this Website.  Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, MyPlayCity will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.</p>
<h3 align="left">Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">Although we will always strive to guard your identity, we may disclose your personally identifiable information without your permission in limited circumstances.  We will only do so if we have a good-faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with laws, regulations, or government requests or (2) to investigate or protect against harmful activities to our guests, visitors, associates, or property (including the Website), or to others. <strong> </strong>If we are required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide your personally identifiable information, we will only do so upon receipt of appropriate documentation.  We may also disclose your information to investigate violation of and enforce our Terms of Use.  Please know that we do not take this responsibility lightly.  Your privacy is of paramount importance to us.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">MyPlayCity does use the services of third parties, such as e-mail service providers, purchase, shipping and order processing merchants and marketing companies that act as independent contractors on behalf of MyPlayCity.  These parties are contractually prohibited from using personally identifiable information for any purpose other than for the purpose MYPLAYCITY specifies.  We do provide non-personally identifiable information to certain service providers for their use on an aggregated basis for the purpose of performing their contractual obligations to us.  We prohibit the sale or transfer of personal information to entities outside of the MyPlayCity's affiliates for their use without your approval.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">In the event that all or substantially all of MyPlayCity's stock and/or all or substantially all assets are transferred or sold to another entity, MyPlayCity may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity.  If, as a result of such a business transition, your personally identifiable information will be used in a materially different manner, you will be given choice consistent with our policy regarding notification of changes.</p>
<h3 align="left">Choices available to you</h2>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">You can always choose whether or not to disclose personally identifiable information and that choice will not prevent you from using the MyPlayCity Website. Please note, however, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with some of the Services dependent upon the collection of this information and you will be given an opportunity to "opt-in" and make your preference choices for any items that are optional and which are not prerequisite for our rendering such Services.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">You can choose at anytime to opt out of receiving emails from MyPlayCity or from having your personally identifiable information shared with selected companies. If you want to opt out, you can do so by editing your preferences with respect to email or the sharing of information. If you elect to "opt out" we will not, as applicable, share your personal information with third parties or send you emails.  However, we may continue to use your personal information for internal purposes, to enhance your user experience or as necessary to administer the site or comply with applicable law.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">We reserve the right to send a one-time registration confirmation email, and infrequent Service Alert messages to users to inform them of specific changes that may impact their ability to use a service they have previously signed up for, regardless of email contact opt-in status.  We also reserve the right to contact you if compelled to do so as part of a legal proceeding or if there has been a violation of any applicable licensing, warranty and purchase agreements.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">MyPlayCity is retaining these rights because in limited cases we feel that we may need the right to contact you as a matter of law or regarding matters that will be important to you. These rights do not allow us to contact you to market a new or existing Service if you have asked us not to do so, and issuance of these types of communications is rare.</p>
<p style="font-size:12px;line-height:20px;text-align:justify;">If you wish to opt out of receiving emails, the sharing or retention of any personal identification information, or otherwise change your personal preferences, you must contact MyPlayCity at: <a class="ublue" href="http://www.myplaycity.com/support/">www.myplaycity.com/support</a>.</p>

The information we require is your full name, address and the email address you provided to MyPlayCity when you requested Services or Products.   MyPlayCity reserves the right to contact you to verify that we have accurately identified your record.</p>
