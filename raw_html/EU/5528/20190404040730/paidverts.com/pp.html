                    <li>This statement contains numerous general and technical details about the
            steps we take to respect your privacy concerns. The bottom line is that
            meeting your needs and expectations form the foundation of everything we do

                Cookies                <ul>
                    <li>Our website uses cookie technology. Cookies are strings of text that a
            website may store on a user's computer. Our website uses cookies but only
            requires them in the online reservation process. Cookies enable our website
            to keep track of your preferences and activities relating to the website.
            Our website creates session cookies for each visit in order to facilitate
            your visit. The session cookie expires at the end of the session.</li>
                    <li>Use of Cookies and E-Mails - We use a third party service provider
                    to send marketing e-mails on behalf of PAIDVERTS. There are no
                    cookies in the e-mail. However, when an e-mail recipient clicks on
                    a link to The PAIDVERTS website included in the e-mail, a
                    persistent cookie is placed on the user's computer. This cookie is
                    used to measure the effectiveness of our e-mail marketing efforts
                    and better understand how our users navigate through the site. The
                    cookie set by our service provider will remain on your hard drive
                    30 days after the last time you clicked on the coded link in the
                    e-mail, or until you delete it.</li>
                    <li>Use of Cookies for Advertising - We use third party service
                    providers to serve and host our advertisements. These third parties
                    use persistent cookies to track the number of times our site is
                    accessed and whether the site was accessed from the advertisement.
                    The cookies generated from the advertisements do not contain
                    personally identifiable information and may remain on your hard
                    drive three or more years unless deleted by you.</li>
                    <li>The third party service providers mentioned above are contractually bound
            not to use any information they gather for any purpose other than providing
            services to us. Cookies do not corrupt or damage your computer or computer
            files. In addition, we do not use cookies to gather information concerning
            your visits to non-PAIDVERTS websites. If you do not wish to receive these
            cookies, you may set your browser to reject the cookies (consult the
            instructions for your particular browser on how to do this), although doing
            so may affect your ability to perform certain transactions on our website.</li>

                Pixel Tags                <ul>
                    <li>The third party service providers mentioned above serve and host PAIDVERTS
            advertisements on other sites. To track the effectiveness of PAIDVERTS
            advertisements on other sites, Paiverts.comuses pixel tags (also known as
            clear gifs, beacon gifs, 1-by-1 gifs, or web bugs). Pixel tags are not
            visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer
            coding. If you are visiting Paiverts.com from an advertisement on another
            site, the pixel tag references the cookie you received when you clicked on
            the advertisement. The pixel tag then registers this activity with the
            third party advertising company to allow us to count the number of times an
            advertisement is accessed. In addition, we also measure the reservations
            generated from a particular ad. At no time is personally identifiable
            information about you or your reservation collected by the third party
            advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the
            pixel tag allowed to be used by them for any other purpose other than to
            report website activity to us or allow us to better target future
            interactive advertising.</li>
                    <li>Our third party service providers may use pixel tags in PAIDVERTS marketing
            e-mails that help us send the e-mail in a format you can read, to allow us
            to know which e-mails you act upon and to better target the content of
            future e-mails. In addition, we track the aggregate number of e-mails read
            and whether any of the links in the e-mail were accessed. No other
            information is collected or used from pixel tags.</li>
                </ul>

                Information We Collect                <ul>
                    <li>When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you, we
            will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. For
            example, if you would like to create a PAIDVERTS account or receive
            information regarding upcoming PAIDVERTS technological advances, we will
            ask you for information such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail
            address, and quite possibly credit card number. We will use your e-mail
            address to send a confirmation and, if necessary, might use the other
            information to contact you for help to process the reservation. The same
            types of information may would be requested to complete any other
            membership related activity. As indicated below (see E-Mail section), we
            may also use your e-mail address to notify you about special offers and
            promotions.</li>

                    <li>It is our intention to only send you e-mail communications that will be
            useful to you and that you want to receive. When you make a reservation and
            provide your e-mail address, we will occasionally contact you via e-mail
            and provide information about special offers and promotions that may be of
            interest to you. These communications will relate to PAIDVERTS offers
            and/or the promotions of select, reputable third parties with whom
            PAIDVERTS has a strategic marketing relationship because they offer
            products or services that we believe would of interest to you. We use a
            third party e-mail service provider to send e-mails. This service provider
            is prohibited from using your e-mail address for any purpose other than to
            send PAIDVERTS related e-mail. Every time you receive e-mail you will be
            provided the choice to opt-out of future e-mails by following the
            instructions provided in the e-mail, or you may opt-out by updating your
            online profile.</li>
