We may provide additional or more specific information on the collection or use of personal information on websites or related to a specific product or service.</p>&#10;&#10;<h2 class="ibm-bold">Why and how we collect and use your personal information</h2>&#10;&#10;<p>We may collect your personal information as an individual for various purposes, such as the following:</p>&#10;&#10;<ul class="ibm-bullet-list">&#10;<li><b>Access and use of websites or other online services</b>&#10;<br />When entering one of our websites, or using an online service, we will record information necessary to provide you with access, for the operation of the website and for us to comply with security and legal requirements in relation to operating our site, such as passwords, IP address and browser settings.

For instance, we collect your name and contact information, details about your request and your agreement with us and the fulfillment, delivery and invoicing of your order and we may include client satisfaction survey information. We retain such information for administrative purposes, defending our rights, and in connection with our relationship with you.&#10;<br />&#10;<br />When you provide your name and contact information to register in connection with such a request, the registration may serve to identify you when you visit our websites. For ordering of most services and products we require you to have registered an IBMid. Registration may also allow you to customize and control your privacy settings.</li>&#10;<li><b>Your use of IBM Cloud services</b>&#10;<br />We collect information about your use of IBM Cloud services to enable product features to operate, improve your user experience, tailor our interactions with you, inform our clients on the overall use of the services, provide support and improve and develop our products and services. For details regarding the technologies we employ, the personal information we collect, as well as how to control or block tracking or to delete cookies, please refer to the <a href="/privacy/details/us/en/">IBM Online Privacy Statement</a>.</li>&#10;<li><b>Contacting employees of our clients, prospects, partners and suppliers</b>&#10;<br />In our relationship with clients or prospects, partners and suppliers, they also provide us with business contact information (such as name, business contact details, position or title of their employees, contractors, advisors and authorized users) for purposes such as contract management, fulfillment, delivery of products and services, provision of support, invoicing and management of the services or the relationship.</li>&#10;<li><b>Visitor information</b>&#10;<br />We register individuals visiting our sites and locations (name, identification and business contact information) and use camera supervision for reasons of security and safety of persons and belongings, as well as for regulatory purposes.</li>&#10;<li><b>Marketing</b>&#10;<br />Most information we collect about you comes from our direct interactions with you. When you register for an event we may collect information (online or offline) in relation to the event organization, and during an event, such as participation in sessions and survey results. We combine the personal information we collect to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence for conducting our business and for marketing purposes. You can choose to receive information by email, telephone or postal mail about our products and services, or sign-up for subscriptions. When visiting our websites or using our services we may provide you with personalized information.

When we collect and use your personal information subject to the EU Privacy Legislation this may have consequences for <a href="#your_rights">Your Rights</a>.</p>&#10;&#10;<h2 class="ibm-bold">Sharing of Personal Information</h2>&#10;&#10;<p>As a global organization offering a wide range of products and services, with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders, IBM has implemented global policies, along with standards and procedures, for consistent protection of personal information. As a global company, we may share information about you with our subsidiaries world-wide and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in accordance with this Privacy Statement.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>Between IBM controlled subsidiaries we only grant access to personal information on a need-to-know basis, necessary for the purposes for which such access is granted. In some cases, IBM uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process personal information on its behalf.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>Where appropriate, IBM may also share your personal information with selected partners to help us provide you, or the company you work for, products or services, or to fulfill your requests, or with your consent. When selecting our suppliers and partners, we take into account their data handling processes.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>If IBM decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries, such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is IBM&#39;s practice to require appropriate protection for personal information in these types of transactions.</p>&#10;&#10;<p>Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your personal information to protect the rights or property of IBM, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected.</p>&#10;&#10;<h2 class="ibm-bold">International Transfers</h2>&#10;&#10;<p>The international footprint of IBM involves a large number of transfers of personal information between different subsidiaries, as well as to third parties located in the countries where we do business. Some countries have implemented transfer restrictions for personal information, in connection with which IBM takes various measures, including:</p>&#10;&#10;<ul class="ibm-bullet-list">&#10;<li>Where required, IBM implements Standard Contractual Clauses approved by the EU Commission, or similar contractual clauses in other jurisdictions. This includes transfers to suppliers or other third parties. You can request a copy of the EU Standard Contractual Clauses <a href="https://www.ibm.com/scripts/contact/contact/us/en/privacy/">here</a>.</li>&#10;<li>IBM certified to the <a class="ibm-external-link ibm-inlinelink ibm-icon-after" data-widget="leavingibm" href="/www.ibm.com/links/?us=fr&#38;en=fr&#38;prompt=1&#38;url=http://www.cbprs.org">APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules</a>.</li>&#10;<li>IBM certified to the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.
