        to a network such as the internet, enabling such devices to communicate.</p>
    <h5>How we use IP addresses</h5>

        <li>We record the IP address of visitors to our website and we collect related information such as the products viewed
            or searched for, the length of visits to certain pages and page interaction.</li>
        <li>We use an independent company to collate the information described above. This company then provides us with data
            relating to website visitors that have accessed our website from businesses.</li>
        <li>We may then use this information to provide potential business customers with details of services that we offer.</li>
    </ul>

        you choose to provide it – the survey can be completed anonymously. The data collected by ForeSee is hosted in the
        United States and the transfer of data is protected using the European Commission’s standard data protection clauses
        or under the EU recognised Privacy Shield arrangements.</p>
    <p>Only a small percentage of visitors will be asked to undertake the survey. If you don’t want to take part, please close
        the pop-up window invite and you can continue with your browsing.</p>
    <p>If you choose to take the survey:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a session cookie will be placed on your computer so that Foresee can communicate with you during the survey. This
            cookie will be deleted when you close your browser; and</li>
        <li>• a persistent cookie will be placed on your computer which helps Foresee to ensure that you won’t be asked to complete

        not sell or disclose to third parties any personal data gathered from the surveys. For full details of how Foresee

        regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">Data Retention</h4> - How Long Will You Use My Personal Data For?
    <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including
        for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the
        personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes
        for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable
        legal requirements.</p>
    <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction
        Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research
        or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">Keeping your information</h4>
    <p>We’ll hold on to your information for as long as you have your account, or as long as is needed to be able to provide
        the services to you, or (in the case of any contact you may have with our Customer Care team) for as long as is necessary
        to provide support-related reporting and trend analysis only.</p>
    <p>If reasonably necessary or required to meet legal or regulatory requirements, resolve disputes, prevent fraud and abuse,
        or enforce our terms and conditions, we may also keep hold of some of your information as required, even after you
        have closed your account or it is no longer needed to provide the services to you.</p>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">Your Legal Rights</h4>
    <p>You have a lot of rights relating to your personal information. You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Request Access</strong> - The right to access the personal information we hold about you. This enables you to
            receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Request Correction</strong> - The right to request the correction of inaccurate personal information we hold
            about you (although you can probably do most of this through your Account)</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Request Deletion</strong> - The right to request that we delete your data, or stop processing it or collecting
            it, in some circumstances where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right
            to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where
            we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be
            able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable,
            at the time of your request. </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Request Transfer</strong> - The right to request that we transfer or port elements of your data either to you
            or another service provider. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in
            a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information
            which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with
            you.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Object to processing</strong> where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there
            is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you
            feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling
            legitimate grounds to process your information which overrides your rights and freedoms.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> - This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal
            data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the
            data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
            require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use
            of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
        <li>
            <strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
            this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw
            your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is
            the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
            <li>Where you receive direct marketing messages from Hermes, you can withdraw your consent directly via the ‘Unsubscribe’
                link in the email or via your Account Settings.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">No Fee Usually Required</h4>
    <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may
        charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse
        to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">What We May Need From You</h4>
    <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access
        your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal
        data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
        information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

    <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-double">Time Limit to Respond</h4>
    <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your
        request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep
        you updated.</p>
