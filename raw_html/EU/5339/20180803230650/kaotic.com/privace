<h2>KAOTIC.COM Terms Of Service</h2>


By using and/or visiting the KAOTIC.COM website (collectively, including all Content and User Submissions available through this website, the "Website"), you agree to these Terms of Service. These terms of service, including the KAOTIC.COM Privacy Policy, which is incorporated herein, and any future amendments (collectively, the "Agreement"), constitute a legal agreement between KAOTIC.COM ("KAOTIC.COM") and you. By clicking the agree button below, you agree to be bound by all of these terms. If you do not agree to be bound by all of these terms, then do not use this site.
<br><br>
KAOTIC.COM may, in its sole discretion, modify or revise these terms and conditions and policies at any time, and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. If you do not accept and abide by this Agreement, you may not use the Website.
<br><br>
<b>1. Description of Service.</b>
<br><br>
KAOTIC.COM is a website that makes available to its viewers content generated by third-parties. The website is a resource for people who want to share and who are looking for, among other things, visual depictions of adult content, including sexually explicit images. Visitors to the website can also "rate" the content they view on a scale of 1 through 5. (Collectively, "KAOTIC.COM's Services.")
<br><br>
Among other things, KAOTIC.COM provides a platform for uploading, sharing, and viewing various types of content. KAOTIC.COM's dynamic and collaborative service enables registered and unregistered users (visitors and registered members are collectively referred to as "User(s)") to access a host of functionality, including but not limited to various types of media submitted by Users (collectively, "User Submissions").
<br><br>
This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of the Website. By agreeing to these Terms of Use, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a "Visitor" (which means that you simply browse the KAOTIC.COM Website) or you are a "Member" (which means that you have registered with KAOTIC.COM). You are only authorized to use KAOTIC.COM's Services if you agree to abide by all applicable laws and to this Agreement. Please read this Agreement carefully and save it.
<br><br>
KAOTIC.COM grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited, and revocable license to view the Content and Website subject to the terms of this Agreement. You may access, transfer, or use the Website on such software, personal computers, and/or devices as authorized by us or our content delivery providers.
<br><br>
<b>2. Use.</b>
<br><br>
Use of and membership in the KAOTIC.COM Website is void where prohibited.
<br><br>
The Website is made available to you for your personal use only and may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavors except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by KAOTIC.COM.

Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, and other forms of solicitation may be removed from Member profiles without notice and may result in termination of Membership privileges.
<br><br>
These Terms of Service apply to all Users. The Website may contain links to third party websites or provide content from third party websites that are not owned or controlled by KAOTIC.COM. KAOTIC.COM has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party websites. By using the Website, you expressly relieve KAOTIC.COM and its affiliates from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website.
