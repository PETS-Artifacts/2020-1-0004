              <li>
                <h5>Can I reply to my audience through Buffer?</h5>
                <p>Buffer manages your publishing and analytics. We do have a separate product, <a href="/reply">Reply</a>, which allows you to engage with your audience on Twitter &amp; Facebook.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Can I bulk upload my posts to Buffer?</h5>
                <p>Yes! Buffer intergrates with a tool called <a href="https://www.bulkbuffer.com">Bulk Buffer</a>, which allows you to bulk upload your posts and save even more time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>What payment methods does Buffer accept?</h5>
                <p>Buffer accepts all major credit cards and pre-paid cards. You can also pay through your iTunes account. Unfortunately we are not able to accept payments via PayPal nor are we able to issue invoices and receive checks as payment. We're really sorry for the limitations there. We'd love to explore more payment methods in the future!</p>

    <h1>Our Privacy Policy</h1>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="template-text-block">

  <p><em>Last Updated: December 18, 2017</em></p>

  <p>Buffer provides this Privacy Policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information received from users of this website, located at https://buffer.com ("Site"), as well as all related websites, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, together with the Site, our “Service”). This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Buffer Terms of Use.</p>

  <p>By using our Service you are consenting to our Processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing" means using cookies on a computer or using or accessing such information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities may take place in the United States.</p>

  <p>The Service is hosted in the United States. If you choose to use the Service  from the European Union or other regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to the US and Processed under U.S. privacy standards. Also, we may transfer your data from the U.S. to other countries or regions in connection with the Processing of data, fulfilling your requests, and operating the Service. By visiting our Service and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and Processing in, the US.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>Our primary goals in collecting information from you are to provide you with the products and services made available through the Service, to communicate with you, and to manage your registered user account, if you have one. We may also use your information to operate, maintain, and enhance the Service and its features, and to provide customer support to users.</p>

  <h2>Information Collected Upon Registration</h2>
  <p>You provide us with information when you register for an account, use the Service, make a purchase on the Service, or send us customer service-related requests. If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Buffer. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Service, or if you desire to receive marketing materials and information. Information that we may collect in such instances may include your IP address, full user name, password, email address, city, time zone, credit card and other billing information,  preferences, telephone number, and other information that you decide to provide us with. We may link such information with other information you provide about yourself.</p>

  <h3>Use of Google User Data</h3>
  <p>If you choose to connect a Google+ page or profile to your Buffer account, we will access certain information obtained from Google regarding your account. In particular we may store your name and email address as well as information on the particular page or profile you connect, including post content and engagement data. This data will only be used by Buffer to provide you with the service you expect and will not be shared with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Use of Contact Information</h2>
  <p>In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please un-follow us, or follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications. You may also opt out from receiving commercial email from us by sending your request to us by email at hello@buffer.com. Please be aware that if you opt out of receiving commercial email from us or otherwise modify the nature or frequency of promotional communications you receive from us, it may take up to ten business days for us to process your request, and you may continue receiving promotional communications from us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt out from receiving commercial messages from us, you will continue to receive administrative messages from us regarding the Service.</p>

  <h2>Log Data</h2>
  <p>When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Site and of our Service, and for the Site’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Service.</p>

  <h2>Cookies and Automatically Collected Information</h2>
  <p>Like many websites, we also use "cookie" technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer's hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Buffer may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our services. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential. Buffer does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.</p>
  <p>We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message. This information is gathered from all users, and may be connected with other information about you. </p>

  <h2>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</h2>
  <p>We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons (such as the Facebook “share” button) that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Buffer. Information collected by a third party in this manner is subject to that third party’s own data collection, use, and disclosure policies.</p>

  <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>Our primary purpose for using your information is to publish your content on social platforms.  In addition, we may share and disclose your information for the following reasons:
      <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
          <li><strong>Service Providers.</strong> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, billing, customer relationship, database storage and management, and direct marketing campaigns. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data.</li>
          <li><strong>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</strong> Buffer cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to investigate, respond to, and defend against claims, for legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Buffer or a third party, to protect Buffer against liability, for the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, fraudulent, abusive, or legally actionable activity,  to protect the security or integrity of the Service and any equipment used to make the Service available, or to comply with the law.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> Buffer may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy.</li>
          <li><strong>Other Third Parties.</strong> We may make certain aggregated, automatically-collected, or otherwise non-personal information available to third parties for various purposes, including for business or marketing purposes or to assist third parties in understanding our users’ interest, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through the Service.</li>
      </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Changing or Deleting Information</h2>
  <p>If you are a registered user of the Site, you may access, update, correct, or delete the information you provided to us by e-mailing us at hello@buffer.com. Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>Buffer is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. Please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee that information about you will not be accessed, viewed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our administrative, physical, and electronic safeguards. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on this Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

  <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
  <p>Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personally identifiable information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personally identifiable information you submit to them. We are not responsible for the content, privacy and security practices, and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit.</p>

  <h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>
  <p>The Site is not directed to persons under 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at hello@buffer.com. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal identifiable Information, we will delete such information from our files.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason; each version will apply to information collected while it was in place. We will notify you of any modifications to our Privacy Policy by posting the new Privacy Policy on our Site and indicating the date of the latest revision. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access the Service for the first time after such material changes are made. Your continued use of the Service after the revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
  <p>Residents of California have the right to request a disclosure describing what types of personal information we have shared with third parties for their direct marketing purposes, and with whom we have shared it, during the preceding year. You may request a copy of that disclosure by contacting us at hello@buffer.com.</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of December 18, 2017. If you have any thoughts or questions about this Privacy Policy please let us know.</p>
