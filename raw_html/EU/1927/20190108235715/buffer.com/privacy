              <li>
                <h5>Can I reply to my audience through Buffer?</h5>
                <p>Buffer manages your publishing and analytics. We do have a separate product, <a href="/reply">Reply</a>, which allows you to engage with your audience on Twitter &amp; Facebook.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>Can I bulk upload my posts to Buffer?</h5>
                <p>Yes! Buffer intergrates with a tool called <a href="https://www.bulkbuffer.com">Bulk Buffer</a>, which allows you to bulk upload your posts and save even more time.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>What payment methods does Buffer accept?</h5>
                <p>Buffer accepts all major credit cards and pre-paid cards. You can also pay through your iTunes account. Unfortunately we are not able to accept payments via PayPal nor are we able to issue invoices and receive checks as payment. We're really sorry for the limitations there. We'd love to explore more payment methods in the future!</p>

        <p><strong>Log Data</strong><br>
        When you use our Service, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click.</p>
        <p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong><br>
        Like many websites, we also use “cookie” technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Site and our Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. Buffer may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Site and our Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Site, and to improve the Site and our Service.</p>
        <p>We may also automatically record certain information from your device by using various types of technology, including “clear gifs” or “web beacons.” This automatically collected information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after you use the Service, the pages or other content you view or otherwise interact with on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. We also may use these technologies to collect information regarding your interaction with email messages, such as whether you opened, clicked on, or forwarded a message, to the extent permitted under applicable law.</p>
        <p>You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from the Service, you may not be able to utilize the features of the Service to their fullest potential.</p>
        <p><strong>Do Not Track</strong><br>
        Buffer does not process or respond to web browsers’ “do not track” signals or other similar transmissions that indicate a request to disable online tracking of users who use our Service.</p>
        <p><strong>Third Party Web Beacons and Third Party Buttons</strong><br>
        We may display third-party content on the Service, including third-party advertising. Third-party content may use cookies, web beacons, or other mechanisms for obtaining data in connection with your viewing of the third party content on the Service. Additionally, we may implement third party buttons, such as Facebook “share” buttons, that may function as web beacons even when you do not interact with the button. Information collected through third-party web beacons and buttons is collected directly by these third parties, not by Buffer. Please consult such third party’s data collection, use, and disclosure policies for more information.</p>
        <p><strong>Links to Other Websites</strong><br>
        Our Site contains links to other websites. The fact that we link to a website is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personal Information from you. Other sites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the Personal Information you submit to them. We are not responsible for the content, privacy and security practices, and policies of third-party sites or services to which links or access are provided through the Service.

        <p>We also take measures to delete your Personal Information or keep it in a form that does not permit identifying you when this information is no longer necessary for the purposes for which we process it, unless we are required by law to keep this information for a longer period.
