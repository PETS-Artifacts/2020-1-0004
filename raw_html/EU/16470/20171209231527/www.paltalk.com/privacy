Paltalk strives to provide the best possible user experience for all of its members, and this includes allowing users to express themselves in their own unique ways. Paltalk allows you to submit up to 10 pictures of yourself, including one primary picture and 9 secondary pictures. Non-paying members can only view primary pictures, and paying members can view all pictures. Paltalk will screen all primary pictures within 48 hours after submission, and you will be notified when it is approved or rejected. Primary pictures will not be displayed until Paltalk approves them. Pictures may not be blank or of poor quality, may not be copyrighted, may not contain the image of a celebrity, may not be harassing, may not contain excessive violence, may not be profane or use offensive language, may not be obscene or indecent and may not be greater than 100K in file size.</p><p><strong>PRIMARY PICTURES.</strong> Primary pictures must additionally follow these guidelines:</p><p>Picture must be of the submitter, must only display the submitter, and must clearly display their face. Picture cannot contain text or contact information. Occasionally, with your permission, Paltalk will feature your pictures in various places throughout Paltalk, such as Paltalk Today, the Paltalk homepage, or other locations. If you wish to have your primary picture considered for display in these areas or others simply access the privacy section of your Paltalk People profile and modify the appropriate setting.</p><p><strong>NO SOLICITATION; NO DENIGRATION.</strong> As a condition to your use of Paltalk, you agree that you will not either directly or indirectly (a) solicit, cause, or assist in soliciting or causing, any employee, officer, director, agent, administrator, palhelp, consultant or any other person that is employed by, consults for, volunteers for, represents or assists Paltalk (each a "Representative") to (i) terminate, suspend, discontinue or end such Representative's employment, consultancy and/or other relationship with Paltalk, or (ii) become employed by, or work or consult for any other entity or person, (b) make any negative, denigrating or defamatory statement(s) or comment(s) about Paltalk or any Representative, or otherwise engage in any conduct or action that might tarnish the image, reputation, ability or character of Paltalk or any Representative, or otherwise tarnish or dilute any of Paltalk's trade or service marks and/or its goodwill; or (c) solicit or cause any existing customer or client of Paltalk to cease using, and/or any potential customer or client of Paltalk not to use any Paltalk products and/or services and/or to use any software and/or other product(s) and/or services that are competitive with Paltalk's products and/or services; (d) aid, abet or authorize any person or entity to engage in any of the foregoing.</p><p><strong>ROOM RATINGS.</strong> Group Chat Rooms are "rated" in order to enable users to determine what language and images are appropriate and may be expected. The ratings are guidelines that are enforced by the administrators of each chat room, and are not to be regarded as an assurance that the content will be safe or acceptable to you or anyone under eighteen (18) years of age. For example, in a "G-Rated Room," no foul language is permitted, nor are pictures involving adult themes (nudity or violence, for example). In an "R-Rated Room," some offensive language and content may occur; accordingly, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old to participate. In an "A-Rated Room," you should expect offensive language and content and you must be at least eighteen (18) years old to participate in such a room. Paltalk is not liable for any assumptions that you make when entering any given chat room or for any inappropriately rated chat rooms and you assume all risk in joining any chat room or permitting anyone under eighteen (18) years old to join any chat room.</p><p><strong>HOSTING A CHAT ROOM.</strong> In accordance with the Terms of Service, you have the ability to create your own room on Paltalk. If you are the host of a room and another user is not behaving in a manner that is consistent with the Terms of Service as applicable to your room, you (and certain people authorized by you), have various options to address such behavior. By "RIGHT CLICKING" on the name of the person that is not behaving appropriately, you will see a menu of choices, including: (a) removing that person's ability to speak ("Remove Mic"), (b) removing that person from your room ("Bounce"), and (c) alerting Paltalk personnel ("Alert Admin of Misconduct"). In addition, you can add the user to your PalList, RIGHT CLICK on the user's name and click on "Block User," which will prevent the user from contacting you (except if you are in a group with that User). When creating your own room, more information will be available to you.</p><h5>USER SUBMISSIONS.</h5><ol><li>As a Paltalk account holder you may submit video content ("User Submissions"). You understand that whether or not such User Submissions are published, Paltalk does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to any User Submissions.</li><li>You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them.

We want you to feel free to express yourself within the Paltalk community, and are committed to ensuring that you are in control of what you share with the rest of the community, and with Paltalk.</p><h4>Information Collection &amp; Use</h4><h5>Registration</h5><p>In order to use Paltalk, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give contact information such as your email address. We use this information to contact you about services on our site in which you have expressed interest. Please see below for Information and Sharing Disclosure.</p><h5>Communications from the Site</h5><ul><li><h6>Special Offers and Updates</h6><p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, or promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out."</p></li><li><h6>Newsletters</h6><p>If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice and Opt-out" section.</p></li><li><h6>Service-related Announcements</h6><p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account.</p></li><li><h6>Customer Service</h6><p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p></li><li><h6>Profile</h6><p>We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, to create a "profile" of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. We do not share your profile with other third parties without your consent.</p><p>Paltalk is the sole owner of the information collected on Paltalk.com. Paltalk collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site or through our downloaded software.</p></li><li><h6>Orders</h6><p>If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).</p><p>We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. We will use this information to contact you and confirm your orders.</p></li></ul><h5>Uses of Information</h5><p>Paltalk's primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with a customized experience on Paltalk and through our partners. This includes personalization services, interactive communications, and many other types of services, most of which are completely free to you. In order to provide services free of charge, we display advertisements and encourage your participation. By knowing a little about you, Paltalk is able to deliver more relevant advertisements and content, and hence better service, to you.</p><p>In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, Paltalk plays the middleman. Advertisers give us advertisements and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, males over 35 years old). Paltalk displays the advertisement to users meeting the specified criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual user information. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with banner ads as well as promotional email through Paltalk and its affiliates. You will only receive special offers via email from Paltalk if you have indicated in your account preferences, or at some other time, that you would like to receive them.</p><h5>Personally identifiable information:</h5><ul><li><h6>Agents</h6><p>We use outside credit card processing companies to bill you for Paltalk services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p><p>We use outside email delivery systems to contact you and provide you with pertinent information via email. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.</p></li><li><h6>Advertising</h6><p>We use third-party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on our behalf when you visit our Web site.  These companies may use information (not including personal information such as your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.</p></li><li><h6>Legal Disclaimer</h6><p>We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.</p></li><li><h6>Choice/Opt-out</h6><p>We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.</p></li></ul><p>If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or visiting <a href="http://register.paltalk.com/reg/ControllerServlet?RequestId=Register.ShowOptout&amp;src=paltalk"> http://register.paltalk.com/reg/ControllerServlet?RequestId=Register.ShowOptout&amp;src=paltalk </a>. You may also contact us at:</p><p>Paltalk.com<br />PO Box 7528<br />New York, N.Y. 10116</p><p>Or, please contact our helpful customer support staff online.

This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.</p><p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to administer the site and to track users' movements around the site.</p><p>We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information except during special promotions such as free trials when subscription IP addresses are temporarily tied to personally identifiable information.</p></li><li><h6>Cookies</h6><p>A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use session ID cookies on this site to maintain your subscription and maintain your account.

A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.</p></li><li><h6>Clear Gifs</h6><p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.</p><p>We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice and Opt-out."</p></li><li><h6>Third Party Advertisers</h6><p>The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to users by a Paltalk proprietary ad serving system.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.</p></li><li><h6>Access to Personally Identifiable Information</h6><p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by making the change on http://my.paltalk.com or by contacting our helpful customer support staff online by clicking Groups on the Paltalk buddy list window, then Paltalk Help.</p></li><li><h6>Security</h6><p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information such as credit card numbers on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p><p>We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.

You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</p></li><li><h6>Changes in this Privacy Statement</h6><p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p><p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p><p>This statement reflects the privacy policy of Paltalk with respect to the Web site located at www.Paltalk.com (the "Site").
