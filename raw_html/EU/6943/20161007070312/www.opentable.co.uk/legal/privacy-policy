			When you make a Restaurant reservation through our Sites, your information is provided to us and certain information is provided to the restaurants with whom you choose to reserve. In order to facilitate your reservation, certain information is provided to that restaurant, just as it would if you made a reservation by calling the restaurant, emailing the restaurant or using the restaurant&rsquo;s website.

You also have the option of indicating special preferences or providing comments about your reservation that OpenTable will pass on to that restaurant.</p>
		<p style="text-align: justify;">
			We may share with restaurants summary reports of feedback from diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant through our Sites, these comments may be shared with that restaurant. We will not tie your comments with other information that can identify you, but a restaurant may be able to tell who you are from your comments, particularly if you give your name in the comments or provide contact information such as an email address.</p>
