<br/><br/>
<h2>Privacy Policy.</h2><br/>
<p>Because Company gathers certain types of information about the User, User should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information Company gathers and how Company is using it.</p>
<p>Company gathers two types of information about Users:</p>
<ul>
<li>a)	Information that Users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive Company’s electronic newsletters, to participate in message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys;</li>
<li>b)	Information Company gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout Company’s websites. This information allows Company to better tailor its content to User’s needs and to help Company’s advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of the audience. Under no circumstances does Company divulge any information about an individual User to a third party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users of the website's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.</p>
<p>Company may offer interactive polls to Users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. Company may use a system to "tag" Users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual Users.</p>
<p>Company may occasionally conduct User surveys to better target Company’s content to the audience. Company sometimes shares the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with Company’s sponsors, advertisers and partners. Company never shares any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</p>
<p>Company tracks User traffic patterns throughout all of its websites. However, Company does not correlate this information with data about individual Users. Company does break down overall usage statistics according to a User's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every User's browser).</p>
<p>Company sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that Users enter in Company’s search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual Users. Company uses tracking information to determine which areas of its sites Users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Company does not track what individual Users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps Company to continue to build a better service for the User.</p>
