        <p><strong><u>When we’re required to enter into a contract with you</u></strong></p>
        <ul class="padding-left-plus-15px">

        <p>We use email and text messages to communicate with you about our products and services, competitions, offers, promotions or special events where you tick a box.</p>
        <p>For example</p>

        <p>As a Company we are often required to process your personal data in order to carry out certain tasks relating to our business activities. In such cases, processing of personal data can be justified on grounds of legitimate interest.</p>
        <p><strong>Communications</strong></p>
        <ul class="padding-left-plus-15px">
            <li>To provide customer support and to respond to, and communicate with you about your requests</li>
            <li>To contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information</li>

            <li>To comply with a request from you in connection with the exercise of your rights (for example where you have asked us not to contact you for marketing purposes, we will keep a record of this on our suppression lists in order to be able to comply with your request)</li>
            <li>To send communications to you about your orders, purchases or accounts and bill you for using our products or services </li>
            <li>To let you post on our blogs and interact with us through social media.</li>

        <p><strong>Personalise &amp; Improve our Service</strong></p>
        <ul class="padding-left-plus-15px">
            <li>To personalise your experience on our online services. This could include providing you with interesting, relevant content, or making navigation to our Sites and Mobile Apps easier</li>
            <li>To help us understand more about you as a customer, the products and services you use, the way you use them and how you shop across the company, so we can serve you better </li>
            <li>Improve the content and appearance of the Website(s) or App(s), and to make sure that content is presented in the most effective manner for you</li>

        </ul>
        <p><strong>Company Interest</strong></p>
        <ul class="padding-left-plus-15px">
            <li>Where you fail to repay what you owe Us or return our property, we may need to trace your whereabouts (sometimes using a tracing Agent) in order to recover payment or reclaim property. This might be carried out by a third Party debt recovery agent on our behalf</li>

        <p>In certain circumstances it is in your vital interests for us to process your personal information.

        <h4>International transfers of your personal information</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>From time to time we may transfer your personal information to our suppliers, service providers and other company offices based outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

        <p>If we do transfer information to our agents or advisers outside of the EEA, we will make sure that it is protected in the same way as if it was being used in the EEA. We’ll use one of these safeguards:</p>

        <h4>How we use your information to make automated decisions</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>We sometimes use systems to make automated decisions based on your personal information or the information we are allowed to collect from others about you or your business (for example where we perform credit checks). This helps us to make sure our decisions are quick, fair, efficient and correct, based on what we know. These automated decisions can affect the products, services or features we may offer you now or in the future, or the price that we charge you for them.</p>
        <p><strong>Your rights</strong><br>You have rights over automated decisions.</p>
        <ul class="padding-left-plus-15px">

			<div class="modal-body">
				<p>4G is the next step up from 3G, giving you mobile internet speeds up to five times faster than before. In fact, even the
					average home broadband speed can't match 4G. That means you can stream movies in HD without buffering, play online games
					in real time and upload photos to Facebook instantly.</p>
				<p>The 4G network we use already covers huge parts of the country and by the end of the year we're aiming to cover 98% of
					the population, so you'll be able to experience faster internet almost anywhere.</p>
				<p>If you do find yourself somewhere that we haven't brought 4G to yet, don't worry, you'll still have access to our
					Advanced 3G service, the fastest 3G connection in the UK.</p>

						<h4>Pocket the difference with a refurbished deal.</h4>
						<p>We all know the main benefit of choosing a refurbished smartphone is to save some cash. You can expect cheaper
							monthly line rental, or less to pay up front, and get the latest tech in your pocket without the usual
							price-tag.</p>
						<p>You might be wary of ordering a refurbished phone, but there's no need to worry. Our stock is provided directly
							from mobile manufacturers, who have expertly inspected the goods to ensure they're in top working order. This
							gives you peace of mind, as well as great savings.</p>
						<p>As well as being kind on your wallet, ordering a refurbished phone is also great news for the environment. With
							components being re-used, this means less of an environmental footprint than a newly-manufactured phone.</p>
					</div>

					</div>
					<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 text-left description">
						<h4>Does refurbished mean these phones were faulty?</h4>
						<p>Most refurbished stock is due to change-of-mind returns, where a customer has sent the phone back during their
							cooling off period. Returned items cannot be sold as new, so we offer these as refurbs. Occasionally of course,
							handsets may be returned to us due to a slight manufacturer's fault. In these cases the phones will be repaired
							in-house by our approved technicians, then inspected by fully qualified engineers who carry out extensive checks
							and tests until all faults are fixed.</p>
						<p>If a handset is returned due to a fault, it will only be sold as a refurbished once the engineers are satisfied
							that any issues have been fully repaired. We have the highest grading process on the market, as we ensure that
							all refurbished stock is Grade-A rated. This means that the item is "good as new", and we don't offer handsets
							for sale that are rated any lower. This gives you peace of mind that your refurbished smartphone will reach you
							in immaculate working condition.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row max brand-light-grey-bg modal-section middle-25">
					<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 text-left description">
						<h4>Are refurbished phones still covered by warranty?</h4>
						<p>Yes, they're subject to the same warranty as brand new handsets. As with our new handsets, all refurbished phones
							are covered by a 12 month warranty. In fact, if your phone should develop a manufacturer's fault within the
							first month of ownership, we'll send a courier to your home to pick up the phone, and get this exchanged in our
							warehouse right away, so you don't have to wait ages without a working phone.</p>
						<p>Outside of the first month, you're covered by free repairs at your local Carphone Warehouse store, should the
							phone develop a fault during the first year. As well as the one-year retailer's warranty provided by us, most
							handsets are also covered by a manufacturer's warranty too. This differs depending on the manufacturer, so you
							may wish to check this at the point of sale. The warranty offered by us doesn't affect the manufacturer's, with
							most mobile brands offering 12 or 24 months alongside our own. So even if your refurbished phone develops a
							fault somewhere down the line, you get the same level of cover as you do with a brand new device.</p>

					<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 text-left description">
						<h4>Do I still get everything that comes in the box?</h4>
						<p>Due to the nature of refurbished mobile phones, the original accessories can't be guaranteed. As the item may
							have been handled already, we don't include accessories such as earphones for hygiene reasons. However, it's
							worth remembering that the amount of cash you're saving on a refurbished phone is a lot more than the value of a
							pair of headphones, so even if you pick up an accessory or two separately, you'll still be in pocket in the long
							run.</p>
						<p>The handset may also come in plain white packaging (although sometimes it'll be delivered in the original box,
							depending on its condition). In all cases, you can be guaranteed to receive a charger, so you won't lose any
							time in getting your handset juiced up and ready to go.</p>

				</div>
				<div class="row max brand-light-grey-bg modal-section middle-25">
					<div class="col-md-8 col-sm-12 text-left description">
						<h4>Do you offer refurbished iPhones?</h4>
						<p>Yes we do. Ordering a refurbished iPhone is a great way to grab yourself the latest iPhone tech on a budget. Just
							be aware that refurbished iPhones tend to be locked to the network you've ordered, so you wouldn't be able to
							use it with a different SIM if that was your plan. Other than that, you get the same great phone and warranty as
							you would with a new iPhone, so take a look at the full range offered.</p>
						<p>As one of the market leaders in smartphone technology, iPhones have never been the cheapest option. However, with
							a refurbished iPhone deal you can get the latest models without the usual price-tag. With a refurbished iPhone
							6s, you'll enjoy Apple's most advanced iPhone to date, while a refurbished iPhone SE offers similar features in
							a smaller, cheaper design. Even less recent handsets, such as a refurbished iPhone 5s, would still deliver
							awesome specs at a price to suit.</p>
						<p>Why not browse our range of refurbished iPhone deals?</p>

								<h5>Refurbished</h5>
								<p>When sat side-by-side, there's not much that would separate a cheap refurbished phone from a new phone.
									Other than a cheaper price-tag and a non-branded box, you still get a fully working handset, full
									warranty, the excitement of receiving a great bit of tech, and complete peace of mind.</p>

									regular prices, so you don't get the extra savings. You're covered by a warranty to protect against
									manufacturer faults, which is included when you buy refurbished phones too.</p>
