<p><a name="howwecollectanduseinformation"></a><strong>1. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>We collect the following types of information about you:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Information you provide us directly:</strong> We ask for certain information such as your username, first and last name, address and e-mail address when you register for a PucaTrade account, or if you correspond with us. We may also retain any messages you send through the Service, and may collect information you provide in User Content you post to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Information we may receive from third parties</strong>: We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, if you access our websites or Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, by &ldquo;following,&rdquo; &ldquo;liking,&rdquo; adding the PucaTrade application, linking your account to the PucaTrade Service, etc., that third party may pass certain information about your use of its service to PucaTrade. This information could include, but is not limited to, the user ID associated with your account (for example, your Facebook UID), an access token necessary to access that service, any information that you have permitted the third party to share with us, and any information you have made public in connection with that service. If you allow us access to your friends list, your friends&rsquo; user IDs, and your connection to those friends, may be used and stored to make your experience more social, and to allow you to invite your friends to use our Service as well as provide you with updates if and when your friends join PucaTrade. You should always review, and if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the PucaTrade Service. You may also unlink your third party account from the Service by adjusting your settings on the third party service. If you unlink your third party account, we will remove the information collected about you in connection with that service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Inviting a friend to use PucaTrade from the &ldquo;Invite friends&rdquo; feature:</strong> If you choose to use our invitation service to invite a third party to the Service through our &ldquo;Invite friends&rdquo; feature, you may directly choose a friend to invite through your mobile device&rsquo;s native contact list &ndash; but we do not require that you import your contacts list to the Service, and we do not retain the information contained in your contacts list. You understand that by inviting a friend to PucaTrade through the &ldquo;Invite friends&rdquo; feature, you are directly sending a text or email from your personal accounts and that we are not storing your contact list. In addition, you understand and agree that normal carrier charges apply to communications sent from you phone. Since this invitation is coming directly from your email or phone, we do not have access to or control this communication.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Finding your friends on the Service: </strong>If you choose, you can locate your friends with PucaTrade accounts through our &ldquo;Find friends&rdquo; feature. The &ldquo;Find friends&rdquo; feature allows you to choose to locate friends either through (i) your contact list, (ii) social media sites (such as Twitter or Facebook) or (iii) through a search of names and usernames on PucaTrade. If you choose to find your friends through your contact list, then you agree to provide PucaTrade access to your contact list such that we can perform the search necessary to determine whether or not someone associated with the information you provide is using PucaTrade. If you choose to find your friends through social media sites, then you understand that the information these sites provide to use to conduct this type of search is governed by their privacy policies and your account settings on those sites. If you choose to find your friends through a search of names or usernames then simply type a name to search and see if that name or username appears on our Service. Note that we do not retain any information contained in your contacts list, or information from social media sites about your contacts, and we do not use such information for any purpose other than to help you find your friends on PucaTrade.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Analytics information</strong>: We may directly collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit and other information that assists us in improving the Service. We collect and use this analytics information in aggregate form such that it cannot reasonably be manipulated to identify any particular individual user.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Cookies information</strong>: When you visit the Service, we may send one or more cookies &mdash; a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters &mdash; to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets PucaTrade help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site.

A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser&rsquo;s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Log file information</strong>: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Clear gifs/web beacons information</strong>: When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information is allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Commercial and marketing communications: </strong>We use the information we collect or receive to communicate directly with you. We may send you emails containing newsletters, promotions and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you will be given the option to opt out or change your preferences. We also use your information to send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. You will also be able to be &ldquo;found&rdquo; on PucaTrade based on information that you provide (see &ldquo;Find friends on PucaTrade&rdquo;) above.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Use of certain service type information we collect about you: </strong>We use or may use cookies, log file, device identifiers, location data and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and demographic patterns; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in; and (g) automatically update the PucaTrade application on your mobile devices.</p>
