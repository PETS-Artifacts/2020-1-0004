When Firefox Cloud Services (the &quot;Services&quot;) sends information to Mozilla (that's us) our <a href=https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/ >Mozilla Privacy Policy</a> describes how we use that information.</p> <h2>Things you should know:</h2> <p>You send us different types of data depending on what features of the Services you use.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Email address</strong>: When you sign up for a Firefox Account, we receive your email address and a hash of your password. In addition, you may optionally add a profile image or use Gravatar (in which case, we'll share your email address with Gravatar to obtain your profile image).</li> <li><strong>Sync</strong>: If you enable Sync, we receive, in encrypted format, the data that you sync across devices (which may include Firefox tabs, add-ons, passwords, bookmarks, history, and preferences). While this cannot be decrypted by us, you should use a strong password to prevent unauthorized access to your synced data. We also store information about your device operating system and Firefox version to show you which devices are synced to your account.</li> <li><strong>Location data</strong>: For security purposes, we store the IP addresses from which you access your Firefox Account to approximate your city and country. We use this data to send you email alerts if we detect suspicious activity, such as account logins from other locations. <ul> <li><strong>Find My Device</strong>: If you enable Find My Device, we receive the approximate location of your device only when you sign into your Firefox Account and specifically request us to locate a connected device. While signed in, you can see your device’s last known locations on a map. We regularly delete these locations and will not collect further locations until you request us to.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <hr> <p>We use cookies, clear GIFs and other web technologies to offer and improve our products and services.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Online Data Tools</strong>: We use “online data tools” such as cookies, clear GIFs and web beacons to provide the functionality of our products and services. For example, cookies assist with user sign-in and authentication. We also use these same tools to collect data to improve our products and services. For example, we use cookies to provide web analytics.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Options</strong>: You can learn more about what cookies are and manage cookies in Firefox by clicking <a href=https://support.mozilla.org/kb/cookies-information-websites-store-on-your-computer>here</a>. Note that certain features of our and other products and services may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p></li> </ul> </article> </section> </div> </div> <a id=about-mozilla rel=author target=_blank href="https://www.mozilla.org/about/?utm_source=firefox-accounts&amp;utm_medium=Referral"></a> <!--[if lt IE 10]>
