		<h2 id="terms" class="block-title terms-title">Acceptance of the Terms of Service</h2>
		<p>The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these &ldquo;<strong>Terms of Service</strong>&rdquo;), govern your access (&ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<strong>your</strong>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<strong>Subscriber</strong>&rdquo;) to and use of www.pornhubpremium.com ( &ldquo;<strong>Pornhub Premium</strong>&rdquo; or the &ldquo;<strong>Website</strong>&rdquo;), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Website, whether as a guest or a registered user. These Terms of Service apply to the Website, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network &ldquo;tabs&rdquo;, or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed <em>via</em> computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.</p>
		<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="/terms#policy">http://www.pornhubpremium.com/terms/#policy</a>, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.</p>
		<p>If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service. If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.</p>
		<p>You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form.</p>
		<p>When using the Website, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies. Such rules, guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. We may also offer other websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.</p>

		<p>Ability to Accept Terms of Service</p>
		<p>You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Website. You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.</p>

		<p>Changes to the Terms of Service</p>
		<p>We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at <a href="/terms">http://www.pornhubpremium.com/terms/#terms</a>, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>
		<p>If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the &ldquo;last modified date&rdquo;. You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms. If the &ldquo;last modified date&rdquo; is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.</p>
		<p>All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the Website subsequent to us making available an amended version of these Terms of Service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.</p>

		<p><strong>Communication Preferences</strong></p>
		<p>	By using the Website, you expressly and specifically consent to receiving electronic communications from us relating to your account. These communications may involve sending emails to your email address provided during registration, or posting communications on the Website (for example, through the members’ area on the Website upon login to ensure receipt in the event you have unsubscribed from email communications), or in the &ldquo;Your Account&rdquo; page and may include notices about your account (such as upcoming payment notifications, change in password or payment method, confirmation e-mails and other transactional information) and are part of your relationship with us. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing. You should maintain copies of electronic communications by printing a paper copy or saving an electronic copy. You also expressly and specifically consent to receiving certain other communications from us, such as newsletters about new Website features and content, special offers, promotional announcements and customer surveys via email or other methods. If you no longer want to receive certain non-transactional communications, you will need to avail yourself of the unsubscribe mechanism set out in the applicable communication.</p>
		<p>Some communications to you may be presented via email campaigns or other means of communications with the option to express your preference by either clicking or entering &ldquo;accept&rdquo; (alternatively &ldquo;yes&rdquo;) or &ldquo;decline&rdquo; (alternatively &ldquo;no&rdquo;). By selecting or clicking the &ldquo;accept&rdquo; or &ldquo;yes&rdquo; options, you indicate that you &ldquo;OPT-IN&rdquo; to that offer and thereby agree and assent that your personal information, including your email address and data may be used for that matter or disclosed to third-parties. On the other hand, some communications to you may be presented via email campaigns or other means of communications with a pre-selected preference or choice. If you do not deselect the pre-selected preference of choice (i.e., &ldquo;OPT-OUT&rdquo; of the offer) then we may transfer your personal profile information to the third-party service or content provider making the offer. If you deselect the pre-selected preference then no personal information about you may be disclosed to any third-party service or content provider.</p>

		<p><b>Subscriptions, Free Trials, Promotion Subscriptions, Billing and Cancellation</b></p>
		<p>Subscriptions</p>
		<p>Your subscription to our services, which may start with a free trial or promotional subscription, will continue unless and until you cancel or we terminate it. You must provide us with a current, valid, accepted method of payment (as such may be updated from time to time, &ldquo;<b>Payment Method</b>&rdquo;) to use our services. We will bill the applicable subscription fee to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of the next period’s subscription fees to your Payment Method.</p>
		<p>We may offer a number of subscription plans, including special promotional plans or subscriptions with differing conditions and limitations. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Service will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You can find specific details regarding your subscription with us by verifying the email receipt issued upon your sign-up or by contacting us in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a>. Some promotional subscriptions may be offered by third parties in conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products and services provided by such third parties. We reserve the right to modify, terminate or otherwise amend our offered subscription plans.</p>
		<p>Free Trials and Promotional Subscriptions</p>
		<p>Your subscription to our services may start with a free trial or promotional subscription. The free trial period of your subscription lasts for seven days, or as otherwise specified during sign-up. For combinations with other offers, restrictions may apply. Free trials or promotional subscriptions are for new and certain former subscribers only. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to determine your eligibility for free trial or promotional subscription.</p>
		<p>We will begin billing your Payment Method for monthly subscription fees at the end of the free trial period of your subscription or at the end of your promotional subscription unless you cancel prior to the end of the applicable period. To view the specific details of your subscription, including monthly subscription price and end date of your free trial period or promotional subscription, please verify the email receipt issued upon your sign-up or contact us in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a>. We may authorize your Payment Method through various methods, including authorizing it up to an amount equal to or similar to the amount of the monthly subscription fee as soon as you register. In some instances, your available balance or credit limit may be reduced to reflect the authorization during your free trial period. However, you will not be charged during your free trial period for the subscription fee.</p>
		<p>You will not receive a notice from us that your free trial period has ended or that the paying portion of your subscription has begun. We will continue to bill your Payment Method on a monthly basis for your subscription fee until you cancel.</p>
		<p>Billing</p>
		<p>By starting your subscription and providing or designating a Payment Method, you authorize us to charge you a recurring subscription fee at the then current rate, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of our Service to your Payment Method. You acknowledge that the amount billed each period may vary (but not materially) from term to term and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts, which may be billed monthly in one or more charges.</p>		
		<p>We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our service or any components thereof in any manner and at any time as we may determine in our sole and absolute discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Service, any material price increases to your service will take effect following notice to you.</p>
		<p>The subscription fee for our service will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your subscription and each period thereafter unless and until you cancel your subscription. We automatically bill your Payment Method each period on or near the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying subscription. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, as indicated below, if your Payment Method has not successfully been processed. In the event that your paying subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may bill your Payment Method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. Your renewal date may change due to changes in your subscription. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of subscription or service-related charges. In the event that your Payment Method does not successfully process a charge for a subscription fee, you authorize us to charge you an administration fee up to $1.99 in order to keep your subscription temporarily active until the full subscription fee can be processed successfully and your full term renewed.</p>
		<p>As used in these Terms of Service, “billing” shall indicate a charge, debit or other payment clearance, as applicable, against your Payment Method. Unless otherwise stated differently, month or monthly refers to your billing cycle.</p>
		<p>MG Billing, Probiller.com, MGBill, Vendo, Segpay, WTS, EPOCH, or others (depending on your geographical location) may appear on your credit card, bank statement, or phone bill for all applicable charges. If multiple websites are joined utilizing any Payment Method, your statement will list each individual purchase comprising the transaction. MG Billing may include other information on your statement based on requirements of credit card association, telephone regulation, National Automated Clearinghouse Association or any other mandated rules and regulations. If you elect to use a checking account to purchase a subscription to the Website, a debit will be executed on your checking account.</p>
		<p>No Refunds</p>
		<p>PAYMENTS ARE NONREFUNDABLE AND THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED PERIODS. In the event we terminate your rights to use the Website because of a breach of these Terms of Service, you shall not be entitled to the refund of any unused portion of subscription fees. Following any cancellation by you, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. Note however, that using the online form to cancel your subscription, as opposed to contacting our Customer Care in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a>, may result in an immediate loss of access to the Website. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our subscribers (“credits”). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
		<p>Cardholder Disputes/Chargebacks</p>
		<p>All chargebacks are thoroughly investigated and may prevent future purchases with MG Billing given the circumstances. Fraud claims may result in MG Billing contacting your issuer to protect you and prevent future fraudulent charges to your Payment Method.</p>
		<p>Payment Methods</p>
		<p>You may edit your Payment Method information by visiting the Website and clicking on the &ldquo;Your Account&rdquo; link, available at the top of the pages of the Website or by contacting our Customer Care in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com/">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a>. If a payment is not successfully processed, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not edit your Payment Method information or cancel your account, you remain responsible for any uncollected amounts and authorize us to continue billing the Payment Method, as it may be updated. This may result in a change to your payment billing dates. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a transaction fee or other charges.</p>
		<p>Electronic Receipt</p>
		<p>You will receive an email receipt to the email provided upon initial subscription. You may request a copy of the account of charges of your subscription to the Website but we cannot guarantee the availability of such records more than 365 days after the subscription date. Requests must be made directly to MG Billing. To contact MG Billing, refer to our Customer Care in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com/">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a>.</p>
		<p>Cancellation</p>
		<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying us other by electronic or conventional mail, by chat, or by telephone. You are liable for charges incurred until the date of the termination and you will continue to have access to our service through the end of your monthly billing period. WE DO NOT PROVIDE REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR ANY PARTIAL-MONTH SUBSCRIPTION PERIODS. To cancel your subscription, contact our Customer Care in one of the manners described at <a href="http://support.pornhubpremium.com/">http://support.pornhubpremium.com</a> and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your subscription, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.

		<h2>Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>
		<p>We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the &ldquo;<strong>DMCA</strong>&rdquo;)&nbsp;or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity, terminating the user&rsquo;s access to <a href="http://www.pornhubpremium.com">www.pornhubpremium.com</a> (&ldquo;<strong>Pornhub Premium</strong>&rdquo;), or all of the foregoing.</p>
		<p>If you believe any material accessible on Pornhub Premium infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, &ldquo;Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement&rdquo; for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner&rsquo;s behalf.</p>
		<p>If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, &ldquo;Counter-Notification Procedures&rdquo; for instructions on filing a counter notification). It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>
		<p>All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English. Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may, at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.</p>

		<h2>Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement</h2>
		<p>If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. <strong style="color:red;">Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.</strong></p>
		<p>You may notify Pornhub Premium of alleged copyright infringement <em>via</em> our form found at  <a href="http://www.pornhub.com/information#dmcaform">http://www.pornhub.com/information#dmcaform</a>. This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.</p>
		<p>We also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications. In that case, in accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the &ldquo;DMCA Notice&rdquo;)&nbsp;must include substantially the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.</li>
		<li>Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material. If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, is typically not adequate. Please include the URL(s)&nbsp;of the exact video(s).</li>
		<li>Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s)&nbsp;of any video(s)&nbsp;you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).</li>
		<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.</li>
		<li>A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
		<li>Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.</li>
		</ul>		
		<p>Our designated copyright agent to receive DMCA Notices is:</p>

Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices (as defined below) is expressly disclaimed</em>.</p>
		<p>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3)&nbsp;of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.</p>
		<p>Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Pornhub Premium is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees)&nbsp;under Section 512(f)&nbsp;of the DMCA.</p>
		<p>The copyright owner&rsquo;s name will be published on Pornhub Premium in place of disabled content. This will become part of the public record of your DMCA Notice, along with your description of the work(s)&nbsp;allegedly infringed. All the information provided in a DMCA Notice, the actual DMCA Notice (including your personal information), or both may be forwarded to the uploader of the allegedly infringing content. By submitting a DMCA Notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.</p>

		<h2>Counter-Notification Procedures</h2>
		<p>If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on Pornhub Premium was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a &ldquo;Counter-Notice&rdquo;). Counter notifications must be submitted by the video&rsquo;s original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.</p>
		<p>Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:</p>
		<ul>
		<li class="noListStyle">Lawrence G. Walters</li>
		<li><strong>Walters Law Group</strong></li>
		<li>195 W. Pine Ave.</li>
		<li>Longwood, FL 32750</li>
		<li>Email: copyright@pornhub.com</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p><em>Please do not send other inquiries or requests to our designated copyright agent. Absent prior express permission, our designated copyright agent is not authorized to accept or waive service of formal legal process, and any agency relationship beyond that required to receive valid DMCA Notices or Counter-Notices is expressly disclaimed</em>.</p>
		<p>Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;</li>
		<li>Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;</li>
		<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and</li>
		<li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of Pornhub Premium may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will not respond to Counter-Notices that do not meet the requirements set out above.</p>
		<p>After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.</p>
		<p>Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information. By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.</p>
		<p>Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Pornhub Premium was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys&rsquo; fees)&nbsp;under Section 512(f)&nbsp;of the DMCA.</p>

		<h2>Repeat Infringers</h2>
		<p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating or disabling, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access to Pornhub Premium, terminate or disable the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

		<h2>Video Fingerprinting</h2>
		<p>We use MediaWise&reg;, an automated audiovisual identification system, to assist us in identifying and blocking potentially infringing content from being uploaded by users. Videos uploaded to Pornhub Premium are compared against a database of digital fingerprints. When a video is matched to a digital fingerprint, access to it is disabled.</p>
		<p>If you are interested in having your content digitally fingerprinted by the provider of the automated audiovisual identification system we use, please contact Vobile in one of the manners described at <a href="http://www.vobileinc.com/contact/">http://www.vobileinc.com/contact/</a>.</p>
