<br><hr><br>
<h3 id="4">4. WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW DO WE USE IT?</h3>
<p>We obtain your personal information from the following sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Directly from you, either in person (at our cinemas or otherwise), via our Sites, on our social media pages or when you contact us or someone contacts us on your behalf;</li>
<li>Automated technologies, such as CCTV or other recording systems, cookies, server logs and other similar technologies;</li>
<li>From our group companies and third party service providers in the course of providing their services to us in connection with your use of our Sites and Services. Please see section 7 <a href="#7"><i>Who do we share your personal information with?</i></a> to find out more about these group companies and third party service providers;</li>
<li>Providers of social media platforms (such as FaceBook, Twitter and Instagram)  where you share our content through social media, by liking us on Facebook, following or tweeting about us on Twitter; and</li>
<li>Otherwise as explained below in this What Personal Information do we collect and how do we use it? section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information about you is to: (i) verify your identity and age; (ii) provide our Services to you and carry out requests made by you on the Sites or in our cinemas; (iii) help us improve our products and services and develop and market new products and services; (iv) investigate or settle inquiries or disputes; (v) comply with any applicable law, court order, other judicial process, or the requirements of a regulator; (vi) enforce our agreements with you; (vii) protect the rights, property or safety of us or third parties, including our other customers and users of the Sites and at our cinemas; (viii) provide support for the provision of our Services; and (ix) use as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
<p>In particular, we use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3 id="4.1">4.1 Fulfilment of products and services</h3>
<p>We collect and maintain personal information that is voluntarily submitted to us during the use of the Sites and/or our Services. We use the contact and payment details which are provided to us so that we can fulfil the supply of products and services which have been ordered from our Sites or in our cinemas. We will use contact information to send you service related communications relating to these orders. This includes your purchase of products and services, your registration for an account with us, your attendance at events hosted by us or our third party partners, your hire of our cinemas for your own events and the processing of returns and refunds. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ticket bookings, gifts and other online purchases.</b>
<br>
If you wish to book tickets through our Sites we will need to know your name, payment card details and your email address.  We may also need this information when you make any other purchases via our Sites, such as ordering food, drink, or 3D glasses.<br>
If you wish to purchase a gift from the Gifts section of our Sites we will need to know your name, payment card details and email address and where you ask us to send the gift to you by post, your delivery address.  Where you ask us to send the gift directly to the gift recipient, we will also need to know the name of the recipient and the delivery address for gifts sent by post or the name and email address of the recipient where gifts are sent by email.<br>
We use this Information to process and fulfil your orders and to send you service related emails for your booking or purchase.  We may also use these details to send you a follow-up service email after your cinema visit, to check that you were satisfied with our service.<br>
If you choose to pay for your purchases on our websites by credit, debit or charge card those payments will be processed by our payment provider rather than by us. If you use a Picturehouse gift card, e-gift code or other promotional code to pay for your purchases those payments may be processed by our gifts and promotions service providers rather than by us.<br>
We may also receive part of the payment details such as your name, email address and some of the digits of your payment card number from our payment processor.  These will be used to help connect your payment with your booking on our Site and may also be used by us if we provide you with a refund.

</ul>
<p><b>What is our legal basis?</b><br>
It is necessary for us to use your personal information to perform our obligations in accordance with any contract that we may have with you such as your contract with us for your ticket or gift purchase.  It is in our legitimate interest to use personal data of a gift recipient in order to provide them with the gifts purchased for them.</p>
<a href="#privacy-policy">Back to top</a>
<br><hr><br>
<h3 id="4.2">4.2 Verify the age of persons using our products and services</h3>
<p>We welcome children and young people to our cinemas.  However, some of our Services and features available on our Sites (including online ticket booking, Picturehouse membership and subscription to our newsletter and marketing emails) have age restrictions attached to their use.

<p>This means that we may need to ask you to provide your date of birth.</p> 
<p>We may also use your date of birth to understand more about our customers (see the <a href="#4.8">Customer Insight and Analysis</a> section for more details about our use of your personal information for this purpose).</p>
<p><b>What is our legal basis?</b><br>
Where we use your personal information to verify you or the person receiving our Services meets any age restrictions which we have set, it is in our legitimate interests to do so. Where we use your date of birth to prevent you from accessing age restricted films, we do so because this is necessary for us to comply with legal obligations to which we are subject. When you use our Services, it is also necessary for us to process your personal information for the purpose of performing our contract with you.</p>
