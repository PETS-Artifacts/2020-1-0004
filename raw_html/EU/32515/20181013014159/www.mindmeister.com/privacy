      <h3 class="mb-15">III. General information on data processing</h3>
      <h4>1. Scope of processing of personal data</h4>
      <p>
        We generally only process our users' personal data if we require this data to offer you the full functionality of our website, or if the information is required for access to our content and services. Users' personal data is usually only processed once the user provides their consent. The exception to this rule applies in cases in which it is not possible to obtain prior consent for practical reasons and the processing of this data without permission is permitted by law.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Legal basis for processing personal data</h4>
      <p>
        Article 6, section 1, item a) of the EU General Data Processing Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis for processing personal data in cases where the user has provided permission for us to do so.
        In cases where processing personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract that the user in question has signed, article 6, section 1, item b) of the GDPR applies. This also applies for processing procedures that are required for the performance of pre-contractual measures.
        If the processing of personal data is required for the fulfilment of legal obligations that our company is subject to, article 6, section 1, item c) of the GDPR applies.
        For cases in which the vital interests of the person concerned, or those of another natural person, make it necessary to process personal data, article 6, section 1, item d) of the GDPR applies.
        If the processing of personal data is necessary to safeguard the interests of our company or a third party, and the interest, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh these interests, article 6, section 1, item f) of the GDPR applies as the legal basis for processing data.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Erasure of data and duration of data storage</h4>
      <p>
        The personal data of the person concerned is deleted or blocked as soon as the data has served its purpose. Data may be stored beyond this period if provisions are made to this effect by European and national legislators in regulations, laws or other legal texts in accordance with the union law that the data controller is subject to. The data will also be deleted or blocked if the storage period specified in these regulations expires, unless the storage of this data for a longer period is required for the conclusion of a contract or the fulfilment of contractual obligations.
      </p>
      <h3 class="mb-15">IV. Provision of the website and creation of log files</h3>

      <h4>1. Description and scope of data processing</h4>
      <p>
        Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the user accessing the site.
        The following data is collected as part of this process:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">Information on the browser type and version</li>
        <li class="ml-35">The user's operating system</li>
        <li class="ml-35">The user's internet service provider</li>
        <li class="ml-35">The user's IP address</li>
        <li class="ml-35">The date and time of website access</li>
        <li class="ml-35">Website from which the user's system directs the user to our website</li>
        <li class="ml-35">Any websites the user's system accesses via our website</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Data is also stored in log files on our system. Neither this data nor any other personal data about the user is stored.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Legal basis for processing data</h4>
      <p>
        The legal basis for temporary storage of data and log files can be found in article 6, section 1, item f) of the GDPR.
      </p>

      <h4>3. Purpose of processing personal data</h4>
      <p>
        Temporary storage of IP addresses on the system is necessary in order to make the website available on the user's computer. The user's IP address must be stored for the duration of the session.

        IP addresses are stored in log files to ensure the functionality of the website. This data also helps us to optimise our website and ensure the security of our IT systems. Data stored in this way is not evaluated for marketing purposes.

        These purposes also constitute legitimate interest for processing data within the meaning of article 6, section 1, item f) of the GDPR.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Duration of storage</h4>
      <p>
        Data is deleted as soon as the purposes it has been collected for have been fulfilled. If the collection of data is necessary for the provision of the website, data is deleted as soon as the respective session is complete.

        If data is stored in log files, data will be deleted no more than 14 days after the website is accessed. It is possible that data will be stored for a longer period. In this case, the user's IP address is deleted or distorted, to ensure that the customer accessing the site can no longer be identified.
      </p>

      <h4>5. Revocation and deletion</h4>
      <p>
        The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of data in log files is essential to the operation of the website. There is therefore no possibility for the user to opt out.

      <h5>1.2 Google Analytics Remarketing</h5>
      <p>
        Our websites use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing combined with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.
        This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, identified based on your previous usage and surfing behaviour on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).
        Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.
        To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.
        You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.

For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Article 6, section 1, item f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in analysing anonymous user behaviour for promotional purposes.

      <h3 class="mb-15">XV. Rights of the data subject</h3>
      <p>
        The following list comprises all the rights of the data subject under the GDPR. You should not include any rights in your declaration that do not apply to your specific website. The list should be modified appropriately.
        If your personal data is processed, you are deemed a 'data subject' within the meaning of the GDPR and have the following rights.
      </p>
      <h4>1. Right to information</h4>
      <p>
        You may ask the data controller to confirm whether any personal data concerning you is processed by us.
        If this is the case, you can request the following information from the data controller:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">the purposes for which the personal data is processed;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the categories of personal data processed; </li>
        <li class="ml-35">the recipient or categories of recipients the respective personal data has been shared with or continues to be shared with;  </li>
        <li class="ml-35">the planned storage duration of the respective personal data or, if no specific information is available, the criteria for determining storage duration </li>
        <li class="ml-35">whether you have the right to rectification or erasure with regard to the respective personal data, the right to restriction of processing carried out by the data controller or the right to object to processing;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">whether you have the right to appeal to a supervisory authority;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">all available information regarding the origin of the data, if the personal data has not been collected from the data subject;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">whether an automated individual decision-making process including profiling exists in accordance with article 22, sections 1 and 4 of the GDPR and, in this case, what authoritative information is available on the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended effects of this type of processing on the data subject. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You have the right to request information regarding whether your personal data is shared with another country or state, or to an international organisation. In this regard, you may request information on the appropriate guarantees in accordance with article 46 of the GDPR in relation to transfer of data.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Right to rectification</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to obtain from the data controller rectification and/or completion of your data if the processed data concerning you is inaccurate or incomplete. The data controller is required to make the correction without undue delay.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Right to restriction of processing</h4>
      <p>
        Under the following circumstances, you may request the restriction of processing of any of your personal data:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">if you contest the accuracy of your personal data for a period of time that enables the data controller to verify the accuracy of your personal information;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">if the processing is unlawful and you refuse the erasure of the personal data in favour of restricted use of the personal data;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the data controller no longer requires the personal data for processing purposes, but you require it for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">You have objected to processing pursuant to article 21, section 1 of the GDPR pending verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override your own.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If the processing of your data is restricted, this data will – with the exception of storage – only be processed with your consent or for the establishment, exercise of defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a member state.
        If you have obtained restriction of processing pursuant to the aforementioned provisions, you will be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.
      </p>
      <h4>4. Right to erasure</h4>
      <h5>a) Erasure obligation</h5>
      <p>
        You may request from the data controller that your personal data be deleted without undue delay. The data controller is under obligation to delete the data without undue delay if any of the following points apply:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to article 6, section 1, item a), or article 9, section 2 GDPR, and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to article 21, section 1 GDPR and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to article 21, section 2 GDPR;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the personal data has been unlawfully processed;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the personal data has to be deleted for compliance with a legal obligation in the Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the personal data has been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in article 8, section 1.</li>
      </ol>
      <h5>b) Information for third parties</h5>
      <p>
        Where the data controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to article 17, section 1 GDPR to delete the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers who are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, that personal data.
      </p>
      <h5>c) Exceptions</h5>
      <p>
        Right to erasure does not apply to the extent that processing is necessary
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">for reasons of public interest in the area of public health in accordance with article 9, section 2, items h), and i), and article 9, section 3 of the GDPR.</li>
        <li class="ml-35">for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89, section 1 of the GDPR in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing, or</li>
        <li class="ml-35">for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>5. Right to notification</h4>
      <p>
        If you have the right to notification, erasure or restriction of processing, the data controller is required to communicate this rectification, erasure or restriction to all recipients to whom the personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort.
        You have the right to be informed by the data controller about these recipients.
      </p>
      <h4>6. Right to data portability</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to receive any personal data you have provided to the data controller in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. You also have the right to transmit this data to another data controller without hindrance from the controller to which you have provided your data, if
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">the processing is based on consent pursuant to article 6, section 1, item a) of the GDPR or article 9, section 2, item a) of the GDPR or on a contract pursuant to article 6, section 1, item b) of the GDPR; and</li>
        <li class="ml-35">the processing is carried out by automated means.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In exercising this right, you also have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible. This must not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.
        The right to portability does not apply to the processing of personal data necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller.
      </p>
      <h4>7. Right to object</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of your personal data based on article 6 section 1 item e) or f) of the GDPR, including profiling based on those provisions.
        The data controller will no longer process the personal data unless they demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
        If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to processing of your personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
        If you object to processing for direct marketing purposes, your personal data will no longer be processed for such purposes.
        In the context of the use of information society services and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, you have the option to exercise your right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
      </p>
      <h4>8. Right to revoke the data protection consent declaration</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right to revoke your data protection consent declaration at any time. Revocation of consent does not affect the legality of any processing carried out on the basis of consent prior to revocation. In the event of revocation of your consent, we are currently no longer able to make our products available to you for technical reasons.
      </p>
      <h4>9. Automated individual decision-making, including profiling</h4>
      <p>
        You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects that concern you or affects you in a similarly significant way. This does not apply if the decision
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li class="ml-35">is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between you and the data controller;</li>
        <li class="ml-35">is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard your own rights and freedoms and legitimate interests or</li>
        <li class="ml-35">is based on your explicit consent</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These decisions must be not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9, section 1 of the GDPR, unless article 9, section 2, item a) or g) of the GDPR apply and suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.
        In the cases referred to in points (1) and (3), the data controller will implement suitable measures to safeguard your rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express your point of view and to contest the decision.
      </p>
      <h4>10. Right to complain to a supervisory authority</h4>
      <p>
        Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to complain to a supervisory authority, in particular in the member state you are a resident of, your place of work, or place of alleged infringement if you believe that the processing of your personal data violates the provisions of the GDPR.
        The supervisory authority to which the complaint has been submitted must inform the complainant of the status and results of the complaint, including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to article 78 of the GDPR.
