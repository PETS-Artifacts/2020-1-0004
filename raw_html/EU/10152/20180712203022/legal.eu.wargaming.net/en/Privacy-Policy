<h2>9. Game Rules</h2>

<p>9.1 The Game Rules set out how we expect you to behave when playing the Game. Please review the Game Rules carefully before playing the Game. Please note that 'role-playing' is not an excuse for contravening the Game Rules.

<p>9.2 If you are in material breach with the Game Rules, then we may, at our reasonably discretion depending on the seriousness of the breach take some or all of the following actions:

<ul>
 	<li>(a) suspend your access to the "game chat" functionality in the Game for a short period of time;</li>
 	<li>(b) suspend your access to the "game chat" functionality in the Game for a longer period of time; and</li>
 	<li>(c) suspend or close your Account as provided in the Terms of Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the breach is your first breach, if it is not flagrant, if it is capable of cure, and if the circumstances allow us to do so, then we shall give you 14 (fourteen) calendar days prior written notice of the impending Account closure to give you the opportunity to cure the breach during such time period. If we suspend your Account, then during the period of that suspension you will not be able to access your Account or use any of the Services. If we close your Account, then you will never be able to access your Account and we may also prohibit you from accessing or using the Services in future.

<p>9.3 If we suspend your access to the 'game chat' functionality in the Game, then during the period of that suspension you will be able to play the Game and read the 'game chat' of other players, but will not be able to participate in 'game chat'.

<p>9.4. Game Rules for specific Games may contain other restrictions depending on the nature of the Game and its functionalities. In case of any discrepancies between this section 9 and Game Rules for a specific Game, the latter shall prevail.

<p>9.5 If you encounter another user who is contravening any of the Game Rules, please report this activity to Wargaming using the "Help" or "Report Abuse" functions in the Game if available, or otherwise contact Customer Support at <a href="https://eu.wargaming.net/support/">https://eu.wargaming.net/support/</a> or, for Gods &amp; Glory, <a href="mailto:support_en@godsandglory.com">support_en@godsandglory.com</a>.

<h2>10. Epilepsy Warning</h2>

<p>Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain monitor images or playing certain video games. This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor. Please also note that when using a video game you should take certain standard health and safety precautions, including avoiding playing the game when tired and not had much sleep, taking 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour, sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, and playing the game in a well-lit environment.

<p><strong>3. GENERAL INFORMATION IN BRIEF</strong>

<p>We process personal data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.

<p>Our legitimate interests are to provide our Services in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Services.

<p><strong>3.1. YOUR PREFERENCES</strong>

<p>You can choose how we use your Personal Data using our Account Management Tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management Tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>.

<p>For example, through the Account Management Tool you can: 

<ul>
<li>•	opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 7.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
<li>access the Personal Data we store about you. Read more below in Section 7.2 “Right of Access”;
<li>have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section  7.4 “Right to erasure”. 
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>

<p>We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. 

<p><strong>3.3. PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES</strong> 

<p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 6 “How we share your information”.

<p><strong>3.4. CHILDREN</strong>

<p>We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law).

<p><strong>3.5. DATA RETENTION</strong>

<p>We keep most of your Personal Data gathered and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Services, e.g. you have an activated Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account deletion and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 7.3 “Right to erasure”.

<p><strong>3.6. GAMES NOT USING THE ACCOUNT</strong> 

<p>Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete it, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 7 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions. 

<p>Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games. For example, we do not collect your phone number and email address if you use the Games for which the Account is not created.

<p>With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by filing a request to that effect to Customer Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game. 

<p>Finally, you may link some of the Games that do not use the Account to your Account (where such function is available). Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Customer Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management.

<p><strong>4.2.2. Game-Related Information, Device Information, Geo-Location</strong>

<p>In order to provide you with efficient services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Games. “<strong>Game-Related Information</strong>” includes your in-game identifier, which for most of our Games is known as “Wargaming ID”, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about your Games preferences, progress in the Games, participation in clans, frequency of playing, as well as information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

<p><strong>4.2.3. Information required for fraud and violations detection</strong>

<p>We may also collect certain data (like IP address, username, etc.) that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game, and is deleted six months after its collection, unless the data can be used to prove that cheating has occurred. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations. 

<p><strong>4.2.4. Information from publicly available online resources</strong>

<p>We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Services, so that we could take them into account while improving our Services.

<p><strong>4.2.5. Information from our partners</strong>

<p>In order to fulfil our obligation under the EULA and when processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We also use your identifiers on other platforms like PlayStation®4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, so that you can play our games through these platforms. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their instructions and applicable laws. When you purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "gold") or time-limited premium memberships with your credit card, we may receive from our payment partners and process a part of your credit card number, information about your credit card issuer, as well as your full address for billing purposes.

<p><strong>5. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>We need to process your Personal Data in order to fulfil the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

<ul>
<li>to provide you with the Services you request; 
<li>to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies;
<li>to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;
<li>to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.
</ul>

<p><strong>5.1. COMMUNICATION PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.

<p><strong>5.2. SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We analyse the Tracking Data, Content Data and Game-Related Information to identify how to improve the Services and our operations to make them more interesting for our players in general. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys and you have choices about the information you provide.

<p><strong>5.3. TARGETED IN-GAME OFFERS</strong>

<p>We may also use the Game-Related Information to send you certain in-game offers that we believe are the most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify whether you follow the pattern, if we apply the algorithm and it says that you do actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offer to you. We make sure that such offers never have any significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.

<p><strong>5.4. FRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION</strong>

<p>We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game rules and policies only for the purposes of such detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

<p><strong>6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties. We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.

<p><strong>Sharing anonymous information.</strong> We also may share anonymous information, i.e. information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.

<p><strong>7. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>

<p>To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management.  If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a> or – for Console Games – <a href="https://console.worldoftanks.com/">here</a>. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.

<p><strong>7.1. OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>

<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone and are not specifically directed to you.

<p>You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).

<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

<p><strong>7.2. RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>

<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc. 

<p><strong>7.3. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>

<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country, social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate. 

<p><strong>7.4. RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>

<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools.

<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for. 

<p><strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request. 

<p><strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.

<p><strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:

<ul>
<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 30 (thirty) days of us sending the award to your address;
<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, vk.com for the period when <li>we are generating the reports for our Services improvement and for 30 (thirty) days after that; 
technical logs such as records of communication between Services, access logs, errors logs: normally within 30 (thirty) days from their creation.
</ul>

<p><strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.

<p><strong>8. WE CAN CHANGE THIS POLICY</strong>

<p>We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected.</div>

<p>and form part of these Terms of Service.</p> <p>1.3 In these Terms of Service we refer to the Games, the Games Forums and the Ancillary Services together as the "<strong>Services</strong>".</p> <h2>2. Users under the Age of 18</h2> <p>2.1 If you are under the age of eighteen (18), please ask your parent or guardian to read and accept these Terms of Service on your behalf before you use the Services. If you (or, if applicable, your parent or guardian) do not agree to these Terms of Service, then you may not use or access the Services or any part thereof. By signing up for an Account (see below, section 5 "Your Wargaming Account"), you represent and warrant that you are a "natural person" who is over the age of eighteen (18) or whose legal guardian have accepted and agreed to these Terms of Service.</p> <p>2.2 You agree that you will not knowingly allow any individual under the age of eighteen (18) to use or access the Services without a parent or legal guardian supervising him or her.</p> <h2>3. Amendments to the Terms of Service and the Forum Rules</h2> <p>3.1 From time to time, we may need to amend these Terms of Service, for example to reflect or include new products or services, to enhance security for our users or because of changes in the law. Also, we may from time to time need to amend the <a href="http://forum.worldofwarplanes.eu/index.php?/forum-21/announcement-17-forum-rules/">Forum Rules</a> for serious reasons, for example to ensure that the Games Forums operate smoothly and to reflect the needs of the community using the Games Forums. If we make such a change to these Terms of Service and/or to the Forum Rules, we will inform you of the particular changes in advance via e-mail no later than thirty (30) calendar days before such changes come into force and that you shall be deemed to have accepted these changes (i) unless you have notified us of your objection to such changes within thirty (30) calendar days from the moment of receipt the e-mail notification from us, or (ii) if you use the Services after the changes have entered into force. In the e-mail notification, we will inform you of your right to object, of the applicable notice period and the legal consequences of a failure to object.</p> <p>3.2 In case you object to any changes as set out in article 1 of this present section 3 "Amendments to the Terms of Service and the Forum Rules", the previous version of the respective Terms of Service and/or Forum Rules shall continue to apply. However, in that case we have the right to close your Account and terminate these Terms of Service with fourteen (14) calendar days’ notice. In case of such termination, you are entitled to a refund according to article 2 of section 13 "Suspension and Closure of Your Account / Termination of these Terms of Service".</p> <p>3.3 The latest version of these Terms of Service and of the Forum Rules will always be available on the Sites, so we recommend that you check for updates to these Terms of Service and to the Forum Rules each time you use the Services. Changes to the Terms of Service and/or the Forum Rules shall not affect your accrued rights, shall not substantially disrupt the contractual balance between you and us under these Terms of Service and shall not have retroactive effect.</p> <h2>4. The Terms of Service, the Privacy and Cookie Policy and the End User Licence Agreement</h2> <p>4.1 Our <a href="?Privacy-Policy">Privacy and Cookie Policy</a> sets out how we will respect your privacy and how we use data collected by the Services.</p> <p>4.2 In order to access and use any of our Games, in addition to accepting these Terms of Service and the <a href="?Privacy-Policy">Privacy and Cookie Policy</a>, you must also accept the End User Licence Agreement (the "<strong>EULA</strong>") applicable to the relevant Game together with the game rules applicable to the relevant Game (the "<strong>Game Rules</strong>"). We set out here the link to the <a href="?EULA">EULA</a>.</p> <p>You must also accept and comply with all rules of external platforms applicable to specific Game, including but not limited to, Xbox® Games and other Xbox® services rules, PlayStation®4 licences and other Sony rules, Apple Appstore and Game Center rules, and Google Play<sup>TM</sup> rules. Any breach of any rules of the external platforms shall also be regarded as a fundamental breach of the Terms of Service by you.</p> <p>4.3 <strong>If you do not want to accept the Terms of Service or the </strong><a href="?Privacy-Policy">Privacy and Cookie Policy</a><strong>, then you may not use or access any of the Services. If you do not accept the EULA and the Game Rules applicable to a Game, then you may not download or use that Game.</strong></p> <h2>5. Your Wargaming Account</h2> <h3>Creating an Account</h3> <p>5.1 In order to use the Services, you will need to create a Wargaming account (an "<strong>Account</strong>").</p> <p>5.2 To create an Account, you must have an e-mail address and will be required to provide certain information. The details of the information that you need to provide are set out in our <a href="?Privacy-Policy">Privacy and Cookie Policy</a>. It is important that you provide this information truthfully and accurately, so that we have correct details about you and your Account.</p> <p>5.3 When creating an Account you will also be required to provide a 'user name' and/or 'persona' to represent you in a Game and on our Sites. User names and personas are tied to your Account (meaning they cannot be transferred to anyone else). You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise breaches these Terms of Service. If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us at <a href="https://eu.wargaming.net/support/">https://eu.wargaming.net/support/</a>.</p> <p>5.4 Specifically, in order to use the Services for Xbox® 360 or Xbox® One Games, you will need to visit the <a href="http://console.worldoftanks.com/">site</a> and sign in using your Microsoft Xbox® Live ID credentials. The Account will be automatically created using your Microsoft Xbox® Live ID credentials (e-mail and nick name (gamertag)).</p> <p>In cases, including some iOS and Android Games you may also log in through some third party system, if expressly permitted in the Game.</p> <p>To access the Services for PlayStation®4 Games, you need to have a Sony Entertainment Network account. </p> <p>5.5 Also, if expressly permitted by Wargaming, a "demo account" is possible in certain Games. In this case, you receive no separate username or password. The authorization for the Game is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use.</p> <p>However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a "demo account" is used, we are not responsible to keep your progress in the Game, ensure availability of game items and Virtual Goods or safety of any monetary or valuable assets in the Account. Cases when an Account and all connected assets may be lost entirely include the loss of the technical device, loss of password or any unauthorized modification of the operating system ("jailbreaking") or of the software.</p> <h3>Account Sharing</h3> <p>5.6 You must keep all information relating to your Account confidential. At no time should you disclose your Account ID or password, secret question or answer to anyone. This includes your friends, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members, and/or clan leaders. </p> <p>5.7 You may, under circumstances, be responsible for the conduct and actions using your Account and for all breaches of these Terms of Service committed by using your Account which are due your culpable omissions or conduct as regards your Account information. We shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from any unauthorised use of your Account or any unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information based on your culpable omissions or conduct as regards your Account information.</p> <h3>Security of Your Account</h3> <p>5.8 You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device from third party access. Please notify us immediately at <a href="https://eu.wargaming.net/support/">https://eu.wargaming.net/support/</a> if you become aware of: </p> <ul> <li>a) any unauthorised use of your Account or any other breach of security; or</li> <li>b) any hacking tools being used or that might be used in relation to the Services.</li> </ul> <p>5.9 We have implemented physical, electronic and managerial procedures in order to help safeguard and prevent unauthorised access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use reasonable efforts to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made by e-mail are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to interception during transmission.</p> <h2>6. Charges and Billing</h2> <p>6.1 You do not have to pay any registration or subscription fees to create an Account. However, some of the Services may require you to pay a fee. If you decide to subscribe to any such Services, you must ensure that:</p> <ul> <li>a) you are either over the age of eighteen (18) or, if you are under the age of eighteen (18), that your parent or guardian has agreed to and accepted the respective purchase and these Terms of Service on your behalf; </li> <li>b) you are the authorised Account holder for the Account from which you are subscribing to the Services;</li> <li>c) you are authorised to use the particular credit card or other accepted method of payment;</li> <li>d) all information that you submit is true and accurate (this includes, without limitation, your credit card number and expiration date, so it is important to keep these details updated); and</li> <li>e) you agree to pay all the fees that you incur, unless and until you close your Account and terminate these Terms of Service in accordance with these Terms of Service.</li> </ul> <p>6.2 Any applicable fees and other charges on your Account for Services fully provided by us are not refundable, except as set forth in these Terms of Service, or as it is required under the applicable law. </p> <p>6.3 Please remember that your Account is personal to you and cannot be transferred or traded with any other user.</p> <p>6.4 IF YOU ARE PLAYING OUR GAMES ON EXTERNAL PLATFORMS SUCH AS MICROSOFT XBOX®, SONY PLAYSTATION®, APPLE IOS OR GOOGLE ANDROID<sup>TM</sup>, YOU MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET BY THOSE THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS. THE CHARGING AND BILLING IN SUCH GAMES ARE SUBJECT TO RULES OF THE THOSE PLATFORMS. WARGAMING DISCLAIMES ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE FOR SUCH PLATFORMS’ ACTIONS.</p> <h2>7. Content</h2> <p>7.1 The Services contain a lot of content, including, but not limited to software, technology, text, forum posts, chat posts, profiles, widgets, messages, links, e-mails, music, sound, graphics, pictures or video materials, as well as the design and appearance of our Sites and the Games (the "<strong>Content</strong>"). Some parts of the Content may only be accessible online and/or require using keys or codes, serial codes and/or online authentication of any kind and in-game achievements in order to be unlocked. </p> <p>7.2 The Content and all of the intellectual property rights in the Content are owned by us (or by our affiliates and partners as applicable). However, during the time these Terms of Service are in force between you and us, we grant you a personal right (known as a 'licence') to use the Content in connection with your access and use of the Services. This licence is:</p> <ul> <li>a) 'non-exclusive' (meaning that we can grant the same and similar licences to other people as well); </li> <li>b) 'revocable' (meaning that we can terminate this licence in certain circumstances, which are explained further below); </li> <li>c) 'personal' (meaning that you may not use the Content for any commercial purpose);</li> <li>d) 'non-transferable' (meaning that the licence is only for your benefit and you may not transfer or sub-licence any of the rights that we grant to you to any other person);</li> <li>e) 'limited' (meaning that you can only use the Content for the purposes we set out in these Terms of Service); and</li> <li>f) conditional on your compliance with these Terms of Service, Game Rules, Forum Rules and the EULA.</li> </ul> <p>7.3 Unless and to the extent that we have expressly authorised you in writing, you must not: </p> <ul> <li>a) copy or download any Content from the Service or any part thereof (except as part of the proper use or operation of the Services);</li> <li>b) distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, distribute, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of the Content;</li> <li>c) make any commercial use (i.e. for profit) of any Content; or </li> <li>d) remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to the Content.</li> </ul> <p>7.4 Wargaming will do its best to make the Content available to you as a part of your enjoyment of the Services, but this is subject to some rules which we need in order to ensure efficient running of the Services:</p> <ul> <li>a) we can only make the Content available to you if it is legal for you to have access to the Content in your home country;</li> <li>b) you may only obtain the Content from us (or from any person that we authorise for this purpose) and you must not obtain Content from any other person or attempt to do so;</li> <li>c) we reserve the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire the Content, and we also reserve the right to limit or block any request to acquire or obtain Content at our reasonable discretion, in particular insofar as there are technical issues and/or legal restrictions e.g. under copyright law, criminal law, youth protection law etc.;</li> <li>d) we do not guarantee that any of the Content will be available at all times, in all countries and/or all geographic locations, or at any given time or that we will continue to offer any particular Content for any particular period of time (unless we expressly say otherwise as part of the Services); </li> <li>e) the Content you have access to is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content or for cash, or other goods or services, unless otherwise provided in the present Terms of Service or as permitted in the Services; and</li> <li>f) we may have to change or update the Content from time to time, but we will post details of any changes in the news section of the relevant Site(s). </li> </ul> <h2>8. Virtual Goods</h2> <p>8.1 The Services may permit you to purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "<strong>Gold</strong>") or time-limited premium memberships (virtual items, virtual currency and premium memberships together "<strong>Virtual Goods</strong>"). </p> <p>8.2 The following provisions apply to the purchase of Virtual Goods. To purchase Virtual Goods, you need to have an Account.</p> <ul> <li>a) To conduct a purchase of Virtual Goods at the Site, you have to click on the "Get Gold" button. Once you get to our premium shop you can then choose the Virtual Goods, which you would like to purchase. The respective price in Euro, US-Dollar or the currency applicable to your region, for the Virtual Good you would like to purchase, will be displayed. You then may choose a payment method and enter your respective payment details. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase. If your payment is in a currency other than that of the purchase amount shown on the website, the exchange rate applied on the payment date will depend on the selected payment method.</li> <li>b) Before you confirm your purchase by clicking on the "Purchase Now" button (or a likewise conspicuously labelled button concluding the purchase process), or by fulfilling another action required (e.g. sending a message, etc.), you will have the opportunity to review your purchase details, i.e. the particular Virtual Goods including its amount, if applicable, and respective total price including all taxes, and to correct any errors. To correct any errors you should go back to our premium shop, e.g. by clicking on the "Back" button of your browser.</li> <li>c) By clicking the "Purchase Now" button (or the likewise conspicuously labelled button concluding the purchase process), or by fulfilling another action required (e.g. sending a message, etc.), you are sending an order to us to purchase the confirmed amount of Virtual Goods. If you have provided valid payment details within your Account, we will process your order. You will be notified of our acceptance or denial of your order by us on your screen within a few minutes from the moment of clicking the "Purchase Now" button (or the likewise conspicuously labelled button concluding the purchase process) or fulfilling the respective other action required (e.g. sending a message, etc.).</li> <li>d) In case we accept your order, we will directly thereafter credit the purchased Virtual Goods to your Account and we will charge you via the selected payment method. You will also receive a confirmation of your purchase via e-mail, containing the contract details (the "<strong>Purchase Contract</strong>") and these Terms of Service. Other than that, we will not store the Purchase Contract text and wording and it will not be accessible to you after conclusion of the Purchase Contract. </li> <li>e) The Purchase Contract will be concluded in the language of the country where you live, or in the English language, unless otherwise provided under the applicable consumer protection law.</li> </ul> <p>8.3 We set out below the rules that apply to Virtual Goods:</p> <ul> <li>a) Virtual Goods may only be redeemed for other Virtual Goods where permitted in the Services;</li> <li>b) once you have purchased Virtual Goods, those Virtual Goods are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them), except as set forth in these Terms of Service, or as it is required under the applicable law;</li> <li>c) Virtual Goods cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Virtual Goods for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game; </li> <li>d) Virtual Goods cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Virtual Goods as permitted in the Services);</li> <li>e) we do not make any promises about how or when Virtual Goods may be available for purchase and can update or change Virtual Goods available for purchase at any time;</li> <li>f) you may only acquire Virtual Goods from us (or from any person that we authorise for this purpose) or from another user of the Game as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game, and you must not obtain Virtual Goods from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and</li> <li>g) we may limit or block a request to acquire Virtual Goods for any reason.</li> </ul> <p>8.4 Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal</p> <p><strong>Right of Withdrawal</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>You have the right to withdraw from any Purchase Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason.

All rights reserved.</p> <p>This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:</p> <p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1</p> <p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:</p> <p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</p> <p>b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;</p> <p>c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</p> <p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p> <p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p> <p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</p> <p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p> <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p> <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.</p> <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p> <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p> <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p> <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p> <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p> <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

<p><strong>3. GENERAL INFORMATION IN BRIEF</strong>

<p>We process personal data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.

<p>Our legitimate interests are to provide our Services in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Services.

<p><strong>3.1. YOUR PREFERENCES</strong>

<p>You can choose how we use your Personal Data using our Account Management Tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management Tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>.

<p>For example, through the Account Management Tool you can: 

<ul>
<li>•	opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 7.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
<li>access the Personal Data we store about you. Read more below in Section 7.2 “Right of Access”;
<li>have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section  7.4 “Right to erasure”. 
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>

<p>We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. 

<p><strong>3.3. PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES</strong> 

<p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 6 “How we share your information”.

<p><strong>3.4. CHILDREN</strong>

<p>We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law).

<p><strong>3.5. DATA RETENTION</strong>

<p>We keep most of your Personal Data gathered and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Services, e.g. you have an activated Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account deletion and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 7.3 “Right to erasure”.

<p><strong>3.6. GAMES NOT USING THE ACCOUNT</strong> 

<p>Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete it, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 7 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions. 

<p>Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games. For example, we do not collect your phone number and email address if you use the Games for which the Account is not created.

<p>With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by filing a request to that effect to Customer Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game. 

<p>Finally, you may link some of the Games that do not use the Account to your Account (where such function is available). Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Customer Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management.

<p><strong>4.2.2. Game-Related Information, Device Information, Geo-Location</strong>

<p>In order to provide you with efficient services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Games. “<strong>Game-Related Information</strong>” includes your in-game identifier, which for most of our Games is known as “Wargaming ID”, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about your Games preferences, progress in the Games, participation in clans, frequency of playing, as well as information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

<p><strong>4.2.3. Information required for fraud and violations detection</strong>

<p>We may also collect certain data (like IP address, username, etc.) that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game, and is deleted six months after its collection, unless the data can be used to prove that cheating has occurred. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations. 

<p><strong>4.2.4. Information from publicly available online resources</strong>

<p>We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Services, so that we could take them into account while improving our Services.

<p><strong>4.2.5. Information from our partners</strong>

<p>In order to fulfil our obligation under the EULA and when processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We also use your identifiers on other platforms like PlayStation®4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, so that you can play our games through these platforms. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their instructions and applicable laws. When you purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "gold") or time-limited premium memberships with your credit card, we may receive from our payment partners and process a part of your credit card number, information about your credit card issuer, as well as your full address for billing purposes.

<p><strong>5. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>We need to process your Personal Data in order to fulfil the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

<ul>
<li>to provide you with the Services you request; 
<li>to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies;
<li>to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;
<li>to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.
</ul>

<p><strong>5.1. COMMUNICATION PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.

<p><strong>5.2. SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We analyse the Tracking Data, Content Data and Game-Related Information to identify how to improve the Services and our operations to make them more interesting for our players in general. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys and you have choices about the information you provide.

<p><strong>5.3. TARGETED IN-GAME OFFERS</strong>

<p>We may also use the Game-Related Information to send you certain in-game offers that we believe are the most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify whether you follow the pattern, if we apply the algorithm and it says that you do actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offer to you. We make sure that such offers never have any significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.

<p><strong>5.4. FRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION</strong>

<p>We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game rules and policies only for the purposes of such detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

<p><strong>6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>For the performance of a contract with you, compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, and based on our legitimate interests, we may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties:

<ol>
<li><strong>Payment partners:</strong> we share your email address, IP address, information about in-game purchases requested by you at Wargaming’s web-sites, and other information you provide to us for the purpose of fulfilling your purchase requests with such companies as Adyen BV, PW Inc., PayPal (Europe) Sarl &amp; Cie, "Yandex.Money", NBCO LLC;  
<li><strong>Advertising and advertising measurement partners:</strong> we share your email, nickname, IP address and other information you provide to us in order to facilitate targeting, delivery, and measurement of online advertising on third-party services, or otherwise facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, or of interest to you, with such companies as Emarsys UK Ltd, Unity Technologies APS; 
<li><strong>Data storage partners:</strong> we store some of your information using third-party data storage services, e.g. we store most of your responses to our in-game questionnaires using the services of Widgix, LLC dba Survey Gizmo, while some of your game statistics is stored using the services of Amazon Web Services, Inc.; 
<li><strong>Research partners:</strong> we may provide access to some of your data, such as your Game statistics, to provide marketing-related and other research. We share anonymous data with our partners unless your personal data is necessary for the requested services or research;
<li><strong>Customer support partners:</strong> for some territories and products we engage third parties to provide you with appropriate customer support services. Such companies may get access to your personal data, including personal data that you may provide in your customer support requests. Such partners include Zendesk Inc, iOpex Technologies Inc.;
<li><strong>Developers of applications based on the Game:</strong> we make your nickname and some of your Game statistics available to other players and our partners through Public API. The data can be used for developing and support of the applications created by the Game community, mobile applications, e.g. World of Tanks Assistant. Public API enables us to improve your gaming experience, fulfil potential of our community, and put use of our players’ statistics under our control by creating rules and requirements for their use by other players and community;
<li><strong>Publicly available information:</strong> our Sites may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, please use our Account Management tool to request its removal. If we may not be able to remove your personal information promptly, we will let you know about the reasons.
<li><strong>External moderators and testers:</strong> some limited data about you (such as your nickname, content of customer support ticket) may become available to third party volunteering moderators and testers who contribute to providing you with better Services, e.g. to quickly respond to your questions about the Games. 
<li><strong>Anti-cheat and anti-fraud companies:</strong> we may share the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Games and EULA violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game.
<li><strong>Wargaming subsidiaries and affiliates:</strong> as a global company, we collect information that may be processed in our offices worldwide. Your information may also be processed outside of the European Economic Area, e.g. in the United States, the Republic of Belarus, or any other country in which we, our affiliates or subsidiaries maintain presence.
<li><strong>Change of control:</strong> we may share your data as part of our company’s sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any entity which buys us, or part of our business will have the right to continue using your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
</ol>

<p>When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties. We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.

<p><strong>Sharing anonymous information.</strong> We also may share anonymous information, i.e. information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.

<p><strong>7. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>

<p>To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management.  If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a> or – for Console Games – <a href="https://console.worldoftanks.com/">here</a>. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.

<p><strong>7.1. OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>

<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone and are not specifically directed to you.

<p>You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).

<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

<p><strong>7.2. RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>

<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc. 

<p><strong>7.3. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>

<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country, social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate. 

<p><strong>7.4. RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>

<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools.

<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for. 

<p><strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request. 

<p><strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.

<p><strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:

<ul>
<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 30 (thirty) days of us sending the award to your address;
<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, vk.com for the period when <li>we are generating the reports for our Services improvement and for 30 (thirty) days after that; 
technical logs such as records of communication between Services, access logs, errors logs: normally within 30 (thirty) days from their creation.
</ul>

<p><strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.

<p><strong>8. WE CAN CHANGE THIS POLICY</strong>

<p>We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected.</div>
