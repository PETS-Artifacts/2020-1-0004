Epilepsy Warning</h2> <p>Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain monitor images or playing certain video games. This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor.

To purchase Virtual Goods, you need to have an Account.</p> <ul> <li>a) To conduct a purchase of Virtual Goods at the Site, you have to click on the "Get Gold" button. Once you get to our premium shop you can then choose the Virtual Goods, which you would like to purchase. The respective price in Euro, US-Dollar or the currency applicable to your region, for the Virtual Good you would like to purchase, will be displayed. You then may choose a payment method and enter your respective payment details. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase.

You will be notified of our acceptance or denial of your order by us on your screen within a few minutes from the moment of clicking the "Purchase Now" button (or the likewise conspicuously labelled button concluding the purchase process) or fulfilling the respective other action required (e.g. sending a message, etc.).</li> <li>d) In case we accept your order, we will directly thereafter credit the purchased Virtual Goods to your Account and we will charge you via the selected payment method. You will also receive a confirmation of your purchase via e-mail, containing the contract details (the "<strong>Purchase Contract</strong>") and these Terms of Service. Other than that, we will not store the Purchase Contract text and wording and it will not be accessible to you after conclusion of the Purchase Contract. </li> <li>e) The Purchase Contract will be concluded in the language of the country where you live, or in the English language, unless otherwise provided under the applicable consumer protection law.</li> </ul> <p>8.3 We set out below the rules that apply to Virtual Goods:</p> <ul> <li>a) Virtual Goods may only be redeemed for other Virtual Goods where permitted in the Services;</li> <li>b) once you have purchased Virtual Goods, those Virtual Goods are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them), except as set forth in these Terms of Service, or as it is required under the applicable law;</li> <li>c) Virtual Goods cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Virtual Goods for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game; </li> <li>d) Virtual Goods cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Virtual Goods as permitted in the Services);</li> <li>e) we do not make any promises about how or when Virtual Goods may be available for purchase and can update or change Virtual Goods available for purchase at any time;</li> <li>f) you may only acquire Virtual Goods from us (or from any person that we authorise for this purpose) or from another user of the Game as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game, and you must not obtain Virtual Goods from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and</li> <li>g) we may limit or block a request to acquire Virtual Goods for any reason.</li> </ul> <p>8.4 Information concerning the exercise of the right of withdrawal</p> <p><strong>Right of Withdrawal</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>You have the right to withdraw from any Purchase Contract within 14 calendar days without giving any reason. The withdrawal period will expire after 14 calendar days from the day of the conclusion of the Purchase Contract. </strong> <br><strong>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us,</strong> <br><strong>Wargaming Group Limited</strong> <br><strong>105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus</strong> <br><strong>e-mail: wf@wargaming.net</strong> <br><strong>phone: +357 22 864444</strong> <br><strong>fax: +357 22 864454</strong> <br><strong>of your decision to withdraw from a Purchase Contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post, fax or e-mail). You may use the model withdrawal form you find under </strong><a href="http://content.wargaming.net/Withdrawal%20Form.docx">http://content.wargaming.net/Withdrawal%20Form.docx</a><strong>, but it is not obligatory.</strong></li> <li><strong>You can also electronically fill in and submit a withdrawal form on our website via this link: </strong><a href="https://eu.wargaming.net/support/kb/articles/600">https://eu.wargaming.net/support/kb/articles/600</a><strong>.

We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</strong></li> <li><strong>If you requested to begin the performance of services under a Purchase Contract during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from that Purchase Contract, in comparison with the full coverage of these services under the Purchase Contract.</strong></li> <li><strong>You lose your right of withdrawal, insofar as the Purchase Contract is a service contract, after the service has been fully performed and if the performance has begun with the your prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that you will lose your right of withdrawal once the service has been fully performed by us.</strong></li> <li><strong>You lose your right of withdrawal insofar as the Purchase Contract comprises the supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with your prior express consent and your acknowledgment that you thereby lose your right of withdrawal.</strong></li> </ul> <p>Based on the aforesaid you understand that by purchasing Virtual Goods, you consent that we make available these Virtual Goods to you directly after we have accepted your order. You will lose your right of withdrawal once the Virtual Goods have been made fully available to you by us. However, your right of withdrawal is not lost if you purchase Virtual Goods that are granted to you for a certain period of time (e.g. time-limited premium memberships).</p> <p>8.5 Please note that due to technical limitations we cannot warrant that payments made by you via a specific payment method will be reimbursed to you via that same payment method:</p> <p><strong>You agree that reimbursements for such payments can be facilitated by us via another, common means of payment, e.g. via transfer of money to your bank account, in case reimbursements via these payment methods are technically impossible. In any case, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</strong></p> <p>8.6 Applicable consumer protection law, in particular your right of withdrawal under article 4 of section 8 "Virtual Goods and Virtual Currency", will not in any way be restricted by the present Terms of Service.</p> <p>8.7 The following rules apply in regard to the gifts made through the Premium Shop: </p> <ul> <li>a) <strong>As of the latest ToS update, gifts are only available in World of Tanks and World of Warplanes.

All rights reserved.</p> <p>This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:</p> <p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1</p> <p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:</p> <p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</p> <p>b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;</p> <p>c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</p> <p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p> <p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p> <p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</p> <p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p> <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p> <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.</p> <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p> <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p> <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p> <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p> <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p> <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

These descriptions can help you determine if and how you would like to interact with our Sites and other online services:</li> <ul> <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies</strong> <br>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to navigate the Sites and use certain features. Without these strictly necessary cookies, the online services provided by the Sites cannot be provided. It is therefore not possible for you to opt out of use of these cookies. <br>In addition, the coding language the Sites are written in uses session cookies and their use cannot be avoided. These are deleted each time you close your browser. These cookies do not store any information about the visitor once the browser is closed.</li> <li><strong>Performance cookies</strong> <br>Our performance cookies collect anonymous information about how you use the Sites and their features. For instance, our performance cookies collect information about which pages on the Sites are visited most often, which advertisements you view or interact with on the Sites or other websites on which our advertisements appear and if you receive any error messages.</li> <li><strong>Analytics cookies</strong> <br>The Sites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("<strong>Google</strong>"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help us analyse how users use the Sites. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Sites (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymisation, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent by us to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of us, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Sites, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to us. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. <br>The Sites may use other similar analytics cookies. These cookies are used to collect information about how visitors use the Sites. The information is collected anonymously, and used to report on the number of visitors to the Sites, where the visitors have come from, and the pages they have visited. <br>Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.
