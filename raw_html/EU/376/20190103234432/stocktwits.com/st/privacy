If you activate the mobile device options, when available, per the Terms of Use at <a href="https://www.stocktwits.com/st/terms">https://www.stocktwits.com/st/terms</a>, we will collect your cellular phone number. If you contact us by email through the Site, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and may use your email address, and any information that you provide to us in your message, to respond to you.</p>
<p><u>Use of Contact Information.</u> In addition, we may use your contact information to market to you, and provide you with information about, our products and services, including but not limited to our Service.

<p><u>Log Data.</u> When you visit the Site, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (&quot;Log Data&quot;). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Service, and for the Service’s technical administration. We do not associate your IP address with any other personally identifiable information to identify you personally, except in case of violation of the Terms of Use.</p>
<p><u>Do Not Track.</u> We do not respond to web browser &quot;do not track&quot; or other related mechanisms at this time.</p>
<h2 id="ii-cookies">II. Cookies</h2>
<p>Like many websites, we also use &quot;cookie&quot; technology to collect additional website usage data and to improve the Service. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. StockTwits may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with the Service, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the Service, to serve ads on the Service that are tailored to your interests, and to improve the Service. A session cookie enables certain features of the Site and our Service and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave the Site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.</p>
<h2 id="iii-information-sharing-and-disclosure">III. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
<p><u>Service Providers.</u> We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data. In addition, we may use information you provide about Third-Party Services to provide the Service, which may include accessing the Third-Party Services you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you. With respect to mobile applications or mobile versions of our Sites, we may collect the unique device identifier assigned to that device by phone makers, carriers, or makers of the operating system (the &quot;Device ID&quot;). Device IDs allow app developers, advertisers, and others to uniquely identify your device for purposes of storing application preferences and other data.</p>
<p>We may use your Device ID for security purposes. For example, if you have activated a feature that limits access to a Service from a specific device, our systems will access the Device ID from each device you attempt to access the Service with to determine if the device is the specific authorized device. Additionally, we may use Device IDs to monitor suspicious activity. For example, if we detect that a single account on a Site is being accessed from multiple devices, as determined by tracking the Device IDs that access an account, we may contact the user to ensure that such access has been authorized by the user.</p>
<p><u>Google Analytics.</u> We may also use web analytics services hosted by third parties, such as Google Analytics. </p>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users interact with the Service.  The information generated by the cookie about your use of the Website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to, and stored by, Google on their servers. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Service, compiling reports on website activity for us and providing other services relating to website activity and Internet usage.  Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.  You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of the Service.  By using the Service, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.</p>
<p><u>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement.</u> StockTwits cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of StockTwits or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.</p>
<p><u>Business Transfers.</u> StockTwits may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.</p>

<li>in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of our Sites&#39; users or the general public; or</li>
<li>as otherwise required by any applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may share your personal information with other third parties with your consent or instructions to do so.</p>

<p><u>Ad Serving.</u> We may serve ads on the Service. Such ads may be delivered to you by a web advertising vendor. In order to serve ads to you, we may use information collected during your searches or visits to our websites and information that we specifically acquire from third parties.</p>
<p><u>Advertising and Cookies.</u> Some of our third party advertising partners may distribute cookies to users in advertisements that are provided to us. StockTwits has no access to or control over these cookies once we have received the advertisements. Some of these advertisers and services we use to deliver advertising may be engaging in online behavioral advertising as defined by the Digital Advertising Alliance and FTC.</p>
<p><u>Affiliate Advertising.</u> We participate in affiliate advertising and allow affiliate links to be encoded on some of our pages. This means that we may earn a commission when you click on or make purchases via affiliate links and affiliate partners may use cookies to understand your use of the Services.</p>
<p>Although StockTwits does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising companies, if an advertiser asks StockTwits to show an advertisement to users with certain characteristics or a segment of that group (for example, men ages 21-30 who have viewed certain categories of content on the Service) and you respond to that advertisement, the third-party advertising company may conclude that you have the characteristics of the audience that they are trying to reach.</p>
<p><u>Opt-out.</u> As part of our commitment to transparency and your privacy, we provide the following links to opt-out of cookies provided by both our first party ad server and many third party advertising partners who may be engaging in online behavioral advertising:</p>
<p><u>First Party Opt-out.</u> Please visit this link to opt-out of cookies from our first party ad serving vendor, Google: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a>; Third Party and Online Behavioral Advertising Opt-out – Please visit this link to opt-out of cookies from over 50+ major third party behavioral advertising providers: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>
<p><u>Interest-Based Advertising Opt-out.</u> We or third parties may serve ads on the Service that are tailored to your interests and based on your activity online or in the applications on your mobile device. This type of ad tailoring — sometimes called &quot;interest-based&quot; or &quot;online behavioral&quot; advertising — is enabled through various technologies, including browser cookies, mobile advertising identifiers as well as other non-cookie technologies.  Information we collect subject to this Privacy Policy may be used for interest-based advertising, and may be shared with our service providers or partners for the purpose of serving such tailored ads.  In particular, we and our service providers and partners may use cookies and information you may provide during the registration process or otherwise enter when populating your profile, such as the type of investments that interest you.  To opt-out of interest-based advertising please visit <a href="">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</a>, where you may change your browser settings to no longer be shown ads that have been tailored to your interests.  </p>
