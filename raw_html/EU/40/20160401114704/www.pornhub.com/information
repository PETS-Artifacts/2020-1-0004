		<h2>DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement</h2><br \>
		<h2>Reporting Claims of Copyright Infringement</h2>
		<p>We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA") and/or any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating the user's access to www.pornhub.com (the "Pornhub").</p>
		<p>If you believe any material accessible on Pornhub infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, "Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement" for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner's behalf.</p>
		<p>If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, "Counter-Notification Procedures" for instructions on filing a counter notification). It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.</p>

		<h2>Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright Infringement</h2>
		<p>*The fastest and easiest way to notify Pornhub of alleged copyright infringement is via our form found at <a href="http://copyrightcomplianceagency.com/submit/index?id=pornhub.com">http://copyrightcomplianceagency.com/submit/index?id=pornhub.com</a>.</p>
		<p>This form is designed to help you identify your content accurately and help speed up the process of content take-down.*</p>
		<p>If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. Do not make false claims. Misuse of this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.</p>
		<p>We will also accept free-form copyright infringement notifications, submitted by email, fax and mail. In that case, in accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the "DMCA Notice") must include substantially the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.</li>
			<li>Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material. If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, typically is not adequate. Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).</li>
			<li>Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail address).</li>
			<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law.</li>
			<li>A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
			<li>Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our designated Copyright Agent to receive DMCA Notices is: </p>
		<ul class="noListStyle">
			<li>Legal Team at Copyright Compliance Agency</li>
			<li>Equity House</li>
			<li>84 Albert Street</li>
			<li>Belize City,</li>
			<li>Belize</li>
			<li>Phone: 0017024728855</li>
			<li>Facsimile: 0017024728855</li>
			<li>Email Pornhub.com<span>@</span>copyrightcomplianceagency.com</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you fail to comply with all of the requirements of Section 512(c)(3) of the DMCA, your DMCA Notice may not be effective.</p>
		<p>Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Pornhub is infringing your copyright, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.</p>
		<p>The copyright owner's name will be published on Pornhub in place of disabled content. This will become part of the public record of your DMCA Notice, along with your description of the work(s) allegedly infringed. All the information provided in a DMCA Notice and /or the actual DMCA Notice (including your personal information) may be forwarded to the uploader of the allegedly infringing content. By submitting a DMCA Notice, you consent to having your information revealed in this way.</p>
		<h2>Counter-Notification Procedures</h2>
		<p>If you have received a DMCA Notice and believe that material you posted on Pornhub was removed or access to it was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may file a counter-notification with us (a "Counter-Notice"). Counter notifications must be submitted by the video's original uploader or an agent authorized to act on their behalf.</p>
		<p>Counter-notices must be sent to our designated agent:</p>
		<ul class="noListStyle">
			<li>Legal Team at Copyright Compliance Agency</li>
			<li>Equity House</li>
			<li>84 Albert Street</li>
			<li>Belize City,</li>
			<li>Belize</li>
			<li>Phone: 0017024728855</li>
			<li>Facsimile: 0017024728855</li>
			<li>Email Pornhub.com<span>@</span>copyrightcomplianceagency.com</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Pursuant to the DMCA, the Counter-Notice must include substantially the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;</li>
			<li>Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;</li>
			<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and</li>
			<li>A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial district in which the operator of Pornhub may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such person.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will not respond to counter notifications that do not meet the requirements above.</p>
		<p>After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after 10 business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.</p>
		<p>Please note that when we forward your Counter Notice, it will include your personal information. By submitting a counter notification, you consent to having your information revealed in this way. We will not forward the counter notification to any party other than the original claimant or to law enforcement or parties that assist us with enforcing and protecting our rights.</p>
		<p>Please be aware that if you knowingly materially misrepresent that material or activity on Pornhub was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may be held liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) under Section 512(f) of the DMCA.</p>

		<h2>Repeat Infringers</h2>
		<p>In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating and/or disabling, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, the accounts of users who are deemed to be repeat infringers. We may also at our sole discretion limit access to Pornhub, terminate and/or disable the accounts of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>

	<p><strong>Acceptance of the Terms of Service</strong><br /><br />
	The following terms and conditions, together with any documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, these "<strong>Terms of Service</strong>"), govern your access to and use of <a href="http://www.pornhub.com">www.pornhub.com</a> ("Pornhub" or the "<strong>Website</strong>"), including any content, functionality and services offered on or through the Website, whether as a guest or a registered user. These Terms of Service apply to the Website, web pages, interactive features, applications, widgets, blogs, social networks, social network "tabs", or other online or wireless offerings that post a link to these Terms of Service, whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other technology, manner or means.

	</p>

	<p>Please read the Terms of Service carefully before you start to use the Website. By using the Website or by clicking to accept or agree to the Terms of Service when this option is made available to you, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy, found at <a href="http://www.pornhub.com/information#privacy">http://www.pornhub.com/information#privacy</a>, incorporated herein by reference. If you do not want to agree to these Terms of Service or the Privacy Policy, you must not access or use the Website.</p>

	<p>If you access or use the Website, whether you click to accept or not, you agree to all of the various terms in these Terms of Service. If you do not understand all of these Terms of Service, you should consult an attorney before agreeing to any of the Terms of Service.</p>

	<p>You consent to entering these Terms of Service electronically, and to storage of records related to these Terms of Service in electronic form. </p>

	<p>When using the Website, you shall be subject to any posted rules, community guidelines, or policies. Such rules, guidelines, and policies are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service. We may also offer other websites that are governed by different Terms of Service.</p>

	<br /><p><strong>Ability to Accept Terms of Service</strong><br /><br />
	You affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or the age of majority in the jurisdiction you are accessing the Website from, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service. If you are under 18 or the applicable age of majority, you are not permitted to submit personal information to us or use the Website. You also represent that the jurisdiction from which you access the Website does not prohibit the receiving or viewing of sexually explicit content.</p>


	<br /><p><strong>Changes to the Terms of Service</strong><br /><br />
		We may modify or revise these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion and you agree to be bound by such modifications or revisions. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to these Terms of Service, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at <a href="http://www.pornhub.com/information#terms">http://www.pornhub.com/information#terms</a>, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.  </p>


	<p>If we change anything in these Terms of Service, the change will be reflected in the "last modified date". You agree that you will periodically review these terms and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision of these terms. If the "last modified" date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed these terms, then they are unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review the terms, and you agree to the new ones.</p>

	<p>All changes are effective immediately when we post them, and apply to all access to and use of the Website thereafter. The updated version supersedes any prior versions immediately upon being posted, and the prior version(s) shall have no continuing legal effect. If you do not review new terms as posted, then you agree that you have waived your right to do so, and you are therefore bound by the updated conditions, even if you failed to review the new ones. You are on notice of changes, and your failure to review the amended terms is your own omission. By continuing to use the Website subsequent to us making available an amended version of these Terms of Service, you thereby acknowledge, agree to and consent to such amendment.</p>

								Our system automatically features videos with good ratings, above average views, favorites, comments as well as video quality among many other factors. It is always beneficial to build up your community presence and subscribers so when you release a new video it has a higher chance to get featured. If a video is not featured right away it may still become featured several weeks, months or even years later. Don't wait for videos to be featured to upload another one. You are not penalized by having many videos waiting to be featured. Videos can still make hundreds of dollars without being featured by appearing in searches, category listings, playlists etc.								<div class="feedBack clearfix">

								In addition to the millions of videos already on Pornhub, you get access to 100K + Premium videos, with more being added to the video library every day. A lot of this content is organized into DVDs. This is all full length and high quality. It doesn't mean everything is 720p+ because some of it is older content but the majority is 720p+. The top shelf stuff comes from content partners. like Brazzers, Mofos, Digital Playground, Backroom Casting Couch, Girls do Porn, Net Video Girls, Kink.com and lots more.								<div class="feedBack clearfix">

								No ads. So nothing distracts you while you’re trying to enjoy the main event. No popups, no side ads, nada. Better quality. Any video that is available to stream in 1080p will have that option and we are also encoding our 720p at higher bitrates. Faster Streaming. We are already pretty damn fast on Pornhub but Premium means lightning speed, flawless playback. DVDs. Pick from a huge selection 30K+ of full-length titles. Badges. For those that appreciate the quirks of our community achievements, Premium unlocks all new levels.								<div class="feedBack clearfix">
