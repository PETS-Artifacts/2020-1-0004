                            <p>We process your personal information for the purposes set out in this privacy notice.  We have also set out some legal reasons why we may process your personal information (these depend on what category of personal information we are processing). We normally process standard personal information if this is necessary to provide the services set out in a contract, it is in our or a third party&rsquo;s legitimate interests or it is required or allowed by any law that applies. Please see below for more information about this and the reasons why we may need to process special category information.</p>
<p>By law, we must have a lawful reason for processing your personal information. We process standard personal information about you if this is:</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li><strong>necessary to provide the services set out in a contract</strong> &minus; if we have a contract with you, we will process your personal information in order to fulfil that contract (that is, to provide you and your dependants with our products and services);</li>
    <li><strong>in our or a third party&rsquo;s legitimate interests</strong> &minus; details of those legitimate interests are set out in more detail<strong><a href="#legitimateinterest"> below</a></strong>; </li>
    <li><strong>required or allowed by law</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>We process special category information about you because:</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li><strong>it is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine</strong>, to assess whether you are able to work, medical diagnosis, to provide health or social care or treatment, or to manage health-care or social-care systems (including to monitor whether we are meeting expectations relating to our clinical and non-clinical performance);</li>
    <li><strong>it is necessary for an insurance purpose</strong> (for example, advising on, arranging, providing or managing an insurance contract, dealing with a claim made under an insurance contract, or relating to rights and responsibilities arising in connection with an insurance contract or law);</li>
    <li><strong>it is necessary to establish, make or defend legal claims</strong> (for example, claims against us for insurance);</li>
    <li><strong>it is necessary for the purposes of preventing or detecting an unlawful act</strong> in circumstances where we must carry out checks without your permission so as not to affect the outcome of those checks (for example, anti-fraud and anti-money-laundering checks or to check other unlawful behaviour, or carry out investigations with other insurers and third parties for the purpose of detecting fraud);</li>
    <li><strong>it is necessary for a purpose designed to protect the public against dishonesty, malpractice or other seriously improper behaviour</strong> (for example, investigations in response to a safeguarding concern, a member's complaint or a regulator (such as the Care Quality Commission or the General Medical Council) telling us about an issue);</li>
    <li><strong>it is in the public interest, in line with any laws that apply</strong>;</li>
    <li><strong>it is information that you have made public; or</strong></li>
    <li><strong>we have your permission</strong>. As is best practice, we will only ask you for permission to process your personal information if there is no other legal reason to process it. If we need to ask for your permission, we will make it clear that this is what we are asking for, and ask you to confirm your choice to give us that permission. If we cannot provide a product or service without your permission (for example, we can&rsquo;t manage and run a health trust without health information), we will make this clear when we ask for your permission. If you later withdraw your permission, we will no longer be able to provide you with a product or service that relies on having your permission.</li>

More detailed information about our legitimate interests is set out below.</p>
<p>Legitimate interest is one of the legal reasons why we may process your personal information. Taking into account your interests, rights and freedoms, legitimate interests which allow us to process your personal information include:</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li>to manage our relationship with you, our business and third parties who provide products or services for us (for example, to check that you have received a service that you&rsquo;re covered for, to validate invoices and so on);</li>
    <li>to provide health-care services on behalf of a third party (for example, your employer);</li>
    <li>to make sure that claims are handled efficiently and to investigate complaints (for example, we may ask your treatment provider for information to make sure we receive accurate information and to monitor the quality of your treatment and care);</li>
    <li>to keep our records up to date and to provide you with marketing as allowed by law;</li>
    <li>to develop and carry out marketing activities and to show you information that is of interest to you, based on our understanding of your preferences (we combine information you give us with information we receive about you from third parties to help us understand you better);</li>
    <li>for statistical research and analysis so that we can monitor and improve products, services, websites and apps, or develop new ones;</li>
    <li>to contact you about market research we are carrying out;</li>
    <li>to monitor how well we are meeting our clinical and non-clinical performance expectations in the case of health-care providers;</li>
    <li>to enforce or apply our website terms of use, our policy terms and conditions or other contracts, or to protect our (or our customers&rsquo; or other people&rsquo;s) rights, property or safety;</li>
    <li>to exercise our rights, to defend ourselves from claims and to keep to laws and regulations that apply to us and the third parties we work with; and</li>
    <li>to take part in, or be the subject of, any sale, purchase, merger or takeover of all or part of the Bupa business.

                            <p>Like many businesses, we sometimes use automation to provide you with a quicker, better, more consistent and fair service, and marketing information we think will be of interest to you (including discounts on our products and services). This will involve evaluating information about you and, in some cases, using technology to provide you with automatic responses or decisions (automated decisions). You can click below for more information about this.</p>
<p>You have the <a href="#yourights">right</a> to object to direct marketing and profiling relating to direct marketing. You may also have the right to object to other types of profiling and automated decision-making set out below. In these cases, you have the right to ask us to make sure that one of our advisers reviews an automated decision, to let us know how you feel about it and to ask us to reconsider the decision. You can <a href="mailto:dataprotection@bupa.com">contact us</a> to exercise these rights.</p>
<p>By law, we must tell you about:</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li>automated decision-making (making a decision using technology, without any person being involved); and</li>
    <li>profiling (automated processing of your information to help us evaluate certain things about you, for example, your personal preferences and your interests).</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>This is because you have certain rights relating to both automated decision-making and profiling. You have the right to object to profiling relating to direct marketing. If you do this, we will no longer carry out profiling for direct marketing purposes.  You also have the right to object to profiling in other circumstances set out below.</p>
<p>When we make decisions using only automated processing which produce legal effects which concern you or which have a significant effect on you, we will let you know. You then have 21 days to ask us to reconsider our decision or to make a new decision that is not based only on automated processing. If we receive a request from you, within 21 days of receiving your request, we will:</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li>consider the request, including any information you have provided that is relevant to it;</li>
    <li>meet your request; and</li>
    <li>let you know in writing what we have done to meet your request, and the outcome.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p>You can <a href="mailto:dataprotection@bupa.com">contact us </a>to ask about these <a href="#yourights">rights</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Profiling and automated decision-making</strong></p>
<p>The processes set out below involve both profiling and automated decision-making.</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li>Depending on the type of health-insurance product that you want to benefit from, to help us decide what level of cover we can offer you, we will ask you to provide information about your medical history. We may use software to review this information to find out whether you have any previous or existing health conditions which we cannot cover you for and which will be excluded from your policy.</li>
    <li>We may use software to help us calculate the price of products and services based on what we know about you and other customers. For example, our technology may analyse information about your claims history and compare it with the information we hold about previous claims to evaluate how likely you are to need to make a claim. We may also evaluate your age, where you live and other details relating to your health (such as existing health conditions and whether you smoke) to calculate prices for community-rated products which are based on predefined groups with similar risk profiles.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<p><strong>Profiling</strong></p>
<p>The processes set out below involve profiling.</p>
<ul class="small-dot-rte">
    <li>In order to improve outcomes and be more efficient, and allow us to offer advice about different treatment paths (for example, alternatives to surgery or other invasive treatments), we may use software to evaluate medical history and information about the general population in an area to identify customers who are likely to need that advice most.</li>
    <li>When your policy is due for renewal, our software tells us this and may also evaluate your payment and claims history, information about the general information in a particular area, and other information from third parties to automatically provide you with information about what incentives we can offer you and the marketing messages you will receive.</li>
    <li>We ask other organisations to carry out some of our consumer and market analysis to improve our marketing processes.  This involves sharing personal information relating to our customers with third parties who specialise in profiling and segmenting people (putting people into groups of different types of customer, based on different kinds of information collected about them, to help us to better target our products to them).  These companies match the information we give them with information they get from other sources to improve the accuracy of their analysis. We use the results of this analysis to help us target marketing and offers.</li>
    <li>We may use information about the products you have bought, and information about what other customers who have bought the same products you have bought, to make sure we send you information about the products you are most likely to be interested in.</li>
    <li>We may share your personal information (including your name, date of birth, sex and the country you live in) with third-party companies, such as FINSCAN, who we use to carry out anti-fraud checks. We will review any matches from this process. (We will not use automated  decision-making for this.)</li>

                            A cookie, also known as a browser cookie, is a text file containing small amounts of information which a server may download to your computer hard drive, tablet or mobile device when you visit a website or use an app.<br />
<br />
There are different types of cookies which are used to do different things. These include letting you navigate between different pages on a website efficiently, remembering preferences you have given and helping us to identify ways to improve your overall site experience. Others are used to provide you with advertising which is more tailored to your interests, or to measure the number of site visits and the most popular pages users visit.

                            Cookies can be set and controlled by the operator of the website which the user is browsing such as Bupa for this website (known as a &lsquo;first party cookie&rsquo;) or a third party such as Facebook, for example to display advertisements and social sharing features, (known as a &lsquo;third party cookie&rsquo;).<br />
<br />
Due to their core role of enhancing and enabling usability or site processes, disabling certain cookies may prevent you from using certain aspects of the Bupa website, such as generating a quote or placing an order.<br />
<br />
Broadly speaking, there are two different types of browser cookie:<br />
<br />
(1) <b>Session cookies</b> are stored in the computer's memory during a user's browsing session and are automatically deleted from the user's computer when the browser is closed or the session is deemed to have ended.<br />
<br />
These cookies usually store a session ID that is not personally identifiable to users, allowing the user to move from page to page without having to log-in repeatedly. They are widely used by commercial websites; for example to keep track of items that a consumer has added to a shopping basket.<br />
<br />
Session cookies do not collect any information from the user's computer and they expire at the end of the user's browser session. They can also become inaccessible after the session has been inactive for a specified length of time, usually 20 or 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
(2) <b>Persistent cookies</b> are stored on the user's computer and are not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies can be used to retain user preferences for a particular website, allowing those preferences to be used in future browsing sessions.<br />
<br />
Persistent cookies usually assign a unique ID to the user&rsquo;s browser and they are usually configured to identify a user for a prolonged period of time, from days to months or even years.
