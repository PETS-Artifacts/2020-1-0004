                At Lifewire, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. In this policy we describe our privacy practices
                with regard to information we collect through Lifewire.com and affiliated sites (the “Site”), to help you make informed decisions about how you share
                information when you visit or use the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on Lifewire:</h3>
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                We may collect information, including personally identifiable information, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you
                may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our
                newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also may choose to provide personally identifiable information about yourself when you participate in forums or discussions on the Site. Please be
                aware that information you post in these forums may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive or personal information that you would not want to be available to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                <h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit Lifewire</h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners and vendors may automatically collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web
                beacons, and other similar technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of
                your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique
                device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site), and other details that generally are not
                considered personally identifiable.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Cookies</b>
                are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies (such
                as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit
                <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. See the section below regarding <a href="#your-choices">Your choices</a> to learn more
                about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use
                cookies to enhance their functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
                To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you.
                <b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of
                purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are
                actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors
                to the Site. <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html">Click here to learn more about Google Analytics and how you may opt out.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b>
                Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is no
                consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” in this context. Like many other websites, Lifewire.com is not configured to
                respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">Click here to learn more about "do not track" signals.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like” buttons)
                also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy
                policies or notices of those providers.
            </p>
            <p>

                content. Advertisers are responsible for ensuring all Ads and related claims are adequately substantiated. Further, Advertisers must adhere to Lifewire’s Prohibited Content Guidelines and Additional Standards set forth below, which are incorporated into and made a part of these Guidelines.

                the right to remove, without notice, any Ads that do not meet these Guidelines, regardless of whether the Ad was previously accepted by Lifewire.
