P.O. Box 980789, Ypsilanti, MI 48198.</p>
<p><strong>Online Tracking Information</strong></p>

browser-based “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) signals other than cookies,
BattleMetrics, LLC does not currently respond to “DNT” signals to its US
websites.</p>
<p>Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies; however, this may
prevent you from having access to some functions or services on our
sites.</p>
<p>See Sections 5 and 7 for more information.</p>
<h3 id="3-personally-identifiable-information-we-collect-from-you">3. Personally Identifiable Information We Collect From You</h3>
<p>When you visit this site we will not collect any personally identifiable
information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. For
purposes of this Privacy Statement, “personally identifiable
information” is information that identifies you as an individual, for
example your name, street address, telephone number, e-mail address and
credit card number. If you opt not to provide us with personally
identifiable information you can still access our website, however you
will be unable to create login credentials which are necessary to access
certain functionalities on the site. Furthermore, you may not be able to
activate or use a service, have a purchase order fulfilled, or receive
product information.</p>
<p><strong>BattleMetrics.com - Saving Content</strong></p>
<p>Some functionality and services we provide you offer the opportunity to
save certain content. The information can only be saved by
creating login credentials described in the next paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>BattleMetrics.com - Creating Login Credentials</strong></p>
<p>Certain pages of this website may allow you to create login credentials
by typing in your user name/ID or email address and password and other
information, or by using one of the available social media
authentication methods such as logging in through the Steam network. If
you choose to create login credentials using your account with one of
the available social media authentication tools, you allow us to access
your information that is publicly available or that you have made
publicly available (e.g., name, user ID, profile picture), and
information you “Allow” the website to access. By authenticating through
one of the social media options, you allow us to receive your
information that is accessible. We encourage you to review the privacy
policy and any terms and conditions, for the method you choose to
utilize for authentication.</p>
<h3 id="4-how-we-use-the-personally-identifiable-information-we-collect">4. How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be used
to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fulfill a site user request (e.g., create log in credentials,
brochure fulfillment, send marketing or promotional materials
including e-mails, price quotes, send alerts, send updates, and/or
to save or share content)</li>
<li>Fulfill and deliver an order for goods or services</li>
<li>Respond to your comments or requests for information</li>
<li>Meet a request for or to develop new products or services</li>
<li>Make the user experience more customer friendly</li>
<li>Contact you if necessary in the course of processing or shipping an
order for products or services</li>
<li>Generate site analytics that improve our site layout, content,
product offerings and services</li>

<li>Match personal data collected here with data about you that we
collect through other sources</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="5-other-information-we-collect-from-site-visitors">5. Other  Information We Collect From Site Visitors</h3>
<p>This site collects other information from site visitors. This means
that we do not track these items on an individual basis that identifies
the site visitor, but rather gather and collect this information on an
aggregate [or anonymous] basis that includes all site visitors.
Non-personally identifiable information may include information such
as tracking the site pages that are visited, the amount of time spent on
our site, clicks, mouse movements, scrolls, page views, events (which
shopping tools you interacted with), and zip code. This includes aggregate
data provided by a third-party that surveys site visitors on our behalf.</p>
<p>Information that we collect from RCON users is for the sole use of the RCON
user and those who the RCON user authorizes to view such information. However,
we will use some of the information we obtain over the RCON connection to
create more accurate player and server data for the public. In no event will
we disclose information obtained over the RCON connection to unauthorized
users unless that information is already publicly available. For example,
player names are always public, whereas IPs are not. In that situation
we would only display the player name to the public and not the IP.</p>
<p>We may use session and persistent “cookies,” session logs, spot light
ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags, banner ads or links, third-party
networks that serve user-requested emails (e.g., a third party email
service provider for Tell-a-Friend user-customized emails), and
third-party click tracking analytics tools (such as Adobe, DoubleClick,
Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and ClickTale; these
companies may also use such tools) to collect aggregate or other
non-personally identifiable information about site visitors. An
explanation on collection methods and how they work is included in
Section 7 - Methods to Collect Information, below.</p>
<p>We also use your data for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies who serve ads to help keep 
content free. For these partners, we put additional restrictions on 
how your data can be used to prevent it from misuse. For instance, 
we do not allow these partners to take your information for profiling 
and personalizing ads on other sites.</p>
<p>Please review the following for a full list of partners and purposes:

<h3 id="6-how-we-use-the-aggregate-or-non-personally-identifiable-information-we-collect">6. How We Use the Aggregate or Non-Personally Identifiable Information We Collect</h3>
<p>Non-Personally identifiable information collected on this site may be
used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compile aggregate and statistical data to help in website design and
to identify popular features</li>
<li>Measure site activity to allow us to update our site to better meet
user wants and needs</li>
<li>Make the user experience more customer friendly</li>
</ul>
<p>This site utilizes non-personally identifiable information for the
purpose of performing analytics on the users&#39; experience while visiting
this site. This analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is performed on an aggregate level and does not identify you or your
information personally</li>
<li>May involve the use of a third-party vendor acting on behalf of this
site</li>
<li>Is performed in order to improve our website and the user experience</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="7-methods-to-collect-information-and-interest-based-online-behavioral-advertising">7. Methods to Collect Information and Interest-Based/Online Behavioral Advertising</h3>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your
visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example,
cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of
our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to
better match your interests and preferences. There are a couple
different types of cookies.</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer&#39;s working memory
(RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your
browser&#39;s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session
cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>A “persistent” cookie is stored on your computer&#39;s hard drive until a
specified date, which could be tomorrow, next week, or 10 years from
now. Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they
expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually
remove them. Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies,
however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions
or features.</p>
<p>This site may use a third party to activate and/or deliver a service, or
deliver site functionality such as fulfilling your request to purchase a
product or service, including items from our online store. In performing
this function the third party may place a persistent cookie on your
computer or have to gather personal information from you in order to
activate and deliver the service, or facilitate the processing of your
purchase.</p>
<p>This site may use a third-party click tracking analytics tool (such as
Adobe, DoubleClick, Efficient Frontier, Keynote, Google Analytics and
ClickTale) to capture clickthrough statistics.</p>
<p>This site may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are
site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance,
whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. Emails
or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web
beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s
experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were
printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which
they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the
applicable IP address. In general, any electronic image viewed as part
of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon.</p>
<p>This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site. We
use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our
site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information
most frequently visited is easier to find. By tracking page visits, we
can also determine if the information we&#39;re providing is being used. The
only data gathered is the Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you
came (which contains no personal information), the website that referred
you, the pages you visited and the date and time of those visits.</p>
<p>Users may be provided the opportunity to integrate with third-party
social media sites, and this site may track on an aggregate level the
number of items “liked” on this site, or items on this site that you
choose to share with a third-party social media site.</p>
<p>Users may be directed to this site via banner ads, site links or QR
Codes. Ads, site links or QR Codes may use tools such as cookies or web
beacons to deliver metrics on the effectiveness of the ads or links.
They do not collect personally identifiable information from the user.</p>
<p>This website also utilizes Google Analytics and its associated cookies.
If you wish to opt-out of the tracking associated with Google Analytics,
you can download <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">this</a> addon.
Additionally, you may opt-out by adjusting your Ads Settings, Ad Settings for
mobile apps, or any other available means (such as the NAI consumer opt-out).</p>
