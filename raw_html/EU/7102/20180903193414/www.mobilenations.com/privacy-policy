<p>This privacy statement ("Privacy Statement") is designed to provide information about Mobile Nations’ (“Mobile Nation”, “we”, “our” or “us”) privacy and data collection practices for the Mobile Nations network of websites and mobile applications, including but not limited to MobileNations.com, AndroidCentral.com, iMore.com, WindowsCentral.com, CrackBerry.com, TeslaCentral.com, ModMy.com, Connectedly.com, Thrifter.com, WebOSnation.com, VisorCentral.com, NokiaExperts.com, and TreoCentral.com (each a “Site” and collectively, the “Sites”). This Privacy Statement does not cover any information collected at any other websites, or services (unless specifically stated on the website or service). </p>
<p>Please review this Privacy Statement carefully. If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Statement, contact Mobile Nations' privacy coordinator by sending an email to <a href="mailto:info@mobilenations.com">info@mobilenations.com</a>. In addition, please review the Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions (<a href="http://www.mobilenations.com/terms-conditions">http://www.mobilenations.com/terms-conditions</a>) which governs your use of the Sites. By accessing the Sites, you consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information and data, and other activities, as described below. </p>
<h2 id="active-collection-of-personal-information">Active Collection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>In order that you may access or take advantage of the Sites, we may ask you to provide Personal Information when you register with the Sites and when you communicate or otherwise interact with the Sites. "Personal Information" is information that can be used to identify a specific individual. Examples of Personal Information we may collect through the Sites include, without limitation: name, gender, birthday, current city, phone number, payment card information, email address, social media profile picture, physical or geographic location data, and information about your use of the Sites, such as the content in your forum posts. You may elect not to submit Personal Information; however, as a result, you may not be able to use some of the Sites' features or functionality.</p>
<h2 id="passive-collection-of-information-online-tracking-by-third-parties">Passive Collection of Information; Online Tracking by Third Parties</h2>
<p>In addition to the Personal Information that you actively provide to us, we and our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect certain information about your use of the Sites. This information may include demographic and geographic information; IP address; internet service provider, computer (or mobile device) operating system and mobile device identifiers, browser type; and operating system characteristics as well as clickstream data, which is information about the page-by-page paths you take as you browse through our website. This information may be used, among other things, to help us compile website metrics and analytics, and thereby improve and customize your experiences on the Sites, to target advertisements for products and services in which you might be interested based on your visits to the Sites, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, or to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. We may share information about visitors to the Sites with third party companies for the same purposes. </p>
<p>The methods that we and our service providers and other third parties may use to automatically collect such information may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Browser Cookies:</strong> Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a website. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Sites.</li>

<li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Sites and to monitor how users navigate the Sites.</li>
<li><strong>Embedded Scripts:</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.</li>
<li><strong>Location-identifying Technologies:</strong> We may use GPS (global positioning systems) software and other location-based technologies such as iBeacons (as defined below) to locate you so we may verify your location and deliver relevant content to you based on your location. In addition to traditional GPS location-based services, some of the service providers and others with whom we work may install low power Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, radio transmitters, or other devices in physical locations, which emit a signal that the can be detected to pinpoint your location (“iBeacons”).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may send you product promotions that we think you may be interested in receiving based on passively-collected information. Passively-collected information about you, such as how you interact with the Sites, may be combined with your Personal Information, in which case we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Statement.

<li><strong>Legal and Safety Obligations:</strong> To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may also transfer and disclose user information, including Personal Information: (i) in the event we are required to respond to subpoenas or other legal process or if in our good faith opinion such disclosure is required or permitted by law; (ii) at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation; (iii) to protect and/or defend Mobile Nations or enforce other policies applicable to the Sites; or (iv) to protect the personal safety, life, health, rights, property or security of any individual.

<h2 id="community-features-and-user-content">Community Features and User Content</h2>
<p>The Sites may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly through chat rooms, forums, interactive features, or other communication functionality (“Community Features”). We may provide functionality for you to submit or post text (including questions, comments, and suggestions), photographs, audio, videos, or other content (collectively, "User Content") through Community Features, by linking Sites to a third party service, or otherwise. Please note that certain information, such as your username and profile picture, may be publicly displayed on the Sites along with your User Content. User Content consisting of uploaded files may contain metadata, which may contain Personal Information or other information about or relating to you. You may wish to remove metadata from your file(s) before transmitting such file(s) to the Service.</p>
<p>Note that anything you post through Community Features is public -- others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information, that information will be considered public information. If you submit User Content, it may be published online or offline at any time. In addition, we may use your User Content and any excerpt from your User Content in connection with our advertising, marketing, publicity and promotional activities.</p>
<h2 id="social-features">Social Features</h2>

Also, both Mobile Nations and the third party may have access to certain information about you and your use of the Sites and the third party site or service. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party website give us access to their profiles and you are one of their “connections,” or information about you is otherwise accessible through your “connections’” web pages, profile pages, or similar pages on a social networking or other third party website or interactive service.</p>
<p>The information we collect in connection with Social Features is subject to this Privacy Statement. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party’s privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party website or service.</p>
<h2 id="complaints-inquiries-and-requests-for-disclosure">Complaints, inquiries, and requests for disclosure</h2>
