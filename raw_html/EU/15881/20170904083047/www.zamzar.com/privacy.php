        <p><span class='smallHeader'>Third Party Advertising</span><br/>
        We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not
        including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide
        advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.  
        To learn more about behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this use of your anonymous information, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org">networkadvertising.org</a>.
        </p>

        <p><span class='smallHeader'>User Files</span><br/>
        Your files and the content of those files belong to you, so it is important to know that as part of our commitment to privacy we will not
        share, sell or pass on your files to any third parties. The only time any of our team members will handle your files is in the event of a support
        enquiry, or if a conversion fails and requires further investigation or in the circumstances outlined above in the "Certain Exceptional Disclosures"
        section.
        </p>

        <p><span class='smallHeader'>Storage of User Files</span><br/>
        When users upload files to be converted Zamzar stores those files on its servers until such time as those files have been converted to
        the new file format. As soon as this has been done Zamzar removes the original user files from its servers. The converted files remain
        in place on the servers for users to download, until such time as they expire (currently 24 hours for the free version of the service),
        at which point they are deleted, or in the case of a subscribed user until such time as that user deletes those files. Files stored for
        download are only accessible by Zamzar and through the clickable link generated for download.
        </p>

        <p><span class='smallHeader'>Transfer and sharing of data</span><br/>
        In the course of providing the Services data is transferred to and from servers located in the United States. By agreeing to Zamzar's 
	Terms of Service you accept the transfer of such data as is necessary to provide the Services. In the case of those customers paying for 
	Services those customers also agree to the transfer of such data as is necessary to process payment with third party payment providers 
	such as PayPal.  PayPal has access to the personal data they require to perform their functions but may not use personal data for any 
	other purposes and they must process personal data in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.  PayPal offers a secure environment 
	for online card payments.  In addition, your card details may be shared with any third parties as is necessary to process your 
	transaction, for example, financial institutions necessary to authorise and clear your card payment.
