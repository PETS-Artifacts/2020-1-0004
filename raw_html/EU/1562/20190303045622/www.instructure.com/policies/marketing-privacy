<p><strong>DATA COLLECTION.</strong></p>

<p><strong>DATA YOU PROVIDE TO US</strong>. We collect information from you, such as first and last name, gender, e-mail and mailing addresses, phone number, professional title, company name, educational institution or organization name, and password when you provide such information to our Site or to an Instructure employee, or otherwise provide this information to Instructure, such as via email. When you participate in one of our surveys, we may collect additional profile information, such as information indicating your interest in specific Instructure services. We collect information about you when you apply for positions within Instructure. We also collect other types of personal data and demographic information that you provide to us voluntarily. This includes information provided to Instructure employees in the course of routine interactions with them or provided in response to an email from Instructure.</p>

<p><strong>DATA COLLECTED VIA TECHNOLOGY</strong>. To make our Site more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address, domain name, geographic location, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. We also use web beacons and cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and which you viewed.</p>

<p><strong>WEB BEACONS</strong> are digital images we use to log information on our Site and in our emails. We use web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.</p>

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong> are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p>

<p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies:</p>
