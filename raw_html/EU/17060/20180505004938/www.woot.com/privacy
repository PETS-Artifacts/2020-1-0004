        <b>Automatic Information:</b> We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example,
        like many Web sites, we use &quot;cookies,&quot; and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses

        other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail

      <ul>
        <li>Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to
        provide features such as personalized advertisements on other Web sites and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between
        visits.</li>
        <li>The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the

        delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on&#39;s settings or visiting the

          <h3>Does Woot Share the Information It Receives?</h3>
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to
      others. We share customer information only as described below and with our parent corporation, Amazon.com, Inc., and the
      subsidiaries it controls that either are subject to this Privacy Notice or follow practices at least as protective as those
      described in this Privacy Notice.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:</b> We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, these businesses
        might sell offerings to you directly through Woot.com, such as the wineries who sell on Wine.Woot. In other cases, we might
        sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we
        share customer information related to those transactions with that third party.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Third-Party Service Providers:</b> We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing  payments, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Promotional Offers:</b> Sometimes we send offers to selected groups of our customers on behalf of other businesses. When
        we do this, we do not give that business your name and address. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust
        your 
        <a href="https://account.woot.com/subscriptions">Email Preferences</a>.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Business Transfers:</b> As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business
        units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject
        to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the
        unlikely event that Woot, Inc., or substantially all of its assets, are acquired, customer information will of course be
        one of the transferred assets.</li>
        <li>
        <b>Protection of Woot and Others:</b> We release account and other personal information when we believe release is
        appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the
        rights, property, or safety of Woot, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and
        organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting,
        sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of
        the commitments set forth in this Privacy Notice.</li>
        <li>
        <b>With Your Consent:</b> Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third
        parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</li>

        <li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software,
        which encrypts information you input.</li>
        <li>We reveal only the last four digits of your payment instrument numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire payment instrument number to the appropriate payment company during order processing.</li>
        <li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign

        <h1>Interest-Based Ads</h1>
      </a>
      <p>We use Amazon and third-party ad serving companies to display interest-based advertising using information you make
      available to us when you interact with our websites, content or services. Interest-based ads, also sometimes referred to as
      personalized or targeted ads, are displayed to you based on information from activities such as purchasing on our websites,
      visiting sites that contain our content or ads, or interacting with our websites and services.
      <a href="#gather">Click here</a> for more information about the types of information that we gather. In providing
      interest-based ads, Amazon follows the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising developed by the Digital
      Advertising Alliance (a coalition of marketing, online advertising, and consumer advocacy organizations).</p>
      <p>We use cookies, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies (collectively,
      &quot;cookies&quot;). Cookies enable ad networks and advertisers to learn about what ads you see, what ads you click, and
      other actions you take on our websites and other sites. This allows ad serving companies to provide you with more useful and
      relevant ads. For example, if they know what ads you have been previously shown they can be careful not to show you those
      same ads repeatedly.</p>
      <p>We do not provide any personal information to advertisers or to the third-party sites that display our interest-based ads.
      However, advertisers and other third parties (including the ad networks, ad-serving companies, and other service providers
      they may use) may assume that users who interact with or click on a personalized ad or content are part of the group that the
      ad or content is directed towards. Also, some third parties may provide us and Amazon information about you (such as the
      sites where you have been shown ads or demographic information) from offline and online sources that may be used to provide
      you more relevant and useful advertising.</p>
      <p>Advertisers or ad companies working on their behalf sometimes use technology to serve the ads that may appear on our
      websites directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies to
      measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize ad content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or
      other features that advertisers and third party sites may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third
      party websites are not covered by our Privacy Notice or this Interest-Based Ads Policy. Please contact them directly for more
      information about their privacy practices.</p>
      <a name="access"></a>
      <p>
        <b>Advertising Preferences</b>
      </p>
      <p>We offer you choices about receiving interest-based ads from Amazon. You can choose not to receive interest-based ads from
      Amazon by adjusting your
      <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dra/info">Advertising Preferences</a>. If you choose to opt out of receiving interest-based
      ads from Amazon, you will still see ads but they will not be personalized.</p>
      <p>In addition to the interest-based ads from Amazon, we may also use other third parties to serve interest-based ads. You
      can opt-out of receiving interest-based ads from third parties who are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) or
      who follow the Digital Advertising Alliance&#39;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising by visiting
