<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
<p>Like most website operators, Print Friendly & PDF collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Print Friendly & PDF's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Print Friendly & PDF's visitors use its services.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
