Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Cookies themselves record those areas of the site that have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Most websites use cookies because cookies allow the website publisher to ascertain whether the computer has visited the site before. In addition to browsing history, cookies may store the geographic location of a computer and the preferences associated with that computer on Experts Exchange.</p>

The last of these, of course, means that certain personalized services cannot then be provided to that user. You can, should you choose, disable the cookies from your browser and delete all cookies currently stored on your computer. This may, however, prevent you from taking advantage of services that Experts Exchange has to offer.</p>

                    <p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the services you have requested. If your membership with Experts Exchange lapses, we will maintain your information for a reasonable period of time after it lapses to permit you re-establish your membership and maintain any benefits you accrued while your prior membership was in effect. In some circumstances it may be necessary to retain your personal information to deal with any disputes. Accordingly, Experts Exchange may store messaging transcript data (including message content, member names, times and dates) arising from the use of Experts Exchange Community services for a period necessary to fulfill such purpose. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely. In accordance with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, European Union individuals who wish to delete their personal information may contact Experts Exchange, LLC via the contact information listed in Section 14 of this Privacy Policy. Your contribution to information exchanges on Experts Exchange, may be maintained indefinitely by Experts Exchange in order to serve the site's intended purpose.</p>
                    
                    <p>Your personal data will be stored on our backup system, which is kept in case of loss of data. It may be that where data is lost, the personal data held on you as part of our backup system is used to restore your account to its status before the loss of data. All personal data (including communication data) stored on the backup system shall be held in a secure manner in compliance with applicable law. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this policy.</p>
