<strong>Introduction</strong><br />

identifying information from it, or have combined it with other people&#39;s data in a way that it is no longer
associated with you. Similarly, when we receive data about you from our partners or customers, we keep the data and
subsequently combine it with other people&#39;s data in a way that it is no longer associated with you. Queries,
replies and comments you post on the Resource and related data may be exposed to public search engines and publicly
available search results, or other research services, for purposes of inviting broader engagement within the
business community.
</p>

<p>
Except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose personal information to any third party.
</p>
<p>
We may share your personal information with:<br />
<br />
(i) our subsidiaries to help detect and prevent potentially illegal actions and provide joint services to requesting
users;<br />
<br />
(ii) service providers, consultants or similar contractors or agents to support or enhance the Resource or our
business operations, or with whom we contract in order to carry out transactions initiated by you, such as credit
card processing organizations, and companies providing services available on the Resource (including authentication
and/or spell check services);<br />
<br />
(iii) other third parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information (or about whom you are otherwise
explicitly notified and solicited consent when using a specific service);<br />

</p>
<p>
Following termination or deactivation of your User account, We may retain your profile information (not personalized)
and User Content for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, or audit purposes. Furthermore, Allbiz may
retain and continue to use indefinitely all information (including User Content) contained in your communications to
other Users or posted to public or semi-public areas of the Service after termination or deactivation of your User
account.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Your Use of the Resource</strong><br />
<br />
Your name will necessarily be displayed throughout the Resource and to the public in order to offer the services of
the Resource. You can change or delete your Information in your personal account &ldquo;My All.biz&rdquo; at any
time.
</p>
<p><a name="cookies"></a><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>
<p>
The Resource may utilize &quot;cookies&quot;, which are small text files placed on your computer or device. We also
use pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies. Such devices are used to help analyze our web page flow,
customize our services, optimize our user interfaces, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and
safety. With these devices, we collect data such as the identity of the applicable internet service provider, the
user&#39;s IP address of his or her terminal device, the type of browser software and operating system in use, the
date and time of Resource access, the website address, if any, from which the user linked to the Resource, and other
similar traffic-related information. We may also aggregate such information with similar data collected from other
users and disclose such aggregate information to third parties. Certain features are only available through the use
of cookies, and generally we need to use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. You are
always free to decline Resource cookies via your browser settings, although, doing so may interfere with your use of
the Resource. We may use the third party&rsquo;s services which may contain cookies due to their cookies policy.
</p>
<p><strong>Password</strong></p>
<p>
Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do
not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others,
remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your
password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding
actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access
your profile on the Resource to change your password and notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a>
</p>
<p><strong>Your Rights</strong></p>
<p>
You can see, review and change most of your personal information by logging into the Resource. You must promptly
update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. If you deactivate your account, your profile page
will not be visible but all your posted content will still be accessible. In addition to the foregoing, we retain
personal information from closed accounts, if and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including in
order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with
any investigations, enforce our Resource-related agreements, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law or as
specified elsewhere in this Policy.
</p>
<p>
If at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to share with or disclose to non-agent third parties your
personal information in the future, or if you wish to request access to, or deletion or modification of, any
personal information that we have about you that we do not already make available to you for your review and
deletion or modification, contact us directly via email to <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a>. Upon
receipt and process of a reasonable opt-out request, we will comply with such request to the reasonable extent
within a commercially reasonable period of time. Note that requests to terminate disclosure to third parties may
frustrate or render impossible our ability to maintain the Resource or conduct transactions initiated by you.<br />
