                <strong>Your Use of the Resource</strong><br />
                <br />

                <a name="cookies"></a><strong>Cookie Policy</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Resource may utilize &quot;cookies&quot;, which are small text files placed on your computer or device. We also use pixel tags, web beacons and other similar technologies. Such devices are used to help analyze our web page flow, customize our services, optimize our user interfaces, measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. With these devices, we collect data such as the identity of the applicable internet service provider, the user&#39;s IP address of his or her terminal device, the type of browser software and operating system in use, the date and time of Resource access, the website address, if any, from which the user linked to the Resource, and other similar traffic-related information. We may also aggregate such information with similar data collected from other users and disclose such aggregate information to third parties. Certain features are only available through the use of cookies, and generally we need to use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. You are always free to decline Resource cookies via your browser settings, although, doing so may interfere with your use of the Resource. We may use the third party&rsquo;s services which may contain cookies due to their cookies policy.</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Password</strong></p>
            <p>
                <br />
                Your password deserves careful thought and protection. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do not disclose your password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. If your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately access your profile on the Resource to change your password and notify us immediately at <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a></p>

If you deactivate your account, your profile page will not be visible but all your posted content will still be accessible. In addition to the foregoing, we retain personal information from closed accounts, if and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including in order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Resource-related agreements, and take other actions otherwise permitted by law or as specified elsewhere in this Policy.</p>
            <p>
                If at any time you choose to opt out from allowing us to share with or disclose to non-agent third parties your personal information in the future, or if you wish to request access to, or deletion or modification of, any personal information that we have about you that we do not already make available to you for your review and deletion or modification, contact us directly via email to <a href="mailto:abuse@all.biz">abuse@all.biz</a>. Upon receipt and process of a reasonable opt-out request, we will comply with such request to the reasonable extent within a commercially reasonable period of time.

            <p>
                <br />
                <strong>Applicability</strong><br />
                <br />
                Except as otherwise expressly included in this Policy, this document addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
