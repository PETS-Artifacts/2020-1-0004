</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Using cookies:</b>  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using.  Cookies allow us to recognize your computer and to collect information such as internet browser type, time spent using the AIG Online Services, pages visited, language preferences and relevant country website.  We may use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the AIG Online Services, or to gather statistical information about the usage of the AIG Online Services in order to understand how they are used, continually improve their design and functionality, and assist us with resolving questions about them.  Cookies further allow us to present to you the advertisements or offers that are most likely to appeal to you.  We may also use cookies to track your responses to our advertisements and we may use cookies or other files to track your use of other websites. We do not respond to browser do-not-track signals at this time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a description of all the cookies we use on our websites, what they do, what data about you they collect and what we use them for:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Geo Location cookie </b> – When a visitor visits one of our sites for the first time we read their location from their IP address and use this information to  assume the country site that they want to visit.  This method is not entirely accurate, however, so when they navigate to a particular country site we use a cookie to store this information and to store the language that they chose to view the site.  The next time they visit the site we read the cookie and present the same country and language version they used on their last visit. This has the intended benefit that they don’t need to reselect the country site they need each time they visit an AIG site.  No Personal Information is collected or used by the cookie.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Site Catalyst cookie (by Adobe) & Google Analytics</b> – These cookies enable us to collect and analyze data about how visitors arrive at our site and then how they interact with our site, including products they may search, content they may view, and the steps leading up to a completed or abandoned sale.  We use this aggregated information to adapt our sites to better serve their and other users’ needs and interests, and to provide more relevant and useful information. The cookie is placed on a visitor’s PC on a temporary basis only.  These cookies do not collect or use their Personal Information.  Instead, it logs an anonymous code which identifies users and this code “follows” the user in their journey through the site.  We use the aggregated and anonymous information for statistical analysis. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting</b>– We’ve enabled Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting features on our site. This is used to help guide us on aggregated data of our visitors such as gender, age and interest categories. This data may be used in conjunction with Google AdWords and DoubleClick services to enhance our advertising directed towards you while strictly adhering to personalized advertising policies outlined by Google. You can update your Google advertising settings via Google’s <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated">Ad Settings</a> or using Google’s <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/">Opt Out add-on</a>.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>DoubleClick cookies</b> - We place a tracking pixel cookie on to all site visitors’ computers for the purpose of our banner advertising activity. We use these cookies to know that a visitor has been on our site before which allows us to display an appropriate banner ad on to an affiliated network website. No Personal Information is collected.  One of the advertisement companies that we use is Google, Inc, trading as DoubleClick.  For more information on the DoubleClick cookie, or to opt out from the DoubleClick advertisement cookie please visit: <a href="http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/</a> .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Affiliate cookie</b> – We use a tracking pixel cookie, which is put on a visitor’s PC and collects only the transaction ID (which identifies the affiliated website the visitor has come from) and a time and date stamp.  This enables our affiliate network partners to track affiliated sales and ensure an affiliate is credited for a sale referred to us. It does not involve any passing of Personal Information. </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Optimost cookie</b> – Optimost is a service provided by Hewlett-Packard to analyse customer behavior when visiting our site.  This service allows us to test variations of our website pages or elements within the pages.  The tests will usually result in improvements to the website and the user experience. The cookie has an anonymous “visitor ID” which is a random number generated to identify a visitor, to distinguish between unique and/or repeat visitors. These cookies do not collect Personal Information. To view the Optimost privacy policy, please visit: <a href="https://asp.optimost.com/avatar/privacy-policy">https://asp.optimost.com/avatar/privacy-policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Oracle Cookie</b> - We use the services of <a href="http://www.oracle.com">www.oracle.com</a> to serve a persistent cookie on visitors’ browsers when they first visit our web pages, unless there is already an Oracle cookie on their browser because they have visited a non-AIG site which is also using Oracle’s services.  However, visitors’ browsing activity on our web pages will not be combined with visitors’ browsing behaviour on other websites using Oracle’s services.  We use visitors’ browsing activity on our web pages to understand which pages and content our visitors use or do not use so that we can monitor our site content to best meet our visitors' needs.  For further information please read the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/legal/privacy/privacy-policy-078584.html">Oracle privacy policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>SessionCam</b> - We also use the SessionCam web site recording service. SessionCam is a product that has been developed by <a href="http://www.servicetick.com">www.servicetick.com</a>.  SessionCam may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. The information collected does not include bank details or any sensitive information and it is for internal use only.  Information collected is used to improve our website usability and is stored and used for aggregated and statistical reporting.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Appsee Analytics Service</b> - Appsee may collect and store certain data about your activity in this app and track touch gestures, scrolling activity and user interaction activity. This application does not use Appsee to collect any of your personally identifiable information. Appsee does not track your activity across applications which do not use Appsee Analytics Service. For more information, see the Privacy Policy for information collected by Appsee Analytics Service (available at <a href="https://www.appsee.com/legal/privacypolicy" target="_blank">www.appsee.com/legal/privacypolicy</a>).
