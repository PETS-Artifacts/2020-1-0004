<p>Sometimes, as part of our business operations, decisions about you are taken using automated computer software and systems.  These decisions do not involve human input, and the software and systems apply pre-defined logic programming and criteria to make a decision and assess how we deal with you in connection with the provision of services.</p>
<p>For example, we sometimes use automated decision making as part of a process to:</p>
<ul>
<li>decide whether a travel insurance claim should be paid as requested (for example, if pre-specified criteria are met by responses that you provide, the claim will be paid automatically without the need for additional human intervention); or</li>
<li>identify known pre-existing medical conditions in connection with our travel insurance business to decide whether we can offer insurance to you and on what terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We provide you with more information in relation to any automated decision processes before or at the time that we intend to make decisions in this way. You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing.

<p>Due to the global nature of our business activities, for the purposes set out above (see section entitled '<b>How do we use Personal Information?</b>'), depending on the nature of our relationship with you, we will transfer Personal Information to parties located in other countries (including the USA, China, Mexico, Malaysia, Philippines, Bermuda and other countries that have data protection regimes which are different to those in the country where you are based, including countries which have not been found to provide adequate protection for Personal Information by the European Commission).  </p>
<p>For example, we may transfer Personal Information in order to process international travel insurance claims and provide emergency medical assistance services when you are abroad.  We may transfer information internationally to our group companies, service providers, business partners, government or public authorities, and other third parties.</p>
<p>When making these transfers, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected and transferred in accordance with the requirements of data protection law. </p>
<p>This typically involves the use of data transfer agreements in the form approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (<b>GDPR</b>) (the relevant data protection law). If there is no data transfer agreement in place, we may use other mechanisms recognised by the GDPR as ensuring an adequate level of protection for Personal Information transferred outside the EEA (for example, the US Privacy Shield framework or any framework that replaces it).</p>

<p>AIG uses appropriate technical, physical, legal and organisational measures, which comply with data protection laws to keep Personal Information secure. </p>
<p>As most of the Personal Information we hold is stored electronically we have implemented appropriate IT security measures to ensure this Personal Information is kept secure.  For example, we may use anti-virus protection systems, firewalls, and data encryption technologies.  We have procedures in place at our premises to keep any hard copy records physically secure.  We also train our staff regularly on data protection and information security.</p>
<p>When AIG engages a third party (including our service providers) to collect or otherwise process Personal Information on our behalf, the third party will be selected carefully and required to use appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or electronic data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any Personal Information you might have sent to us has been compromised), please immediately notify us (see section below ‘<b>Who to contact about your Personal Information?</b>’).</p>

<p>Data protection law seeks to ensure that the way Personal Information is used is fair. <b></b></p>
<p>To comply with the law, we need to tell you the legal justification we rely on for using your Personal Information.<b></b></p>
<p>While the law provides several legal justifications, the table below describes the main legal justifications that apply to our purposes for using Personal Information.<b></b></p>
<p>We may be required to obtain Personal Information from you to comply with applicable legal requirements, and certain Personal Information may be needed to enable us to fulfil the terms of our contract with you (or someone else), or in preparation of entering into a contract with you (or someone else). We may inform you of this at the time that we are obtaining the Personal Information from you.  In these circumstances, if you do not provide the relevant Personal Information to us, we may not be able to provide our products or services to you.  If you would like further information, please contact us using the details below (see section below ‘<b>Who to contact about your Personal Information</b>?’).<b></b></p>
<p><b><i>Sensitive Special Categories of Personal Information</i></b></p>
<p>For more sensitive special categories of Personal Information we will rely on either:<b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>your consent; or<b></b></li>
<li>one or more of the other legal justifications set out in the table below <u>and</u> typically one of the following two additional justifications (however other legal justifications may be available):<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">o    the use is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity (for example, when a court issues a court order requiring the processing of Personal Information); or<b></b></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">o    the use is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis or the provision of health or social care or treatment.</p>
<p>These more sensitive special categories of Personal Information include Personal Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
<p>Additional legal justifications may also be available in the country in which you are based and we may also rely on these justifications from time to time.</p>
<p>Processing of Personal Information relating to criminal convictions and offences is subject to the requirements of applicable law.</p>

<ul>
<li>pursuit of our commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party (for example, by carrying out direct marketing);</li>
<li>compliance with applicable legal and regulatory obligations, and any guidelines, standards and codes of conduct (for example, by carrying out background checks or otherwise preventing, detecting or investigating fraud or money laundering);</li>

</ul>
<p>We may need to collect, use and disclose Personal Information in connection with matters of important public interest, for instance when complying with our obligations under anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and regulations, and other laws and regulations aimed at preventing financial crime.  In these cases, the legal justification for our use of Personal Information is that the use is necessary for matters of public interest. Additional justifications may also apply depending on the circumstances.</p>

<p>We will keep Personal Information for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we collect it.  The precise period will depend on the purpose for which we hold your information.  In addition, as a regulated financial services institution, there are laws and regulations that apply to us which set minimum periods for retention of Personal Information.<i> </i>We will provide you with further information if appropriate to give you a full picture of how we collect and use your Personal Information.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where we hold Personal Information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, we will keep the information for at least as long as is required to comply with that obligation.</li>
<li>Where we hold Personal Information in order to provide a product or service (such as an insurance policy and claims handling), we will keep the information for at least as long as we provide the product or service, and for a number of years after expiry of the policy and the handling of any related claim. </li>
</ul>
<p>The number of years varies depending on the nature of the product or service provided – for example, for certain insurance policies it may be necessary to keep the Personal Information for several years after the expiry of the policy.  Among other reasons, we retain the information in order to respond to any queries or concerns that may be raised at a later date with respect to the policy or the handling of a claim.  Typically, for consumer insurance products, the retention period is seven (7) years.</p>
