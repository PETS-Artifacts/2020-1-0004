If you are such an employee or individual and are seeking access to, or would like to correct, amend or delete, Customer PI, you should direct your query to the applicable customer (but the foregoing will not limit EU individuals from requesting EU Data as provided below). We will respond within a reasonable timeframe to a customer’s request to remove Customer PI.</p><p>We will not use Customer PI except for the purpose of providing and supporting the Services for the applicable customer. Customer PI will be retained for as long as needed for that purpose and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p><h2 id=security>Security</h2><p>Datadog has implemented security measures to protect personal information from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.</p><h2 id=transfer-of-information-to-the-u-s-and-other-countries>Transfer of Information to the U.S. and Other Countries</h2><p>Datadog is based in the United States and the information we collect is governed by U.S. law. By accessing or using the Services or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the U.S. and other countries, where you may not have the same rights and protections as you do under local law.</p><p>In connection with Datadog’s processing of personal data it receives in the U.S. from the European Union (“EU Data”), Datadog participates in, and has certified its compliance with, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. Datadog is committed to subjecting all EU Data, in reliance on the Framework, to the Framework’s applicable Principles. For purposes of enforcing compliance with the Framework, Datadog is subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. For more information about the Principles, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s <a href=https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome>Privacy Shield website</a>.</p><p>Without limiting the above, Datadog adheres to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer. As noted in “Sharing of Information” above, we may transfer personal information (including EU Data) to our vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such EU Data to carry out work on our behalf. Under certain circumstances, we may remain liable for the acts of those third-party service providers for their handling of EU Data that we transfer to them. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to disclose EU Data in response to valid requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p><p>EU individuals have rights to access personal data about them, and to limit use and disclosure of their personal data. If you believe Datadog holds EU Data about you, and wish to request access (or to limit use or disclosure) of such EU Data, you can submit a written request to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If the requested EU Data is Customer PI, please include the name of the applicable customer in your request; we will refer the request to that customer to respond directly to you and will support them as needed to respond to your request. We will respond to all requests within a reasonable timeframe. You may also contact the customer directly as noted in the “Information Collected on Behalf of Customers” section above.</p><p>Please direct any inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Principles to the point of contact listed in the “Contact Us” section below. If Datadog does not resolve your complaint, you may submit your complaint free of charge to Datadog’s U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider and designated Privacy Shield dispute resolution provider here: <a href=https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request>https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request</a>. Under certain conditions specified by the Principles and more fully described on the Privacy Shield website at <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint</a>, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.</p><h2 id=your-choices>Your Choices</h2><p>Account Information</p><p>Our customers may access, update or change personal information they have provided by logging into the Services or emailing us at <a href=mailto:help@datadoghq.com>help@datadoghq.com</a>.</p><p>Customers may deactivate their accounts by emailing us at <a href=mailto:help@datadoghq.com>help@datadoghq.com</a>, but note that we may retain certain personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations or for legitimate business purposes, such as to resolve disputes or enforce our agreements. We may also retain cached or archived copies of personal information for a certain period of time.</p><p>If you are an individual with whom one of our customers interacts with respect to the Services (e.g., an employee of a customer), as noted above, you should direct any requests regarding access, modification or deletion of personal information to the applicable customer.</p><p>Cookies</p><p>Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Services.</p><p>Promotional Communications</p><p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from Datadog by following the instructions in those emails or by emailing <a href=mailto:help@datadoghq.com>help@datadoghq.com</a>.
