<p>
At AboutEspañol, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns
of our community of users. In this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) we describe
our privacy practices with regard to information we collect through AboutEspanol.com
and affiliated sites and email properties (collectively, the “Site“), to help
you make informed decisions about how you share information when you visit or
use the site.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on AboutEspañol:</h3>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
</p>
<p>
We may collect information, including personal data,
directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example,
you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email
address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up
for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.
</p>
<p>
You also may choose to provide personally data about
yourself when you participate in forums or discussions on the Site.
Please be aware that information you post may be
viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should
avoid posting sensitive or personal data that you would not want to
be available to the public.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit AboutEspañol</h4>
</p>
<p>
When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners may automatically
collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons,
and other similar technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit
the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system,
information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer
or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers,
clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site).
We or our third-party partners may combine information that each of us collects
automatically with other information about you, including information you choose to provide.
</p>
<p>
<b>Cookies</b> are small files that websites and other online services use to store
information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies
(such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local
storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit 
<a
href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/"
target="_blank"
rel="noopener nofollow"
> http://www.allaboutcookies.org
</a><!-- end: --> . See the section below regarding <a href="#your-choices">Your choices</a> to
learn more about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If
you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the
Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality.
</p>
<p>
To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred
to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you. 
<b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers
and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as
counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate
around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened
and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.
</p>
<p>
We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics,
on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about
visitors to the Site.
</p>
<p>
<b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b>
Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track”
signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is
no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track”
in this context. Like many other websites, AboutEspanol.com is not
configured to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers.

</a><!-- end: --> </p>
<p>
Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets,
and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like”
buttons), also may use automated means to collect information regarding
your interactions with these features. This information collection is
subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers.
</p>
<p>
Further information regarding our use of cookies and other tracking
technologies is described in our <a href="#cookies">Cookie Disclosure.</a>

<p>

</p>
<ul type="disc">

<h4>How We Protect Personal Data.</h4>
</p>
<p>
We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards
designed to protect the personal data you provide against
accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration,
access, disclosure, or use. That said, it is not possible to guarantee the
security of information transmitted online, and you assume some risk with
regard to the security of information you provide through any website,
including this Site. If you have a data security inquiry, you may contact
us by emailing <a href="mailto:security@AboutEspanol.com">security@AboutEspanol.com</a>.
To request an invite to our bug bounty program to submit reports on
vulnerabilities found on AboutEspanol.com, you may contact us by emailing

</p>
<p>
<h4>Links From AboutEspañol to Other Websites</h4>
</p>
<p>
On this Site, we may provide links to other websites that are controlled by
third parties. Linked websites may have their own privacy notices or
policies, which we strongly suggest you review. We are not responsible for
the content, usage terms, privacy policies, or any other aspects of
websites that we do not own or control.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Surveys and Quizzes</h4>
</p>
<p>
While you are visiting AboutEspañol, you may have the opportunity to
participate in surveys, quizzes, or other interactive features
that request information about you and your opinions and preferences. Your
participation in these features is entirely voluntary. If you do choose to
participate, please be aware that these features may be operated by a third
party that is not controlled by AboutEspañol, and therefore the information
you provide may be collected by the third party and subject to its privacy
policy.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Children’s Privacy</h4>
</p>
<p>
This Site is not designed or intended for use by children, and we do not
knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 16.
If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child

<p>
<h4>Information for Users Outside the United States</h4>
</p>
<p>
Your personal data may be stored, transferred and process in and to the
United States and in other countries by our affiliates and/or service
providers. The data protection laws in these countries may provide a
lower standard of protection for your personal data than your country
of residence. We take great care in protecting your personal data and
have put in place adequate mechanisms to protect it when it is transferred
internationally. We will transfer your personal data in compliance with
applicable data protection laws and will implement suitable safeguards
to ensure that your personal data is adequately secured by any third
party that will access your information (for instance, by using the Model
Clauses as approved by the European Commission).
</p>
<p>
By using our Site and providing personal data to us, you consent to the
terms of this Privacy Policy and the collection, use, maintenance, transfer
to and processing of your personal data in the United States or other
countries or territories, and, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy,
we use this consent as the legal basis for that data transfer.
</p>
<p>

international transfer of your personal data or the implemented safeguards,
