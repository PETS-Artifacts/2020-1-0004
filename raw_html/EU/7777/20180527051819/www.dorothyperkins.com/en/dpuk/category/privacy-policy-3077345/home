              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>This is the Dorothy Perkins privacy policy to explain how and why we use your personal information. It&#8217;s important, so please read it and make sure you control your privacy. Our website and apps are not intended for use by children who are under 16 years of age. We know you are busy, so to help, our policy lets you chose how much you want to know: quick read, or detail. [+]</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p><strong>Our privacy principles</strong></p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>We take your privacy seriously.</p>

              <p>We are committed to protecting the security of your personal information.</p>

              <p>We comply with data privacy laws when using your personal information.</p>

              <p>We only use it for lawful reasons you expect or that we explain to you in this document.</p>

              <p>We will limit our collection and use to details we really need or which you have provided.</p>

              <p>We will explain your rights to control your personal information to you and how to use them.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p><strong>Quick read: Privacy Policy Summary</strong></p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>We want you to understand:</p>

              <ol>
                <li><strong>What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from</strong></li>

                <li><strong>What we do with your personal information</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Who we share your personal information with and why</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Where we send your personal information outside Europe</strong></li>

                <li><strong>How we keep your personal information secure</strong></li>

                <li><strong>How long we keep your information and why</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Your rights and how to use them</strong></li>

                <li><strong>Other details you should know</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <ol>
                <li><strong>What personal information we collect about you and where we get it from</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>We collect most information directly from you when you order or buy from us. We get technical details from the devices you use to access our apps and websites and from cookies which tell us what you look at online, where and when. Like most other websites, our technology also lets us know when and how you use our websites, such as when you have added to or abandoned your basket or filled in a form.</p>

              <p>The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it. We will only collect the personal information we believe we need to use, or which you have agreed we can collect from you or agreed someone else can share with us, such as Unidays to confirm student status.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>Sometimes we are given information about you unexpectedly, such as from the police, organisations and agencies trying to prevent threats and fraud, and from the public. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO1">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p>&#160;&#160;</p>

              <ol start="2">
                <li><strong>What we do with your personal information</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>We need to collect and use lots of information about you so that you can use our websites and apps, shop in our stores, buy things from us and learn about our offers and new arrivals. We also need to use some details to prevent and detect fraud.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>We look at and learn from your browsing, shopping and how you respond to our marketing to understand what sort of customer you are and predict what products we have that you may also be interested in. We try to show you adverts and offers we think you will like tailored to you based on stuff like your location, including what we know about you including through our apps, websites and other websites you visit, relying on the extra understanding about you which ad providers and social media platforms have collected with your consent.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>Our use of your details will depend on you and what you are doing: browsing or buying, if you are new to us or a registered customer. Use will be different on-line and in-store but we will try to join up details of our relationship with you in store and online in our records, even if you use different devices online. We explain our lawful reasons for use of your personal information in our detail section. You can access this by scrolling to &#8220;Additional Details&#8221;.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <ol start="3">
                <li><strong>Who we share your personal information with and why</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>We use suppliers and service providers, such as for delivering orders, or dealing with card checks and payments. These include other group companies and external contractors. We only share the personal details they need to know for their services and we make sure your privacy is respected and protected.</p>

              <p>We share personal information with third parties when you have told us that we can share, or them that they can share, or you agree we can share your information, such as when you register to use a &#8216;Style adviser&#8217; function we offer which is provided by a third party, or with third party ad providers, such as social media platforms or Google, so our adverts are shown to you. &#160;We will share agreed details with third parties like Newday if you choose to use their store card, or Klarna if you choose to use their payment service, for the purpose of enabling the service which you have sought to use.</p>

              <p>We will provide personal information about you to the police, fraud prevention and credit reference agencies when we have to by law, or when we deem necessary to prevent fraud. &#160;If we decide to reorganise or sell all or most of our business, your personal information may be transferred to the buyer of the business but we will never sell your personal information to third parties for them to market their products to you. &#160;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO3">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <ol start="4">
                <li><strong>Where we send your personal information outside Europe</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>Business for us and many suppliers is international so your personal information may, at times, be handled in a location outside Europe. When this occurs, we take care in ensuring the security of your information. In the event you ask us to deliver your order outside of Europe, we need to send limited details outside of Europe to fulfil this request.&#160;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO4">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <ol start="5">
                <li><strong>How do we keep your personal information secure</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>Our people understand how important it is to keep your personal information safe and secure. We take steps &#160;online and in store &#160;to keep our stores and offices, systems and records secure.&#160;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO5">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <ol start="6">
                <li><strong>How long we keep your information and why</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>We will only keep your personal information for a limited period of time. This period will depend on a number of reasons, such whether we still need to deliver to you, or you have an account with us, or we are providing ongoing customer care to you. Sometimes we must also keep your information by law, to deal with a regulator or where required by our insurers. We delete your personal information at your request where possible and we won&#8217;t keep it for longer than we should or need to for the provision of a service and for communicating with you.&#160;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO6">[In detail] [+]</a></p>

              <ol start="7">
                <li><strong>Your rights and how to use them</strong></li>
              </ol>

              <p>You have rights to find out about how and why we use your personal information and to control its use. These include rights to access and correct your details, in some cases to ask us to limit or stop our use of them and even to delete them. &#160;Where we use your personal information based on your consent, you have the right to change your mind and you can always unsubscribe from our direct marketing to you, by simply clicking unsubscribe in a marketing email, or in this policy. &#160;</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>Your privacy matters, so we have appointed a Data Protection Officer and have a Data Protection Team to help. You can get in touch with our Customer Care team for help with data protemtion matters at customer.service@dorothyperkins.com. You also have a right to complain to the UK&#8217;s privacy regulator should you feel your rights or the law has been compromised.</p>

              <p>Our privacy policy explains how we at Dorothy Perkins are responsible for using your personal information. If you would like to get in touch, you can write to us at: Customer Care, Burton Business Park, Torre Road, Leeds, LS9 7DN, United Kingdom. You can also email us at customer.service@dorothyperkins.com.</p>

              <p>From time to time we will update this policy. We&#8217;ll always send you a copy in the event of material change but if minor changes are made, we won&#8217;t bombard your mailbox. You can, of course, check back here for updates in the mean time!&#160;<a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#NO8">[In detail][+]</a></p>

              <p>Where we collect and use information about you and which allows us to identify you, it is your personal information. Our quick read summary privacy policy has already given you some key facts but this part of our policy adds further detail if you want to understand more about how and why we use your information.</p>

              <p>The personal information we collect and use will depend on why we need it and whether you are buying or browsing, in-store, or online. The technical term for information about you which identifies you is your personal data. We need lots of different types of information and have explained what categories we collect, why it is needed and where we get it from below. Collection and use of this information is not new and is commonly used by lots of retailers, but explaining this level of detail to you is new!</p>

They will not collect your name, address and payment card details but send back technical facts.&#160; They also help us to understand and sort out technical errors which sometimes happen online. We need cookies to make our websites and your device able to work well together. Some cookies are our own but we also work with carefully selected third parties to help us and who set their cookies from our website pages and to help us run our websites (these are called third party cookies).&#160; You will not be able to buy from us online and your browsing experience may not be as enjoyable if you block your device from receiving cookies.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>We use cookies online to do the job a good sales assistant does in store, noting what you are interested in, seeing if we can help show you where those items are, find more like them and tell you about products which work well with them. We can also tell you about special offers and promotions, just like they would.</p>

              <p>Personal information does not include information where your identity has been removed or is unknown (anonymous data). &#160;Some of this information may only be identifiable to you and personal because you are logged in to your account, or because we have collected details of your IP address or the device that you have used to access the website. Where we can, we prefer to show you adverts online which you are more likely to be interested in.</p>

              <p>&#160;</p>

              <p>Normally until you buy from us, you are an unnamed user of our website but we want to make you a customer. We work with online advertising partners to do this. They set a cookie from our webpages and this allows them to spot when you use the same device on other websites they publish ads on. They can then make sure you see an ad from us (retargeting). In some cases, the ads you see from us online will be more tailored to you (tailored or behavioural ads). This uses known and observed information about you to try and categorise you and predict what you will want to buy and which offers you will most like (profiling). This will be from our knowledge of you as a customer with us and from your use of our websites but we do not share that detailed information with those advertising partners. In other cases, it will be based on what advertising partners /social media providers know about you from their cookies and use of their websites but we do not receive the detailed
              information from these websites.&#160;</p>

To do this, we can bunch lots of information on individuals together (aggregation), remove or change details that identify you to make that more difficult or impossible (de-identification, pseudonymisation and anonymization) and change information about people into information about numbers (statistics). This helps us to protect your privacy whilst having the information we need to run our business and comply with our obligations. We can use the details for research, statistical analysis, and reports.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>the country to which the personal information is to be transferred has been approved by them;&#160;</li>

                <li>the recipient of the personal information is legally bound to protect your personal information under binding corporate rules approved by them;</li>

                <li>we have made sure that there is a contract to protect your personal data with the recipient, using a template approved by them;</li>

                <li>the transfer is needed for another reason approved by them, such as to make an international delivery at your request; or</li>

              <p>We take specific steps required by data privacy law to take appropriate care of your personal information, whether online or not.

                <li>whether you have placed an order with us, or have a registered account with us;</li>

                <li>the type of information that we hold about you; and</li>

              <p>We will keep your personal information during the period that you are a customer with us and then for as long as is necessary in connection with both our and your legal rights and obligations.
