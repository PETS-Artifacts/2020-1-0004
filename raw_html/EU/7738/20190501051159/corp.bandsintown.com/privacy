The collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy is based on your voluntary consent or on our contractual obligations to you or legitimate interest.

In addition to these three mandatory fields, we request access to your contacts stored within your Device to help you find your friends on the Services and access to your music library on your Device to help you find the music you love. If you do not use your email to register, you may register to use our services via Facebook or Spotify connect. The Information we collect from these thirds parties during registration includes your profile picture, age range, and gender in order to generate your user profile. We also collect information on artists you follow in order to track them on the Services. In addition to these required information, we ask for secondary information in order to personalize your experience. These optional fields are date of birth, gender, and contacts. We collect only the Personal Information necessary to provide the Services and to provide you with a more customized and relevant experience. If you’d like to utilize the Services for purchasing tickets, you may then be asked to provide your credit card information. When purchasing tickets you will be pushed to a third-party website that allows you enter your credit card and billing information and complete the ticketing transaction. We do not keep or process your credit card or billing information. Once you provide us with this information mentioned above, we offer you our additional Services such as RSVPing, liking or tracking your favorite bands, using the ticket concierge, or exploring artists similar to your favorite bands, receiving alerts for concerts in your area, etc.<br></p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Location Information: </strong>In order to provide you with information about concerts or promotions in your area, we ask your permission to collect location-based information from you or your Device, including your IP address, city, country, zip code, region, radius, time zone, GPS-based location information, and longitude/latitude. Your location is used to personalize the content you see within the Services. We may also collect other information based on your location and your Device’s proximity to “beacons” and other similar proximity systems, including, for example, the strength of the signal between the “beacon” and your Device and the duration that your Device is near the “beacon”. The type of location data we collect depends on a number of factors, including the type of Device you are using (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet) and the type of connection enabled on your Device (e.g., WiFi, Bluetooth, broadband cable). If you agree to allow access to your location, you agree that we and our service providers may collect such location-based information from your Device. We may use and share that location-based information with third parties to deliver, market and promote the content, services, features, products and advertising (and/or to verify your rights to receive such content, services, features and/or products) that are available through the Services. If you no longer wish to have this location information collected and used by us, you may “opt-out” by disabling the location and Bluetooth features in the operating system of your Device and/or in the Bandsintown App.<br></p></li><li><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>Music DNA: </strong>When you create an account, we will ask to scan the music library on your device, your social media accounts, and music subscription services in order to create a unique “music DNA”, which is your digital identity based on your music tastes. We will develop and refine your music DNA based on Artists you like while using the Services, Artists’ pages you follow and events you state you are attending. We will make additional music suggestions based on your music DNA. We will also use your Music DNA to provide relevant promotional emails and other forms of advertising to you.

Such Third Party Advertising Providers may enable us to display advertisements based on your use of the Services and other websites, services and platforms you have used or visited. These Third Party Advertising Providers may use their own Tracking Technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information. Bandsintown does not control these Third Party Advertising Providers and/or their use of Tracking Technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Advertising Provider.

However, no method of transmission over the Internet or via mobile device, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure – so we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should take certain steps to protect your account and Personal Information as well, such as by choosing a strong password and keeping such password private, and logging out of your account when you are finished using it.</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We are not responsible for protecting any Personal Information that we share with a third-party based on an account connection that you have authorized. &nbsp;Bandsintown will not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Privacy Policy because of a technical malfunction or a breach in security.<br><br><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Our Policy Regarding Children</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our Sites and Services are not directed to children under the age of 16. &nbsp;We do not knowingly collect Information from children under the age of 16.

We may continue to process your Information based on our legitimate interests or in order to fulfill our obligations under a contract and/or may also seek your affirmative consent to the terms of the updated Privacy Policy. &nbsp; For example, we may ask for your consent before implementing new uses of the Personal Information that we have already collected from you based on such consent, if such new use was not addressed by the privacy policy under which such information was collected or if our legal basis for processing such information changes. &nbsp;</p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accuracy</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">It is your responsibility to give us current, complete, truthful and accurate information, including Personal Information, and to keep such information up to date. We cannot and will not be responsible for any problems or liability that may arise if you do not give us accurate, truthful or complete Information or you fail to update such Information. We may reject or delete any Information or entry for any reason, including if we believe in good faith that the Information is false, fraudulent or inconsistent with this Privacy Policy or our <a href="http://corp.bandsintown.com/terms">Terms of Use.</a></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><strong>13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p><p style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you are a resident of the State of California, we provide you with information on how to exercise your disclosure choice options such as your right to opt-out (which we may sometimes refer to as “unsubscribe”) with respect to use of your Personal Information by third parties for marketing purposes.
