</header>
<p> Effective as of November 1, 2016, Zendesk, Inc., (“Zendesk”) and its subsidiaries, (collectively, the “Zendesk Group” or “we” or “us” or “our”) have updated our Privacy Policy (“Policy”). For a prior version of our Privacy Policy, click <a href="/company/zendesk-privacy-retro/">here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>1. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>This Policy details our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who visit our Websites (as herein defined) (“Website Visitors”), who register to use our Services, or who attend or register to attend sponsored events or other events at which the Zendesk Group participates (“Attendees”). For the purposes of this Policy, the term, “Websites”, shall refer collectively to <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/">www.zendesk.com</a> as well as the other websites that the Zendesk Group operates and that link to this Policy. </p>
<p><strong>2. Scope Of This Policy</strong></p>
<p> In addition to the Websites that link to this Policy, this Policy applies to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/apps/">Zendesk Marketplace</a>, which is an online marketplace for on-demand web applications utilized in conjunction with some of the Services. The Zendesk Group and third parties may post applications to the Zendesk Marketplace. When we post an application and the application links to this Policy, this Policy applies. When a third party posts an application, the privacy policy of the third party applies.
</li>
<li>
The <a href="https://developer.zendesk.com/">Zendesk Developer Portal</a>, which enables Subscribers to create web applications and other integrations with our Services. For the purposes of this Policy, “Subscriber”, as the term is used herein, shall refer to an individual or an entity that has agreed to a Service Agreement for use of our Services.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>In this Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.</p>
<p>Our Websites may contain links to other websites and the information practices and the content of such other websites are governed by the privacy statements of such other websites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any such other websites to understand their information practices.</p>
<p>With the exception of Account Information (as defined below) and other information we collect in connection with your registration or authentication into our Services (as defined below), this Policy does not apply to our security and privacy practices in connection with your access to and use of the products and services which we market for subscription on our Websites (our “Services”). These security and privacy practices, including how we protect, collect, and use electronic data, text, messages, communications or other materials submitted to and stored within the Services by You (“Service Data”), are detailed in and governed by our Master Subscription Agreement, available <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/master-subscription-agreement/?cta=msa">here</a>, or such other applicable agreement between you and any member of the Zendesk Group relating to your access to and use of such Services (“Service Agreement”).</p>
<p>Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as any and all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services, then you will be directed to contact our Subscriber for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information. </p>
<p>We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services (such as a customer of one of our Subscribers) and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Subscribers that use our Services, please contact the Subscriber that you interact with directly.</p>
<p>We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties for these purposes are governed by the Service Agreements with our Subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>3. Information That You Provide To Us</strong></p>
<p><strong>Account and Registration Information:</strong><br/>We ask for and collect personal information about you such as your name, address, phone number, email address, instant messaging ID, and credit card information, as well as certain related information like your company name and website name, when you register for an account to access or utilize one or more of our Services (an “Account”). We also ask for and collect personal information such as an email address and a name or alias from any individual that you authorize to log into and utilize our Services in connection with Your Account.</p>
<p>If you sign-up for a free trial Account, you are not required to enter your credit card information unless and until you decide to continue with a paid subscription to our Services. A third-party intermediary is used to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information for any purpose except for credit card processing on our behalf. </p>
<p>We refer to any information described above as “Account Information” for the purposes of this Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Account Information, you represent that you are the owner of such personal data or are otherwise authorized to provide it to us.</p>
<p><strong>Other Submissions:</strong><br/>We ask for and collect personal information from you when you submit web forms on our Websites or as you use interactive features of the Websites, including, participation in surveys, contests, promotions, sweepstakes, requesting customer support, or communicating with us. </p>
<p><strong>Attendee Information:</strong><br/>We ask for and collect personal information such as your name, address, phone number and email address when you register for or attend a sponsored event or other events at which any member of the Zendesk Group participates.</p>
<p><strong>4. Information That We Collect From You on our Websites</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies:</strong><br/>We and our authorized partners use cookies and other information gathering technologies for a variety of purposes. These technologies may provide us with personal information, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Websites, and other information regarding your interactions with our Websites. For detailed information about the use of cookies in the Websites, please read and review our Cookie Policy found <a href="https://www.zendesk.com/company/customers-partners/cookie-policy/?cta=cookie">here</a>.</p>
<p>We partner with third parties to either display advertising on the Websites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on our Websites and other sites in order to suggest advertisements based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking <a href="http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/">here</a> (or if located in the European Union click <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">here</a>). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads and you will continue to receive generic ads.</p>
<p>Web beacons, tags and scripts may be used on our Websites or in email or other electronic communications we send to you. These assist us in delivering cookies, counting visits to our Websites, understanding usage and campaign effectiveness and determining whether an email has been opened and acted upon. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by our third-party service providers on an individual and aggregated basis. </p>
<p>We use Local Storage Objects (“LSOs”) such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Websites or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML5 and Flash to collect and store information.
