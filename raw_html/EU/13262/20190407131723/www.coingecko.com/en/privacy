</p>
<p>
2.2 As part of the Anonymised Data that we collect, when you access our Website via your mobile device or tablet, we will also collect information regarding the type of mobile device or tablet that you are utilising so that our Website, App and/or Site Services can provide you with the version of our Website and/or App best suited for access on your mobile device or tablet.

In the event that you choose to access our Website or our Site Services without blocking or disabling or opting out of the Acceptable Technologies, such access by you will constitute your consent to our use of the Acceptable Technologies and our collection of information thereto.
</p>
<p>
2.4 To better assist you in understanding the generally Accepted Technologies used in our collection of Anonymised Data include:-
</br>
2.4.1 “IP Address” refers to a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet. Under certain circumstances, your IP Address remains the same from browser session to browser session. However, in the event that a consumer Internet access provider is utilised, your IP Address will likely vary from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyse the flow of webpages on our Website.
</br>
2.4.2 “Cookies” refer to small pieces of data that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive or mobile device’s internal storage while you are viewing the said website. Our Website utilises both session cookies (they expire the moment your Internet browser is closed) and persistent cookies (they will remain in your computer until you actively take steps to delete them) so as to provide you with a more personalised and interactive experience on our Website. By changing the options on your Internet browser and adjusting the settings in your mobile device (subject to your version of operation system and your device’s features), you can control whether to accept or decline cookies.
</br>
2.4.3 “Clear GIFs” refer to clear electronic images that are used to track your opening of webpages on our Website and your pattern of browsing our webpages as well as your access of our Website, for the purpose of allowing us to assess the attractiveness of the content on our Website, and the flow of webpages and layouts that appeal to you. Clear GIFs are also commonly known as "web beacons" and may be included on our Website, and generally works in conjunction with cookies to identify users and user behaviour. Some of our HTML based emails also utilise Clear GIFs in order for us to assess what are the emails we sent that have been opened and acted upon. Clear GIFs collect only limited data, such as a cookie number, the time and date of when a particular webpage, feature or service on our Website is accessed, and a description of the webpage, feature or service on our Website in which the clear GIF resides. Such collected Anonymised Data helps us to determine the effectiveness of the way our webpages, features and services are arranged on our Website, our modes of communications and promotional campaigns.
</br>
2.4.4 "Third-party web analytics" refer to services provided by third party service providers for the assessment, analysis, measurement and reporting of the behaviour of visitors to a website in order to assess and improve the effectiveness of the website. One of the most well-known third-party analytics service is "Google Analytics".
</br>
2.4.5 “HTML5 local storage” refer to caching services utilizing primarily a cache manifest file, which allows for storage of your preferences offline which will then be updated and synchronized when you go online.
</br>
2.4.6 “Dynamic device identifiers” refer to “identifier for advertisers” or “IFA”, which is a random, anonymous number assigned to an end-user of the iPhone or iPad and is temporary, allowing it to be blocked like a cookie. When an end-user views an application or browses the internet, the end-user’s presence generates a call for an advertisement as the publisher’s site that the end-user is viewing will pass the IFA to the ad server and the advertiser is then able to serve the end-user with an advertisement relevant to the topic being viewed. IFA can also be used to identify whether the advertisements resulted in end-users downloading applications or purchasing products that were advertised. The IFA does not identify the end-user personally, it provides an aggregated audience data that advertisers can target with advertisements. IFA can be opted out of via the settings in the end-user’s device (by default, the IFA is enabled), subject to the availability of such options in the version of your operating system and the features of your device.
</br>

14.3 In the event that your Personal Data has been collected based on our (or a relevant third party’s) legitimate interests, the said legitimate interest is generally for the operation of our Company and the provision of our services, managing our relationship with you such as updating your Activity Post listing, account status, communicating with you in order to provide you with our services and products (whether developed by our Company or third parties as made available via our Site), updates to our Website, App, APIs, Content, Site Services, Activity Post listings, activities, events, offers, and other legitimate business interest such as replying to your requests, sending you Updates, maintaining your Activity Post, communicating with you on your Activity Post, developing our Website, our App, our APIs, our Site Services, our other products and our services, offering promotions, publicity, or security enhancements, crime prevention and fraud detection. Should we have other legitimate interests, we will where appropriate notify you of them clearly at the relevant time.
</p>
<p>
14.4 In the event that you are requested to provide your Personal Data in order to enter into a contract with us, or for compliance with a legal obligation, we will make it clear to you at the appropriate juncture and advise you accordingly as to whether the provision of your Personal Data is indispensable, together with the possible consequences that may ensue should you still choose not to provide your Personal Data under the circumstances. To illustrate, in the event that you request for us to send you regular updates on the latest news regarding cryptocurrency trading volume, in order for you to receive such updates and fully benefit from and utilize our services, your Personal Data would have to be provided to us and processed as per the above provisions of this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
14.5 Your Personal Data will be retained and processed securely for as long as there is still ongoing legitimate commercial need for such retention and processing. Examples of legitimate commercial needs would be to allow you to continue accessing our Website, to maintain your Activity Post listing on our Website, to maintain your account, subscription or membership, providing Updates and other services to you, investigating and defending any potential legal action or claim against us, and as may be required or permitted by applicable laws (including laws pertaining to taxation and keeping of accounting records). As soon as there is no more legitimate business or legal needs for us to retain and process your Personal Data, your Personal Data will be deleted or anonymised (where possible), and in the event that it is not possible (such as storage of Personal Data in backup archives), we will ensure the security of your Personal Data that is being stored, segregate it so that no further processing will be carried out using your Personal Data, and will delete your Personal Data once possible.
</p>
<p>
14.6 As we are a business based in Singapore, your Personal Data will be transferred to countries that are not members of the European Union, including countries such as Singapore which may not mandate the same obligations of data protection as the European Union. Nonetheless, please be assured that we adopt appropriate measures to ensure that recipients (as described in Section 4 above) of your Personal Data are bound to obligations of protection, security and confidentiality similar to the obligations hereunder this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to the use of contractual clauses in our contracts/terms and conditions with such recipients.
</p>
<p>
