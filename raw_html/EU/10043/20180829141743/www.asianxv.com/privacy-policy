Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognizes that cookie, and allow a website to recognize a user&rsquo;s device. We currently use the following types of cookies:</p>

            <p>Cookies that are strictly necessary: These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. These include, for example, cookies that enable a user to log in to our Website and to check if a user is allowed access to a particular service or content.

These cookies help us to improve our Website, for example by ensuring that all users are able to find what they are looking for easily. Functionality cookies: These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience on our Website.

Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.</p>

            <p>Purposes for Which We Use Your Personal Information</p>

            <p>In general, we use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including Personal Information and Sensitive Personal Information, for following purposes:</p>

Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the entity to which we transfer your personal information uses it in a manner that is consistent with this privacy policy.

            <p>We will only retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

            <p>Where we no longer need to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, we will delete your Personal Data from our systems.</p>

            <p>The period for which we keep your Personal Information that is necessary for compliance and legal enforcement purposes varies and depend on the nature of our legal obligations and claims in the individual case.</p>

            <p>How We Protect the Security of Your Personal Information</p>

            <p>We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to safeguard your Personal Information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access Personal Information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your Personal Information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your Personal Information.</p>

            <p>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</p>

            <p>We may modify or revise our privacy policy from time to time. Although we may attempt to notify you when major changes are made to this privacy policy, you are expected to periodically review the most up-to-date version found at so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you.</p>

You agree that you will periodically review this privacy policy and refresh the page when doing so. You agree to note the date of the last revision to our privacy policy. If the &ldquo;last modified&rdquo; date is unchanged from the last time you reviewed our privacy policy, then it is unchanged. On the other hand, if the date has changed, then there have been changes, and you agree to re-review our privacy policy, and you agree to the new ones.
