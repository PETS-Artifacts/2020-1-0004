<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we treat your personal information.</p>
<h3>(1)	What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>

<li>any other information that you choose to send us.</li>
</ol>
<h3>(2)	Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
<p>We may use both &quot;session&quot; cookies and &quot;persistent&quot; cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>
We may use third party web services to analyse the use of our website. Such services generate statistical and other
information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated
relating to our website is used for creating reports about the use of the website.<sup>1</sup>

We may display third party advertisements on our website.<sup>2</sup>
Our advertisers may also use technologies such as cookies or web beacons to track your use of this website and other websites
in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.<sup>3</sup>
