<div class='scrollable'><h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our website visitors; this policy sets out how we treat your personal information.</p>
<h3>(1)	What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal data:</p>
<ol>
<li>information about your computer and about your visits to and use of this website (including your IP address, geographical location, browser type, referral source, length of visit and number of page views);</li>
<li>information related to any transactions carried out between you and us on this website or in relation to it, including information related to any purchases of our goods or services;</li>
<li>information that you provide us with when registering with us (including your full name, your email address and your climbing preferences); and</li>
<li>any other information that you choose to send us.</li>
</ol>
<h3>(2)	Cookies</h3>
<p>A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.</p>
<p>We may use both &quot;session&quot; cookies and &quot;persistent&quot; cookies on the website. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.</p>
<p>
We may use third party web services to analyse the use of our website. Such services generate statistical and other
information about website use by means of cookies, which are stored on users' computers. The information generated
relating to our website is used for creating reports about the use of the website.<sup>1</sup>
</p>
<p>
We may display third party advertisements on our website.<sup>2</sup>
Our advertisers may also use technologies such as cookies or web beacons to track your use of this website and other websites
in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept cookies. This will, however, have a negative effect on the usability of many websites. On our website cookies are required in order to be able to log in.</p>
<h3>(3)	Using your personal data</h3>
<p>Personal data submitted on this website will be used for the purposes specified in this privacy policy or in relevant parts of the website.</p>

<li>provide third parties with statistical information about our users – but this information will not be used to identify any individual user;</li>
<li>deal with enquiries and complaints made by or about you relating to the website.</li>

<p>Apart from the ways specified in this privacy policy, we will not provide your information to third parties.</p>
<h3>(5)	The security of your personal data</h3>
<p>We will take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.</p>
<p>
We may store all the personal information you provide on servers or other technology provided by
third party vendors or trusted hosting partners.<sup>4</sup>
