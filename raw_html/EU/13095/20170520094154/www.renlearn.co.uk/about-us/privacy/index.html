<h4>Do Not Track</h4>
<p>Certain browsers have settings that allow you to turn on a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature. The Website supports DNT by stopping the collection of information that allows us to tailor content based on your recent visits to the Website and third parties (e.g., Partner) websites. When you enable DNT on your browser, we stop the collection of unique browser cookies that links your browser to visits to this Website and across other websites. If you enable DNT on your browser, however, certain features of the Website may not function properly. </p>
<p>We may from time to time use third-party service providers to track and analyse usage of the Website.

<h4>Cookies</h4>
<p>Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s storage device for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes: First, we utilise persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Website. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Website, to better understand how you interact with the Website and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Website. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Website and then close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Website may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Website. </p>
<h4>Web Beacons</h4>
<p>We also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “<strong>Web Beacons</strong>”) on our Website. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Website, to deliver branded services, and to generate statistics about how our Website is used. </p>
<h4>Email Lists</h4>
<p>Renaissance maintains email lists to keep interested parties informed about our company, events, products, support, and more. We do not sell the addresses on our list, but we may make information available to specific business partners, sponsors, or service providers. </p>

<p>EU Individuals have the right to access their personal information.  Upon request, Renaissance will grant individuals access to personal information that it holds about them provided there is no information about third parties.  In such cases, Renaissance will redact such third party information. </p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Your personally identifiable information will generally be stored in databases maintained by Renaissance or our service providers. Most of these databases are stored on servers located in the United States. Renaissance may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to store your personally identifiable information, some of which may be outside of the United States. </p>
<p>We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and administrative steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your personally identifiable information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your Website account information. </p>
<h4>International Transfer</h4>
<p>If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Renaissance transfers information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer. </p>
<h4>EU &#8211; U.S. Privacy Shield</h4>
<p>Renaissance participates in and complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (the “Framework”).  Renaissance has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice; Choice; Accountability for Onward Transfer; Security; Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation; Access; and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

To learn more about the Privacy Shield Framework, visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.  To view our certification, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield List.   </p>
<p>Renaissance is responsible for the processing of personal data it received, under the Framework.  For personal data transferred from the EU, if Renaissance transfers your personal data to a third party, Renaissance will ensure that the third party is contractually obligated to process your data only for limited, specific purposes consistent with this Policy.  Renaissance will also ensure that the third party will apply the same level of protection to that data as the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Principles and will notify us if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet this obligation.  Renaissance also complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for the onward transfer liability provisions. </p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Framework, Renaissance is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Renaissance may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. </p>

<h2>Application Privacy Policy</h2>
<h4>Effective Date: September 15, 2016</h4>
<p>This Application Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is by and between Renaissance Learning, UK Ltd. (“Renaissance” “us” or “we”) and Schools licensed to use Renaissance Applications.  If you are not a School or an Authorised User (such as a student or parent to whom a School grants access), you are not allowed to use the Applications.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use the Applications.   </p>
<p><strong>Updates</strong>. Renaissance may revise this Policy from time to time and will make an updated version of this Policy available on a publicly accessible location. Subject to the foregoing, Renaissance will not make material changes to this Policy without first providing prominent notice to the educational institution and allowing them choices before data is used in any manner inconsistent with terms they were initially provided; and not make material changes to other policies or practices governing the use of Personally Identifiable Information that are inconsistent with contractual requirements. </p>
<p><strong>School Control</strong>. The collection, input, use, retention, disposal, and disclosure of any Personally Identifiable Information submitted via the Applications are controlled by the School.  Renaissance will not delete, change, or share any information from the Applications except as provided in this Policy unless we have a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: conform to legal requirements or to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or to enforce our contractual obligations.  Renaissance also collects non-personally identifiable information, including aggregate data as described in this Policy. </p>

<p><strong>Parental Inquiries</strong>. Renaissance will direct all requests to review and/or correct erroneous information to the School. The Applications generally have functionality which allows School personnel to correct or modify records without any intervention by Renaissance.

<p><strong>Privacy Shield Inquiries</strong>.

<p><strong>Privacy Shield Dispute Resolution</strong>.  If you are a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield and you have not received timely response to your concern from our U.S. Parent Company, or they have not addressed your concern to your satisfaction, you may seek further assistance, at no cost to you, from <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">JAMS</a>, which is an independent dispute resolution body in the United States. </p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield Related Arbitration</strong>. You may also be able to invoke binding arbitration for unresolved complaints but prior to initiating such arbitration, a resident of a European country participating in the Privacy Shield must first: (1) contact our U.S. Parent Company  and afford them the opportunity to resolve the issue; (2) seek assistance from <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/" target="_blank">JAMS</a>; and (3) contact the U.S. Department of Commerce (either directly or through a European Data Protection Authority) and afford the Department of Commerce time to attempt to resolve the issue. If such a resident invokes binding arbitration, each party shall be responsible for its own attorney’s fees. Please be advised that, pursuant to the Privacy Shield, the arbitrator(s) may only impose individual-specific, non-monetary, equitable relief necessary to remedy any violation of the Privacy Shield Principles with respect to the resident. </p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield U.S. Federal Trade Commission Enforcement</strong>.  Our U.S. Parent Company’s Privacy Shield compliance is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC). </p>
<p><strong>Privacy Shield Right of Access</strong>.  Some non-US users (including those whose personal data is within the scope of the Privacy Shield certification) have certain legal rights to access certain personal data we hold about them and to obtain its correction, amendment or deletion. Those users may exercise some of those rights through the options described in our Privacy Policy. But please be advised that because our personnel have a limited ability to identify and access an individual user’s personal data that a school has submitted to our Services, if you wish to request access, to limit use, or to limit disclosure, we may first refer your request to the school who submitted your personal data, and we will support them as needed in responding to your request. </p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>. Renaissance agrees to develop, implement, maintain and use commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures to preserve the confidentiality, integrity and availability of all data stored, managed, retained, accessed or used via the Applications.   </p>
<ul>
<li>Renaissance will notify the School of any unauthorised release of Personally Identifiable Information that it becomes aware of within a reasonable amount of time and in accordance with applicable laws.  The School agrees to provide the adult students and parents of the School’s minor students with direct notice of any such security breach as required by law. Except to the extent required by law, Renaissance will not communicate directly with adult students and parents of Schools’ minor students except as directed in writing by the School.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Data Retention</strong>. Personally Identifiable Information in student records is removed from the Applications after the School terminates its subscription to the Applications and, if requested in writing by the School, is returned to the School in a standard file format.  Anonymous and aggregated data that does not include Personally Identifiable Information may remain on Renaissance’s systems and Renaissance may continue to use that information. </p>
<p><strong>Third-Party Services</strong>. The Applications may operate with third-party software and services obtained separately by the School or Authorised Users (“Third Party Services”), (for example document management systems, third-party websites, etc.).  While Renaissance may configure its Applications to operate with third-party services, Renaissance does not endorse, and is not responsible for the privacy policies, operation, or functionality of third-party services. </p>
<p><strong>Recourse</strong>. Renaissance and Renaissance’s U.S. Parent Company set out three requirements for effective enforcement: (i) recourse for individuals to whom the data relate; (ii) follow up procedures for verifying that the attestations and assertions they have made about their privacy practices are true; and (iii) obligations to remedy problems arising out of failure to comply with the Principles and consequences for such organizations. </p>
