<h3 class="title">Learn more: Important Information</h3>

<div class="hide">
<p>This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services. There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:</p>

<h3><strong>When you share your personal information on our sites or applications - what happens? </strong></h3>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other users can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the sellers and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.</p>

<p>Your username is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other users about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users&#39; contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.</p>

<h3><strong>How you should use the information you receive on eBay</strong></h3>

<p>When you are in a transaction with another user, we enable you to obtain or we may provide you with the personal information of the other user (such as his/her name, account ID, email address, contact details, shipping and billing address) to complete the transaction. We encourage you to inform the other user about your privacy practices and respect his/her privacy. In all cases, you must give the other user a chance to remove himself/herself from your database and give him/her a chance to review what information you have collected about them.</p>

<p>You may use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, or for other services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, fraud complaints, and member-to-member communications), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information of other users that you have access to for any other purpose constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Unwanted or threatening email</strong></h3>

<p>We do not tolerate abuse of our Services. You do not have permission to add other users to your mailing list (email or postal), call, or send him/her text messages for commercial purposes, even if this user purchased something from you, unless the user has given his/her explicit consent. Sending unwanted or threatening email and text messages is against our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> or <a href="mailto:spoof@ebay.com">spoof@ebay.com</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Children&#39;s Privacy</strong></h3>

<p>Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.</p>

<h3><strong>Third Party Privacy Practices</strong></h3>

<p>This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, or if you are directed to a third party website, their privacy notices and practices will apply.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.</p>

The effect of an opt-out will be to stop targeted advertising, but it will still allow the collection of usage data for certain purposes (e.g., research, analytics and internal online services operation purposes).</p>

<p>If you withdraw your consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information for the other purposes set out in this Privacy Notice you may not have access to our all our Services and we might not be able to provide you all of the Services and customer support offered to our users and authorized under this Privacy Notice and our User Agreement.</p>

<h3><strong class="boldTxt">Access</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to your account. Please update your personal information immediately if it changes or is inaccurate</li>
	<li>Once you make a public posting, you may not be able to change or remove it. Upon your request, we will close your account and remove your personal information from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with applicable law</li>
	<li>We will honor any statutory right you might have to access, modify or erase your personal information. You can use the Contact Us to request access and find out whether any fees may apply, as permitted by law. Where you have a legal right to request access or request the correction of information, we can still withhold that access or decline to correct information in some cases in accordance with applicable law, but will give you reasons if we do so.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong class="boldTxt">Disclosure</strong></h3>

<p>There are times when we disclose your personal information to members of the eBay Inc. corporate family or other third parties. This disclosure may be required for us to operate or provide you access to our Services, comply with our legal obligations, enforce our policies, facilitate our advertising, or reduce or prevent fraud related to our Services.

<p>We minimize the amount of personal information we share to what is directly relevant and necessary to accomplish the specified purpose. As stated above, we do not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing and advertising purposes without your explicit consent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Members of our corporate family will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have consented to receive such communications from them.</p>

<p>If we were to merge with or be acquired by another company, we may share information with them in accordance with our Global Privacy Standards. Should such an event occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this Privacy Notice with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used or disclosed for any purposes not covered in this Privacy Notice, you will receive prior notification of the use of your personal information for the new purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers and Financial Institutions Partners</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Third party service providers who help us operate our Services, and assist with fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs, co-branded credit cards and other business operations</li>
	<li>financial institution partners who may offer financial products to our users (such as WebBank and Comenity Capital Bank with whom we partner to provide PayPal Credit, a PayPal Service) to provide joint content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts, violations of our policies, fraud and/or security breaches, and to guide decisions about their products, websites, applications, services, tools, and communications. These third party financial institution partners will use this information to send you marketing communications only if you have requested their services</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Law enforcement, legal proceedings, and as authorized by law</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>to comply with our legal requirements, enforce our policies, respond to claims that a listing or other content violates the rights of others, or protect anyone&#39;s rights, property or safety</li>
	<li>to law enforcement or governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged or suspected illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other eBay user to legal liability. We will only disclose information we deem relevant to the investigation or inquiry,such as name, city, state, postcode, telephone number, email address, User ID history, IP address, fraud complaints, bidding and listing history, and anything else we deem relevant</li>
	<li>to eBay VeRO Program participants under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion deem necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. In such events, we will disclose name, street address, city, state, postcode, country, phone number, email address and company name</li>
	<li>to credit bureaus as authorized by applicable law (e.g. information on late or missed payments or other defaults on your account that may be reflected in your credit report)</li>
	<li>to third parties involved in a legal proceeding, if they provide us with a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, or we otherwise believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People you authorize us to provide it to</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>eBay users as authorized by you or your use of our Services (e.g. if you buy an item the seller may view your email address and request and obtain your contact information, including phone number or email and postal address to help complete the transaction)</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong class="boldTxt">Security</strong></h3>

<p>We protect your information using technical and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure and alteration. Some of the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access controls to our data centers, and information access authorization controls.</p>

<h3><strong class="boldTxt">Important Information</strong></h3>

<p>This section describes some additional important information related to your use of our Services. Please review it for more details.</p>

<p>There are just a few more pieces of important privacy information related to your use of our Services that we need to cover:</p>

<p><strong>When you share your personal information on eBay - what happens? </strong></p>

<p>Other users have access to the information you share on eBay. For example, other people can see your bids, purchases, items for sale, your collections, the members and collections you follow, storefronts, Feedback, ratings and associated comments. Other users can also see any information you chose to share in your profile or your collections.</p>

<p>Your User ID is displayed throughout eBay and is available to the public. It is connected to all of your eBay activity. Notices sent to other community members about suspicious activity and notice violations on our sites refer to User IDs and specific items. So if you associate your name with your User ID, the people to whom you have revealed your name will be able to personally identify your eBay activities.</p>

<p>To help protect your privacy, we allow only limited access to other users&#39; contact, shipping and financial information as necessary to facilitate your transactions and collect payments. However, when users are involved in a transaction, they have access to each other&#39;s name, User ID, email address and other contact and shipping information.</p>

<p><strong>How you should use the information you receive on eBay</strong></p>

<p>eBay enables you to obtain personal information of others to complete transactions and collect payments. We encourage you to disclose your privacy practices and respect the privacy of other users. In all cases, you must give other users a chance to remove themselves from your database and a chance to review what information you have collected about them</p>

<p>Use the personal information that you have access to only for eBay transaction-related purposes, for using services offered through eBay (such as escrow, shipping, and fraud complaints), and for purposes expressly consented by the user to whom the information relates. Using personal information that you have access to for any other purpose is a violation of our policies.</p>

<p><strong>Unwanted or threatening email</strong></p>

<p>Sending unwanted or threatening email is against our <a href="/help/account/protecting-account/recognising-spoof-emails?id=4195">policies</a>&nbsp;and constitutes a violation of our <a href="/help/policies/member-behaviour-policies/user-agreement?id=4259">User Agreement</a>. To report eBay-related spam or spoof emails please forward the email to <a href="mailto:spam@ebay.com">spam@ebay.com</a> or <a href="mailto:spoof@ebay.com">spoof@ebay.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Children&#39;s Privacy</strong></p>

<p>Our websites are general audience websites, and our Services are not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users in this age group.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Privacy Practices</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Notice addresses only the use and disclosure of personal information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, their privacy notices and practices will apply.</p>

<p>We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of your information once you provide it to a third party and we encourage you to evaluate the privacy and security policies of your trading partner before entering into a transaction and choosing to share your information. This is true even where the third parties to whom you disclose personal information are bidders, buyers or sellers on our sites.</p>

<h3><strong class="boldTxt">Questions or Complaints</strong></h3>

<p>If you have a question or a complaint about this Privacy Notice or our global privacy or information handling practices, you can reach our Global Privacy Office in writing by sending us a letter or postcard to: eBay Inc, Attn: Legal - Global Privacy Office, 2145 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125 USA or using the <a href="http://contact.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ContactUsNextGen&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;&amp;&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;domain=Help&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;&amp;&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;query=Privacy%20policy&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;&amp;&lt;!--iqsc--&gt;from=1003146" target="_blank">Contact Us<span class="g-hdn"> - opens in new window or tab</span></a> form for your individual site.</p>
