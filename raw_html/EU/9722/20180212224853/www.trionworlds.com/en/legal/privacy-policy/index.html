<h3 id="personalinfo">WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>
<h3>A. GENERAL</h3>
<p>Personal information is information that directly or indirectly identifies a particular individual, such as your name (first and surname together), email address, postal address and/or phone number (“<strong>Personal Information</strong>”). Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional Personal Information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date and shipping and billing addresses. With the exception of certain technical information later described, we do not collect any Personal Information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily (e.g. through interaction or registration with the Sites).</p>
<p>If you decide to provide us your Personal Information, it will generally be for: (1) account or product registration, or registration for online game participation; (2) the purchase of goods or services through our online store (including the purchase of in-game digital items (“<strong>Virtual Items</strong>”)); (3) message boards or forums; (4) newsletters; (5) e-cards or Send to a Friend promotions; (6) sweepstakes or contest registrations or surveys; (7) customer service or technical support; (8) consumer complaint(s); and (9) social media interaction.</p>
<p>We will only collect the Personal Information which is needed to fulfill your requests and/or our legitimate business objectives, as set out in this Privacy Policy, and we will keep it no longer than is necessary to fulfill such purposes and objectives. If you refuse to divulge your Personal Information when requested, and the disclosure of such Personal Information is indicated as being required (rather than voluntary), you will not be able to access certain functionality or areas of the Site (such as chat rooms and message boards).</p>

<h3>B. ACCOUNT OR PRODUCT REGISTRATION AND ONLINE GAME PARTICIPATION</h3>
<p>Trion provides certain content, online games (each a “<strong>Game</strong>”) and/or services through the Site. Some areas of the Site may allow you to visit as a guest and remain anonymous, but you may not be able to access all the content and features of those areas without registering an account with us (e.g. in order to play our Games or purchase Game-related Virtual Items). Additional information, such as your real name and billing information, will be required (an “<strong>Account</strong>”) in order to access advanced features. Important information regarding Account registration procedures and the security of your Account is set out in our <a href="https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/)</a>.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>
<h3>C. ONLINE GAMES</h3>
<p>When you play any of the Games offered and/or served by Trion, or use any of the communication features on the Site, your Internet Protocol address (the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider) (your “<strong>IP Address</strong>”) from which you access any of the above may be stored in our records. Trion may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, Site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused.</p>
<p>When any Game is updated or “<strong>patched</strong>,” our patch routine may check your computer to see that you have the most recent version of Game-specific files; when you communicate within any Game or any other communication feature within the Sites (e.g. live chat, instant message services and the like), even “<strong>privately</strong>” to another person, you do so with the understanding that those communications go through our servers. You expressly agree to waive any rights of confidentiality that you may have in and to your communications (if any) when using any of the Sites’ communication features, you agree you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications; and, accordingly, where and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you expressly consent to monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer service communications) that you send and receive. When you log in to one of our Games, your system specifications (such as OS, RAM, video card, monitor, system configuration, crash data, diagnostic data, etc.) may be reviewed/recorded by us for the purposes of analyzing and optimizing your Game experience and in order to provide you with customer service.</p>

<h3>F. NEWSLETTERS AND SEND TO A FRIEND PROMOTIONS</h3>
<p>Typically you need to have an Account in order to receive emails from us, provided that you may receive email communications from us on a one-time basis if you have contacted us directly with regard to a specific request or for email newsletters. You can opt-out of receiving future marketing emails from us by following the directions contained in the email to “unsubscribe.”</p>
<p>Notwithstanding your email preferences, from time to time, Trion may send a transactional or relationship message which provides information concerning a transaction you have agreed to, your membership, subscription or account and/or warranty or safety information.</p>
<p>Also, except in jurisdictions where it may be prohibited by law to do so, the Site or service offerings available thereon may allow you to submit information about other people. For example, we may offer “Send to a Friend” promotions, like electronic postcards available on the Site or through our newsletters. In these situations, you may provide the email address and, sometimes, the name of a friend. After the “Send to a Friend” transaction is completed, that information is deleted. We will not retain the recipient’s email address for longer than necessary to complete the transmission. In our communication to your friend in this circumstance, he or she will only receive further information from us if he or she has affirmatively opted-in to receive future emails from us.</p>

<h3>INDIRECT COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="nonpersonalinfo">WHAT NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU</h3>
<p>General, aggregated, demographic, and non-Personal Information may be collected by Trion. This type of anonymous, aggregated profiling and session data includes information that you have provided to us through surveys, polls, etc., and is combined with your IP address.</p>
<p>As part of the registration process for some services, you will be asked to provide information that does not personally identify you. For example, you will be asked to provide information concerning your date of birth, country, entertainment preferences, purchasing habits, and the like. This information is generally optional, but where provided it will be included in your Account profile and you hereby consent to this information being tied to your Personal Information. Trion requests this information to understand you better and to also bring to your attention new services, programs, or offers that may be of interest to you. Where Trion automatically collects non-Personal Information as stated above, and it is possible to link this information to your Personal Information, you hereby consent to Trion linking relevant non-Personal information to your Personal Information.</p>
<p>In many cases, Trion will automatically collect certain non-Personal Information about your use of the Sites. Trion might collect, among other things, information concerning the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using, the domain name of your Internet Service Provider, your “click path” through the Sites, and the website or advertisement that was linked to or from the Site when you visited. To do this, Trion may use cookies and other technology (see next section). In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to Trion. Trion may use this information to generate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our affiliates. Trion may also use such information for security, system integrity (e.g. the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.) or enforcement purposes. Please note that, your visits to the Sites, and information provided through these technologies, will be connected to your IP address and are therefore not anonymous.</p>
<p><a class="right" href="#header">Back to top</a></p>
<div class="clear"></div>
<h3 id="cookies">INFORMATION ON COOKIES AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY</h3>
<p>COOKIES</p>
<p>The Sites, and some services and advertisements displayed or made available thereon, may contain “<strong>cookies</strong>.” Cookies are a feature of your web browser which allow websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for recordkeeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to “<strong>remember</strong>” things such as your password or that you have already registered an Account. This enables us to accelerate your future activities, saving the time that you would otherwise spend entering information such as your username or password.</p>
<p>Trion (itself or through a third party service) also employs a software technology called clear GIFs (also known as “<strong>web beacons</strong>”) that helps us better manage content on our Sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on Site pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. These clear gifs are tied to unique identifiers such as your IP address. Technology and tools such as clear GIFs assist in the delivery of cookies.</p>
<p>Our third party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track information about visitors to our Sites in the aggregate. They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our Sites. We have no access to or control of these third-party tracking utilities.  Upon request, Trion will provide a non-exhaustive list of these third party service providers. If you wish to opt out this third party data collection, you must opt out of Trion’s services.</p>
<p>We also use clear GIFs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear GIFs are tied to Personal Information.</p>
<p>Cookies can either be permanent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser). Certain cookies are required to allow or facilitate electronic communications or are necessary to allow the provision of online services at the request of the user. Personal Information, such as unique identifiers (i.e. IP address), collected through the use of these technologies will be collected, stored and processed according to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Trion (itself or through a third party service) uses cookies, clear GIFs, frames, server log analysis and other technology to:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable you to move around the Sites and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Sites;</li>
<li>collect information about how you use our Sites, estimate our audience size and usage patterns, and improve how our Sites work;</li>
<li>store information about your preferences, so as to allow us to customize your experience with the Sites and its subsites;</li>
<li>to speed up your searches;</li>
<li>recognize you when you return to our Sites;</li>
<li>retrieve information for promotional, marketing or security purposes; and</li>
<li>collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>By using our Sites, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device and use clear GIFs.</p>
<p>Most Internet browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. You should refer to your browser instructions or “Help” screen to learn more about how to manage cookies. Please note, however, that if you block cookies, some portions of the Sites may not function properly.</p>
<p>CONSENT TO MONITOR</p>
<p>Please note that, when running, some Games may monitor your computer’s random access memory (“<strong>RAM</strong>”), media access control (“<strong>MAC</strong>”) address, configuration files and system files, etc., for unauthorized third party programs running concurrently with your Game which, in Trion ‘s sole determination: (i) enable or facilitate cheating of any type; (ii) allow users to modify or hack the applicable Game interface, environment, and/or experience in any way not expressly authorized by Trion; or (iii) intercept, “<strong>mine</strong>” or otherwise collect information from or through the applicable Game (an “<strong>Unauthorized Third Party Program</strong>”). In the event that a Game detects an Unauthorized Third Party Program, (a) the Game may communicate information back to Trion, including without limitation your Account username, details about the Unauthorized Third Party Program detected and the activities or functions performed thereby, and/or details about your computer, and/or (b) Trion may exercise any or all of its rights and remedies under the Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/) or the applicable Game EULA without prior notice to the user linked to such Unauthorized Third Party Program.</p>
<p>You acknowledge that any and all data that is stored and is resident on our servers, and any and all communications that you make within the Sites or any Games (including, but not limited to, messages solely directed at another player or group of players) traverse through our servers, may or may not be monitored by us or our agents (to the extent permitted by applicable law), you have no expectation of privacy in any such communications and expressly consent to such monitoring of communications you send and receive. You expressly agree to waive any rights of confidentiality that you may have in and to your communications (if any) when using any of the Sites’ communication features, you agree you have no expectation of privacy in any of those communications and, accordingly, and you expressly consent to such monitoring of communications (including technical support and customer service communications) that you send and receive.</p>

<p>When you have provided Personal Information to us for a particular purpose, we may disclose your information to other companies that we have engaged to assist us in fulfilling your request and who we subject to confidentiality requirements. This may include, but is not limited to, fulfillment houses, billing services, payment gateway services, transaction managers, credit verification servicesand other third party service providers.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>
<p>We will also provide your Personal Information to third party processors so that it can be administered and processed for the purposes notified to you in the Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use and Contractual Agreement (https://www.trionworlds.com/en/legal/terms-of-use/) and we may also share details with third parties (such as auditors or legal advisors) in order to obtain professional advice. Any such processing will be governed by an agreement in the form required by applicable laws, preserving any and all of your statutory data protection rights.</p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we will not give any of your Personal Information to any third party without your express approval, and the only Personal Information we will request to share with third parties is your name, mailing address and email address.

However, if you do not provide consent then you may be unable to participate in the applicable co-published Game. As described in the registration process, a third party’s use of the shared Personal Information will be governed by its privacy policy and Trion’s use of such information shall, of course, be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3 id="secure">SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED</h3>
<p>Trion has made an effort to ensure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form (i.e. free from any alteration). As such, access to all Personal Information is strictly controlled by limiting access to Personal Information to employees performing a legitimate business function. When payment information is transmitted, for example, Trion employs an industry standard security technology known as a secure-socket-layer (“SSL”) encryption. Unless otherwise specified herein or on the Site where you make a purchase, credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any data will provide sufficient protection of Personal Information.</p>
<p>While Trion takes reasonable precautions against possible breaches of the Site and customer databases, no website or Internet transmission is completely secure. Consequently, Trion cannot and does not guarantee that unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur, but we have in place reasonable technical and organizational security measures to protect your Personal Information against accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or against unauthorized disclosure or access to the Personal Information we collect online. We will notify users of a data breach involving unencrypted Personal Information by email and/or by posting a notice to the affected Site(s).</p>
<p>Trion urges you to take steps to keep your Personal Information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your Account information), logging out of your user Account and closing your web browser when you are finished using the Sites.</p>
