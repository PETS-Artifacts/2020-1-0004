Acquisition, Processing and Utilization of Person-Specific Data</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Person-specific data describes details relating to the actual or personal relationships of a specific or identifiable natural person. Such details include, for example, your name, your telephone number, your address, and all existing data that you disclose to us during registration and when opening your customer account.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.1 Customer Account</strong>
For each customer who registers with us via the "jetzt registrieren" [register now] function, we set up a customer account, i.e. password-protected, direct access to his or her existing data stored by us. This allows you, amongst other things, to view your already-concluded, still open and recently sent orders, or to manage your personal data and the newsletter.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.1.1 Setup of the Customer Account</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">The following data must be given during the registration for a customer account (obligatory disclosures):</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– your e-mail address</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– your password</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– your forename</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– your surname</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– your gender</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">– consent to the check on credit standing and to the data-protection provisions</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Your invoice and delivery address need not be given until you order something. For your order we need your correct name, address and payment data. We need your e-mail address so that we can confirm receipt of your order and its dispatch, and so that we can communicate with you in general. We also use your e-mail address to identify you (as a log-in name), when you visit your customer account.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.1.2.

You can also use the customer account to log-in to the offer of the Zalando Lounge (also an offer of Zalando SE) or to the other services of the Zalando business group (e.g. Zalon, Fleek or MOVMNT). We will only pass on your data to these services if you log in there. If the services are not those of Zalando SE (e.g. the Zalando Lounge), the passing on of data will even then only take place with your consent, which you can give during the respective log-in process.If you do not log out of your customer account, you will automatically remain logged in. This function enables you to use part of our services (e.g. My Wish List) even without having to log-in to the customer account again. For security reasons, however, you are asked to give your password again if, for example, your personal data is to be altered or if you would like to place an order.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.1.3.

To this end you have the so-called function "My Preferences” available; and you can return to and adjust the details you have given in your customer account at any time. With the help of your details we are able to personalize, amongst other things, your start page, to make our service still more relevant and more interesting for you.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.2 Acquisition, Processing and Utilization of Your Person-Specific Data</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">We collect, store and process your data for the entire processing of your purchase, including any subsequent guarantee claims, for our services (for example: “My Preferences”), the technical administration, our own marketing purposes (more information on these under point 2.3) and to prevent criminal offences and fraud.

When processing orders, for example, the service companies used by us (transport companies, logistics companies, banks) are sent the data they require for processing and concluding orders. The data passed on to our service providers in this context may only be used by them for fulfilling their duties.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.3 Use of Your Data for Advertising Purposes</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Apart from the processing of your data for settlement of your purchase at Zalando, we also use your data for the following purposes: to permanently improve your purchase experience and for making this more customer-friendly and individual for you; to communicate with you about your orders, and about certain products or marketing campaigns; and to recommend products or services that might interest you.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">To this end we use the information available, such as confirmations of receipts and reading confirmation of e- mails, information on the terminal device used by you, your connection to the Internet, operating system and platform, date and time of the visit to the home page, or products that you have looked at, as well as information that we have received from you (including automatically transferred or generated information).

These are advertisements which we also use on third sites. It usually involves the use of so-called cookies or pixels. Our aim here is to make the advertising offers more useful and more interesting for you, which is why you will see, in the context of the banner ads, mainly products that you have either already looked at on our site or products that are similar to those already looked at by you (so-called re-targeting). Within the framework of the banner ads we work solely with pseudonymous data; clear-text information relating to your person (e.g. your name or your e-mail address) is not used in the cookies.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">You can find more information on cookies, pixels and re-targeting under point 4 and point 7 of this policy statement.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">2.3.4 Prize Draws, Market Research and Opinion Polling</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">For prize draws we make use of your data for win notifications and for advertising our offers.

Cookies</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">The acceptance of cookies is not a prerequisite for access to our websites. We draw your attention, however, to the fact that our website and service has only limited functionality, if you do not allow us to place cookies.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">What are cookies?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Cookies are small files that are stored on your data carrier and hold certain settings and data for exchange with our system via your browser. Basically speaking there are 2 different types of cookies: the so-called session cookies, that are deleted as soon as you close your browser; and temporary/permanent cookies, that are stored on your data carriers for a longer period or without limit. This type of storage helps us to design our websites and our offers for you and makes it easier for you to use them in that, for example, certain input from you can be stored so that you are not required to enter this repeatedly.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">Which cookies are used by Zalando?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Most of the cookies used by us are automatically deleted from your hard disk at the end of the browser session (hence the term "session cookies"). Session cookies are needed, for example, to make the shopping-basket function available to you over several pages. In addition to these we also make use of cookies that remain on your hard disk. On a subsequent visit it is then automatically recognized that you have previously visited us, and we know which input and settings you prefer. These temporary or even permanent cookies (lifespan of 1 month to 10 years) are stored on your hard disk and are automatically deleted after the pre-specified period. These cookies in particular serve to make our offer more user-friendly, more effective and more secure. Thanks to these files it is possible, for example, that the site shows you information that has been specially selected to match your interests. The sole purpose of these cookies is to adapt our offer to your customer wishes as well as possible and to make surfing with us as comfortable as possible for you.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">What data is stored in the cookies?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">In the cookies used by Zalando, only pseudonymous data is stored. On activation of the cookie this is allocated an identification number; an allocation of your person-specific data to this identification number is not undertaken. Your name, your IP address and other such data that might allow the cookie to be traced to you directly are not placed in the cookie. On the basis of the cookie technology we receive only pseudonymized information, relating for example to which of our shop pages have been visited, which products were viewed, etc.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">What is on-site targeting?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">On the Zalando websites data is collected on the basis of a cookie technology for optimization of our advertising and of the entire online offer. This data is not used to identify you personally but solely serves the purpose of conducting a pseudonymous evaluation of the use made of the home page. With this technology we can present advertising and/or special offers and services to you, the content of which is based on information obtained from a connection to click-stream analysis (for example, advertising that is based on the fact that during the past few days only sports shoes have been viewed). Our aim here is to make our online offer as attractive for you as possible and to present to you advertising that corresponds to your areas of interest.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">Are there also cookies from third-party suppliers (so-called "third-party cookies")?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Zalando makes use of a number of web partners who help to make the Internet offer and the websites more interesting for you. This is why, when visiting the websites, the cookies of partner companies are also stored on your hard disk. These cookies are temporary/permanent cookies that are deleted automatically after the pre-specified period. These temporary or even permanent cookies (lifespan of 14 days to 10 years) are stored on your hard disk and delete themselves after the pre-specified period. The cookies of our partner companies also contain solely pseudonymous - mostly even anonymous - data. This relates, for example, to data on which products you have looked at, whether anything was bought, which products were searched for, etc. Here, some of our advertising partners also collect information from the websites on which pages you have previously visited or which products you were interested in, in order to be able to show you advertising that best complies with your interests.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">Re-Targeting</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">Our websites make use of so-called re-targeting technologies. We use these technologies to make the Internet offer more interesting for you. This technique allows Internet users who have already shown an interest in our shop and our products to also be provided with suitable advertising on the websites of our partners. We are convinced that the use of personalized, interest-oriented advertising is generally more interesting for the Internet users than advertising that has no such personal content. The use of this advertising approach by our partners is undertaken on the basis of a cookie technology and an analysis of previous utilization behaviour. This form of advertising is completely pseudonymous.On using our sites cookies are deployed and thereby usage data is collected from you, stored and utilized. Your data is furthermore stored in cookies beyond the end of the browser session so that it can, for example, be called up again on your next visits to the websites.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">How can you prevent the storage of cookies?</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">In your browser you can adopt the setting that storage of cookies is only permissible when you agree to it, and thereby prevent the further storage of cookies in the future. If you want to accept only the Zalando cookies but not the cookies of our service companies and partners, you can select the browser setting "Cookies von Drittanbietern blockieren" [Block third-party cookies].As a rule, the help function in the menu bar of your web browser will show you how to reject new cookies and how to inactivate old ones.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">4. Log Files</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">With each access to the pages of Zalando usage data is transmitted by the respective Internet browser and is stored in record files, the so-called server log files. The records stored in this way contain the following data: date and time of the call-up, name of the page called up, IP address, referrer URL (URL of origin, from which you came to the websites), the quantities of data transferred, product information and the version of the browser used.These log file data records are evaluated by us, to help us further improve our offer and the Zalando shop, as well as to make these more-user-friendly, to detect and correct errors more quickly and to control server capacities. At the same time we use the log-file data records to defend our Zalando shop against attacks, e.g. in the context of so-called distributed-denial-of-service attacks, which are intended to block access to our Zalando shop by overloading it with enquiries.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">5. Web Analysis</strong></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">In order to constantly improve and optimize our offer, we make use of so-called tracking technologies.

This data is used to continuously improve the Zalando shop and our offers and to optimize these and thereby make them more interesting for you. In the sphere of data protection, for the Web Controlling Software used by Zalando, Webtrekk GmbH has been certified by the technical supervisory authority TÜV Saarland. Hereby the recording and processing of tracking data in particular was checked and certified for conformity with data protection and for data security. In the context of utilization of these websites, information that your browser transmits is recorded and evaluated. This takes place by means of a cookie technology and so-called pixels, that are integrated in every website. The process records the following data: Request (name of the requested file), browser type/version, browser language, operating system used, internal resolution of the browser window, screen resolution, Java Script activation, Java on/off, cookies on/off, number of colours, URL referrer, IP address (is only collected anonymized and is deleted again directly after its use), time of access, clicks, order sum, shopping baskets and anonymized form contents (for example, whether a telephone number has been given or not). Direct person-specific tracing is at no time possible. The data gathered in this way serves in the preparation of anonymous user profiles that form the basis of web statistics. Without the separate consent of the person affected, the data collected with the help of Webtrekk technology is not used to identify the visitor to these websites personally and is at no time used together with the person-specific data on the bearer of the pseudonym.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">The data collection and data storage by Webtrekk can be refused at any time, with effect for the future.

California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA) on several pages only. This plug-in is normally deactivated and therefore sends no data. With a click on the plug-in, or more precisely on the icon "Social Media aktivieren" [Activate Social Media], you can activate the plug-in. The plug-ins can be deactivated again by clicking in the same place again.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">When this plug-in is activated, your browser makes a direct connection to the Facebook servers as soon as you call up a website containing this plug-in. The content of the plug-in is transmitted directly from Facebook to your browser and is integrated by this in the website.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text">With the activation of the plug-in Facebook is informed that you have called up the corresponding page of our Internet presentation.

With an active plug-in, with each call-up of the websites a cookie with an identification is set. Since your browser automatically sends this cookie to Facebook every time you connect with a network server, the network could in principle prepare a profile on which websites the user to whom the ID belongs has visited. And it would then indeed be possible to later trace this ID to a specific person - if you were later to register with the network, for example.</p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><br></p><p class="z-jarvis-rt-text"><strong class="z-jarvis-rt-bold">8.
