						We have prefixed each chapter with a short overview. This overview briefly summarises the content of the chapter. If you just want a quick high-level overview of all data processing, it is advisable to read the overviews. If you want to familiarise yourself with the details, you can click on “more” under the relevant overview. The full content of the chapter will then be displayed.
					</p>
					<p>
						We have avoided cross-references wherever possible. That way you get all information coherently explained, regardless of which chapter you are currently reading. If you read this Data Protection Declaration from start to finish, you may find that parts of the text are repeated. We were unable to avoid a few cross-references. For example, we summarised all country-specific data processing in a single chapter and always refer to this chapter when discussing country-specific data processing.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>Which services and offers this Data Protection Declaration applies to:</strong> Zalando processes your data in a similar way for most of our services. This Data Protection Declaration therefore applies to all benefits and services which we offer our European customers. This is true regardless of whether we do this via a website, an app, in transactions, on the phone, at events or via social networks or other channels. For ease of comprehension, we use the term “services” to summarise this “normal case”.
					</p>
					<p>
						There are, however, also exceptional services where we process your data differently or for particular purposes. This may be due to the nature of a service or country-specific requirements. When we are referring to these cases (that is “deviations from the normal case”), we call them “service-specific” or “country-specific”.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, you should also bear in mind that Zalando is not just a single company. Zalando is a group and thus consists of multiple companies. Not all of these companies offer you services or process your data. For simplicity, only the Zalando Group companies which are actually involved in processing your data are named below. Where we refer below to “Zalando”, “we” or “us”, we mean the responsible companies within Zalando Group which process your data.

					<h2 id="chapter-01" class="z-home-pp__chapterTitle">1. Which data does Zalando process?</h2>
					<p>
						Zalando offers you a wide range of services, which you can also use in a wide range of ways. Depending on whether you contact us online, by phone or otherwise and on which services you use, various data from different sources may come into play. Much of the data we process is provided by you yourself when you use our services or contact us, for example when you register and provide your name or email address or address. We do, however, also receive technical device and access data which is automatically collected when you interact with our services. This may, for example, be information on which device you are using. We collect further data using our own data analyses (e.g. within the framework of market research studies and customer evaluations). We may also receive data on you from third parties, for example for credit rating agencies and payment service providers.
					</p>
					<div class="z-home-pp__chapterHiddenContent" hidden>
						<p>
							When we talk about “your data”, we are referring to personal data. This includes all information which allows us to identify you straight away or by combining it with other information. Examples: Your name, your telephone number, your customer number, order numbers or your email address. All information which cannot be used to identify you (even by combining it with other data) is classified as non-personal data. Non-personal data is also referred to as anonymous data. If we combine your personal data with anonymous data, all the data in this record counts as personal data. If we delete the personal data from a piece of information or a record on your person, the remaining data in this record no longer counts as personal data. This procedure is referred to as anonymisation. The following generally applies: If we request that you share particular personal information with us, you may of course refuse to do this. You can decide which information you share with us. We may, however, be unable to provide you with the desired services (at least not optimally). For example, you cannot have a package delivered without giving a delivery address. If particular information is required in connection with a service (mandatory information), we will inform you by marking it accordingly.

							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.1 Profile information</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									Profile information is personal and demographic information on your person (so-called master data), along with your individual interests, which you share with us when registering for a customer account. Your profile data includes, for example:
								</p>
								<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
									<li>Your first and last names</li>
									<li>Your contact details</li>
									<li>Your preferences, e.g. in relation to brands, product types or styles</li>
									<li>Demographic information such as your gender, age and place of residence</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									Mandatory information is usually your name, your email address and a password you choose yourself. Your email address and the password will later constitute your login details.
								</p>
								<p>
									Other mandatory information may also be required for the use of access-restricted, fee-based or personalised services, such as your date of birth or your title (e.g. in order to transfer you to the relevant Zalando shop page for your gender) or your favourite brands and clothing styles.
								</p>
								<p>
									Profile data may also include further information on your person and your interests. These may be collected in the process of registering for the service, or only subsequently. This is the case, for example, if you later add voluntary information to your profile or you wish to use your customer account to register for a service which requires additional mandatory information.

									If you contact us, we collect your data. Depending on how you contact us (e.g. by phone or by email), your contact details may include your name, postal addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, detail on your social network profiles (for example we receive your Facebook ID if you contact us via Facebook), user names and similar contact details.

									If you order something from Zalando or shop on site, for example at a Zalando Outlet Store, we collect your shopping data. Depending on the type of purchase and processing status, shopping data may include the following information:
								</p>
								<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
									<li>Order number</li>
									<li>Details on the purchased items (name, size, colour, price etc.)</li>

							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.4 Payment details</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									We offer you the common payment methods in online retail - especially advance payment, credit card, PayPal or invoice. We collect the payment details shared by you in order to execute the payment. We receive further payment details from external payment service providers and credit agencies which we work with in executing payments and carrying out credit checks.  We only forward information to our payment service providers which is necessary for processing payment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Payment details include:
								</p>
								<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
									<li>Preferred payment method</li>
									<li>Billing addresses</li>
									<li>IBAN and BIC or account number and sort code</li>
									<li>Credit card details</li>
									<li>Creditworthiness data</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									The payment details also include other information directly connected to payment processing and credit checking. This applies, for example, to information which external payment service providers use for identification such as your PayPal ID (if you are paying with PayPal).
								</p>
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
									<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
										<p>
											Zalando Payments GmbH, Charlottenstr. 4, 10969 Berlin, Germany, is responsible for executing payments, managing claims and performing credit checks in connection with all private purchases from the Zalando shop and other fee-based services from Zalando Group.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									Creditworthiness data consists of our own records on your previous payment behaviour towards all Zalando Group companies and of score values which we collect on you from external credit agencies. Creditworthiness data makes statements on a person’s estimated capacity and willingness to pay. This helps companies to avoid defaults which result when customers cannot fulfil their payment obligations or cannot do so in good time. Taking creditworthiness data when choosing payment methods is also intended to prevent us offering our customers payment methods which cannot be offered to them and our customers entering into payment obligations which they cannot fulfil themselves. Creditworthiness data is normally collected from so-called credit agencies. The credit agencies then use various information to calculate a so-called score value which takes into account existing payment obligations and any previous defaults. Score values are statistically justified estimates of the future risk of a person defaulting and are represented as a numerical value, such as a percentage. We only have limited influence on processing of data by external credit agencies (e.g. if we provide credit agencies information on payment obligations which have not been fulfilled). 
								</p>
								<p>
									Cooperation with external payment service providers and credit agencies is on a country-specific basis, in order to take country-specific features and requirements into account. Under <a href="#chapter-14">Country-specific information</a> you can find information on which external payment service providers and credit agencies we work with in which countries. There you can also find special privacy policies which we provide you with on behalf of the relevant payment service providers and credit agencies.

						</div>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.5 Interests information</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									When you interact with our services, data arises which we use to find out which content, topics, products, product types, brands or styles you are interested in. For example, we can use shopping data, wish list content and your age (if this information is available to us) and comparison with users with similar features to find out which styles and product categories you are interested in. Thus, we can show the products which will probably be most relevant to you first the next time you perform a search.
								</p>
								<p>
									Along with the interests you have directly shared with us, we can also derive your interests from other data we have collected. If, for example, you repeatedly visit a particular area of the Zalando shop, we can extrapolate your interests from your access data by means of usage analysis (e.g. we can deduce that you might be interested in sport if you frequently visit the category “sportswear” or order products from this category).
								</p>
								<p>
									For this purpose, we also receive demographic information and statistics on our users from our external advertising partners (such as age, gender, region), as well as device and access data and interests. We take care that our advertising partners only provide Zalando with aggregate, encrypted and anonymous data, so that we cannot assign the data to any particular person, especially any particular user. This information may help us to understand our users better, perhaps within the framework of customer structure analyses and user segmentation.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can find further information on the processing of your data for advertising purposes under <a href="#chapter-08">“How does Zalando use my data for marketing?”</a>.

						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.6 Messages, conversation content</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									If you communicate with us or other users regarding products (e.g. product evaluations) and other topics by phone, post, social media, contact forms or any other medium, we collect the content of your messages.
								</p>
								<p>
									We may forward your messages to the office responsible for your concerns, perhaps to partner companies or manufacturers. If your messages are forwarded to another company (e.g. if you provide us with feedback on the manufacturer of a product), you of course have the option to tell us that the data should only be used by Zalando. If so, we will not forward your information to the responsible office, or will only do so without your personal information, provided that your concerns can be processed in this way.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you transmit messages to us for other users via functions provided for this purpose (e.g. product evaluations), we may publish these within the scope of our services.
								</p>
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
									<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
										<span>Recording of telephone conversations</span>
										<p>
											Telephone conversations, for example with our hotline, will only be recorded with your consent for the purposes covered by your consent (e.g. quality assurance, training purposes). Consent to recording of conversations is of course voluntary. You may withdraw consent at any time with effect for the future, for example by asking the employee on the phone to stop the recording. You can find further information under <a href="#chapter-10">“Which data protection rights do I have?”</a>.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									Zalando also uses social network services such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to communicate with customers and users. We use these popular platforms to offer you further contact and information options beyond our in-house communication channels. Please bear in mind, however, that we do not have any influence on the terms of use for social networks and the services they offer, and only limited influence on their data processing. We therefore ask you to carefully check which personal data you share with us via social networks. We cannot influence the behaviour of social media operators, other users or third parties who may work with the operators of the social networks or also use these services.
								</p>

						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.7 Social network data</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									Social media functions may be integrated into Zalando’s services. These may include messenger services and so-called social plug-ins or social logins, such as “login with Facebook”. If you activate or use these functions and are a member of the relevant social network, we may receive data from their respective operators which allows us to identify you. We usually receive the following data from social networks:
								</p>
								<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
									<li>your public profile information (e.g. name, profile picture)</li>
									<li>Information on the type of device you are using</li>
									<li>the account ID of your profile with the relevant network (e.g. Facebook ID)</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									We will also not receive any data from the social network providers which could be used to identify or contact you unless you provide your consent. 
								</p>
								<p>
									In connection with advertising via social networks we generally only receive general demographic and interest-related information to make our adverts more efficient, e.g. that a particular advert was clicked on by a man from Berlin between the ages of 25 and 34 and interested in shopping and clothes. This information and these estimates come from the operator of the social network.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can find more detailed information in the relevant providers’ terms of use and privacy policies.
								</p>
								<p>
									Please also take into account the notice on the processing of social network data in connection with social network functions under <a href="#chapter-04">“Info on websites and apps”</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
									Zalando currently uses Facebook’s Messenger service and social plug-ins/logins from the following social networks:

							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									For particular purposes, we also collect data on your device’s current location when you use our services. Two different technologies are used for this.
								</p>
								<p>
									If you approve your device’s location services for an app, a website or another online service by Zalando, Zalando processes the location data collected by your device and provided to us in order to provide you with location-specific services.
								</p>
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
									<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
										<span>Example</span>
										<p>
											Some of our apps show you shops in your area or suggest products which correspond to your current location.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									If you allow a Zalando app to access your device’s location services, your location may be regularly processed by Zalando (e.g. even if you are not currently using the app). This serves to improve the user experience, for example by loading location-dependent content faster when you use the app at your location, or displaying location-based push notifications. We do not use this data to produce any motion profiles. You can obtain further information on location-based services if required. 
								</p>
								<p>
									We also collect location data derived from your device’s IP address (down to the city level). An anonymised IP address shortened to three characters is used for this purpose. Therefore, this cannot be used to identify your internet connection or device.
								</p>
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
									<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
										<span>What are IP addresses?</span>
										<p>
											Each device connected to the internet must be assigned a multiple-character, unambiguous number (example: 193.99.144.85). This is referred to as an IP address.
										</p>
										<p>
											The first three characters of an IP address are usually assigned to a particular region or a particular internet provider. The approximate location of the internet connection can therefore be derived from the IP address.
										</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<p>
									This procedure (so-called geolocalisation) is used by us and many other online shops, for example to identify fraud and suspicious orders (e.g. it may be suspicious in particular situations if an order from your customer account uses an IP address from a country where you have never previously made any orders).

							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.9 Photos and other personal content</h3>

								<p>
									Some of our service-specific applications allow you to share photos and other personal content with us or other users, in order to communicate with us or other users or to personalise services (e.g. by uploading a profile picture, using the Zalando app’s photo search or communicating with a stylist).

							<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">1.10 Information for campaigns and surveys</h3>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									If you take part in a campaign (e.g. competition) or survey (e.g. customer satisfaction survey for market research purposes) offered by Zalando, we ask you for personal information.
								</p>
								<p>
									For example, if you take part in a competition we generally ask you for your name and email address, so that we can inform you if you win and to ensure that each participant only takes part in the competition once.
								</p>
								<p>
									We may ask you for further information for some campaigns and surveys. This may be the case, for example, if we carry out a campaign with a partner and the partner needs information on you in order to make the prize available to you. In such cases we will, however, always inform you separately about the information required and how we use it.

									Zalando Group companies use the central Zalando SE’s central applicant management system to accept and process job applications.
								</p>
								<p>
									You can find the web portal for Zalando’s applicant management system at:<a href="https://jobs.zalando.com/">https://jobs.zalando.com/</a>.

							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
								<p>
									When using online and mobile services, it is inevitable that technical data will arise and be processed, in order to provide the functions and content offered and to display them on your device. We refer to this data collectively as “device and access data”. Device and access data arises each time you use an online and mobile service. It doesn’t matter who the provider is. Device and access data arise, for example, when you use:
								</p>
								<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
									<li>Websites</li>
									<li>Apps</li>
									<li>Email newsletters (i.e. when your newsletter interaction is captured)</li>
									<li>Location-based services</li>
								</ul>
								<p>
									On the one hand, Zalando collects device and access data from online and mobile services offered by Zalando itself (e.g. Zalando shop). On the other, Zalando may receive device and access data from online and mobile services provided by other companies, insofar as they are Zalando advertising partners or participate in the same online advertising networks (e.g. the “Google advertising network”). You can find further information under <a href="#chapter-08">“How does Zalando use my data for advertising?”</a>.

						Zalando processes your data in accordance with all applicable data protection laws. Of course, we observe the principles of data protection law for the processing of personal data. We therefore generally only process your data for the purposes explained to you in this Data Protection Declaration or shared when we collect the data. These are mainly purchase processing and the provision, personalisation and development as well as security of our services. We also use your data within the framework of the strict German and European data protection law, but also for other purposes such as product development, scientific research (especially in the areas of machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning) and market research, for the optimisation of business processes, the needs-based design of our services and personalised advertising.

						In this chapter, we also inform you of the legal basis on which we process data for the individual purposes. Depending on the legal basis for our processing of your data, you may have additional data protection rights alongside your permanent rights such as the right to information. For example, in individual cases you have the right to object to the processing of your data. You can find further information under <a href="#chapter-10">“Which data protection rights do I have?”</a>

							<p>
								We process your data for the provision of comfortable and useful services which correspond as well as possible to your needs and interests. Because the Zalando shop’s range encompasses hundreds of thousands of products and thousands of brands, it is necessary that we present our content and offers in a needs-based manner so that you can find products you are actually interested in. This requires a user-specific evaluation of the relevance of products and content.
							</p>
							<p>
								To personalise shopping in the Zalando shop we use device and access data which we collect for usage analysis. Alongside this, we also use device and access data which we receive from advertising partners while you visit the Zalando shop. If you are logged in with your customer account while visiting the Zalando shop, we also use profile data, interest data and shopping data to personalise your shopping experience. We refer to this form of shopping personalisation as on-site optimisation. Only such shopping personalisation allows us to present you with suitable search results, product suggestions, style recommendations and other content corresponding to your actual interests. Without such shopping personalisation, as carried out today by many online shops as standard, your search for relevant products would be less convenient and more protracted and the utility of our range for you would be lower. Shopping personalisation does not, of course, prevent you from accessing all content. It does, however, allow you to see content which is more relevant to you more quickly.

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">2.4 Fraud prevention, selection of payment methods and credit checks</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<h4>Prevention of fraud</h4>
							<p>
								In order to combat the risk of data security breaches, data pertaining to users of our services is encrypted in transmission. This applies both to ordering and to registering for a customer account. For this we use the coding system SSL (Secure Socket Layer). Encryption prevents third parties from viewing the data. To provide additional protection from external attacks, we rely on special security technologies which constantly check our systems and identify and report anomalies. We also use technical and organisational measures to secure our systems against loss, destruction, unauthorised access or distribution of customer data by unauthorised persons. In this manner we wish to keep the risk of unauthorised access as low as possible, because protecting your data is our top priority. However, we - like other companies - cannot guarantee absolute protection.
							</p>
							<p>
								We also use technical and manual procedures for fraud prevention in order to protect us and our users from misuse of data, especially by fraudulent orders. To this end, Zalando Payments GmbH summarises and evaluates your device and access data (including IP address, identifiers, user behaviour), shopping data and payment details (including address and other creditworthiness data from external credit agencies) as well as the change history of your profile information (e.g. when your delivery address was last changed) under a pseudonym when executing an order. The record is also compared with your previous usage and order habits. We also compare it to general records from all Zalando orders (also from other Zalando Group companies) involving confirmed or suspected fraudulent actions. This comparison allows us to identify fraud patterns and to prevent fraud and identity theft by comparing patterns.
							</p>
							<p>
								Following registration for a customer account, Zalando Payments GmbH transmits your name and your addresses as given in the profile to external credit agencies. This serves to ensure that you are actually registered and can be reached at the disclosed addresses. Typical indicators which - usually in combination - may increase the probability of attempted fraud include:
							</p>
							<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
								<li>Your delivery address was changed shortly before the submission of the order and/or is in a region with increased risk of fraud.</li>
								<li>Your order is particularly large and/or includes products which are subject to particularly high demand at present and/or are carried out at an unusual time for your region (e.g. at night).</li>
								<li>The payment methods invoice or direct debit are used for the order. </li>
								<li>There were suspicious login attempts on your account before the order was submitted, the pattern of which suggests automation.</li>
								<li>Your customer account is used from a suspicious IP address.</li>
								<li>Your customer account is used by an unknown or suspicious device.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								If our security system suspects attempted fraud or an increased risk of fraud, the relevant procedure will be forwarded to the Zalando fraud team for manual investigation. Appropriate preventative measures will be taken in view of the risk of fraud (e.g. temporary blocking of the customer account or restriction of payment methods offered).
							</p>
							<span>Legal basis:</span>
							<p>
								If your data is processed to prevent fraud at your expense, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) b GDPR. This processing of your data otherwise occurs on the basis of Article 6 (1) f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest and that of other users in the identification and prevention of fraud and clarification of criminal offences.
							</p>
							<h4 id="payment">Choice of payment methods</h4>
							<p>
								Before we show you the payment methods available for a purchase, Zalando Payments GmbH will carry out a risk assessment. Your previously collected purchase data, payment details, creditworthiness data, data on your previous payment behaviour as well as your profile information (such as surname, first name, delivery and billing address, email address, date of birth) will be used to carry out the risk assessment. The assessment and evaluation will be carried out automatically using statistically justified estimates of the default risk in relation to the payment methods we offer. Within the framework of the risk assessment, Zalando Payments GmbH also transmits your data to external credit agencies to receive general information from these on the evaluation of the payment-specific default risks (e.g. on whether your address is plausible and up-to-date) as well as, in individual cases, creditworthiness data, perhaps on open invoices and circumstances directly resulting in a risk of payment default (e.g. insolvency, deferral due to inability to pay). Which specific creditworthiness data is taken into account in the course of the risk assessment may vary from country to country.
							</p>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
									<span>Note</span>
									<p>
										You can find country-specific information on the credit agencies charged with carrying out the risk assessment and on the creditworthiness data used under <a href="#chapter-14">“country-specific information”</a>.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								The default risk is assessed separately for each payment method in the form of an estimate. If the risk assessment yields a positive result, we can offer all the payment methods we generally offer. Otherwise, we will only offer you particular payment methods. Factors which may influence the availability of a payment method include:
							</p>
							<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
								<li>The combination of name and address could not be found. This may result from typing errors, moves, marriage or a change of district.</li>
								<li>You have given a delivery address, packing station or company address differing from the billing address.</li>
								<li>There are still open claims against you.</li>
								<li>There have been payment disruptions with particular payment methods in the past.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								The risk assessment will not mean that you are not offered any payment method. If you are not in agreement with the payment methods offered, you can inform us of this in writing by letter or email at <a href="mailto:privacy_policy@zalando.co.uk">privacy_policy@zalando.co.uk</a>. We will then check the decision again, taking your viewpoint into account.
							</p>
							<span>Legal basis:</span>
							<p>
								If you have given consent to the processing of your data as described above for the choice of payment methods, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) a GDPR (Consent). Otherwise, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest in avoiding default risks.

									<span>Notice of withdrawal</span>

							<h4>Credit check</h4>
							<p>
								In addition to the <a href="#payment">risk assessment</a> Zalando Payments GmbH, processes your data before showing you the payment methods we make available for a purchase from us, in the course of an automated credit check. This check serves to prevent payment defaults and to ensure our security, as it allows us to recognise attempted fraud and other offences.
							</p>
							<p>
								Along with data already in Zalando Payments GmbH’s possession, creditworthiness data from external credit agencies in the form of score values is also used. Score values are statistically justified estimates of the future risk of a person defaulting and are represented as a numerical value, such as a percentage. To this end, Zalando Payments GmbH transmits on our behalf the personal data required for a credit check (generally your first and last name, your address and if necessary your date of birth) to the external agency. Address data may also be taken into account when calculating your score. The credit agency uses the data transmitted by us to correspondingly assess your creditworthiness on the basis of mathematical-statistical procedures.

								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">

								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								Depending on the result of the credit check, i.e. whether it is positive or negative, we will show you appropriate payment methods which you can use to continue and complete your purchase.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you are not in agreement with this, you can inform us of this in writing or by email at <a href="mailto:privacy_policy@zalando.co.uk">privacy_policy@zalando.co.uk</a>. We will then check the decision again, taking your viewpoint into account.

								The legal basis for the credit check described above is Article 6 (1) b GDPR, because it is necessary for the execution of necessary pre-contractual measures. This processing of your data otherwise occurs on the basis of Article 6 (1) f GDPR, based on our legitimate interest and that of other users in the avoidance of payment defaults, the identification and prevention of fraud and the clarification of criminal offences.

It is a prerequisite for this that these new purposes which the data is to be used for were not fixed or foreseeable when the relevant data was collected and the new purposes are compatible with the purposes for which the relevant data was originally collected. For example, new developments in the legal or technical sphere and new business models and services may lead to new processing purposes.

						The development and provision of personalised functionalities and services for you is our top priority.

The processing of your data to personalise our service is therefore an integral part of Zalando’s service.

						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Personalised services allow us to offer you better, more practical and more secure services. To this end we use the data we have stored about you in order to determine your needs and interests. On this basis we can offer you more relevant content corresponding to your needs and interests. Of course, you still have access to all content. Personalisation allows you to see content which is more relevant to you more quickly, or content is specially presented to you (e.g. in the form of individual product recommendations).

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">3.2 Why do I need a customer account?</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Most of our personalised services require you to set up a customer account so that we can save data we collect on you at a central location.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">3.3 Which data is saved on my customer account?</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Data which we collect about you is saved on your customer account, along with your customer number (customer ID). The customer number is a randomly generated sequence of numbers which does not contain any personal data. Your data is associated with your customer number, in order to link you to your customer account. The customer number also functions as a pseudonym.

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">3.4 Which data is used for personalisation?</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Personalised content is generally selected on the basis of all data stored on your customer account.
							</p>
							<p>
								If device and access data is used which is not saved on your customer account, these are only pseudonymised for the relevant personalisation (so e.g. in connection with your customer number, but not in connection with your named or other directly identifying profile data) for the duration of the usage.

							<p>
								You can view most of the data we have stored on your customer account at any time. If required you can also edit this data on your account and influence personalisation, perhaps by providing your preferences.
							</p>
							<p>
								If personalisation is based on device and access data, you can prevent the collection of this data by deactivating the collection of this data by tracking tools. Please bear in mind, however, that you will receive less or no personalised content and services. Please bear in mind that the data used for personalised services are also needed for other purposes (including the provision of our services), in which case the collection of the data required will continue to be collected. However, the advertising presented to you will then not be personalised.

					<p>
						We use your data to provide access to the Zalando websites and apps. Along with the device and access data collected whenever you use these services, the type of data processed as well as the processing purposes depend especially on how you use the functions and services provided via our services. We also use the data collected when you use our services to find out how our online offering is used. We use this information and other information in the course of shopping personalisation to improve our services and for personalised advertising.

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">4.1 Providers</h3>

							<p>

							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">4.2 Which data is collected?</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								We generally collect all the data which you directly share with us via our services.
							</p>
							<h4>Device and access data</h4>
							<p>
								Whenever you access our services and databases, we collect device and access data and record it in so-called server log files. The IP address it contains is anonymised shortly after the end of the relevant session, as soon as storage is no longer required to maintain the functionality of the relevant website. 
							</p>
							<p>
								If it is available and activated on your device, we also collect a device-specific ID number (e.g. a so-called “promo ID” if you are using an Android device or an “ad ID” if you are using an Apple device). This device ID is issued by the manufacturer of your operating system and can be read by websites and apps and used to present content on the basis of your usage habits. If you do not want this, you can deactivate it at any time in your device’s browser settings or system settings.
							</p>
							<h4>Login</h4>
							<p>
								We set up password-protected personal access for users who register for a customer account or another service. If you do not log out again after logging in with your login details, most services automatically keep you logged in. Depending on the type of service, a cookie or similar technology is used for this. This function allows you to use part of our services without having to log in again every time. For security reasons, however, you will be asked to enter your password again if, for example, you want to change your profile information or submit an order. You can find more information under <a href="#chapter-03">“Personalised services”</a>
							</p>
							<h4>Social Plug-ins</h4>
							<p>
								Our services may contain social plug-ins (“plug-ins”) from various social networks. These plug-ins allow you, for example, to share content or recommend products. The plug-ins are deactivated as standard and therefore do not send any data. You can activate the plug-ins by clicking on the corresponding button (e.g. “activate social media”. The plug-ins can also be deactivated again with a click. If the plug-ins are activated, your web browser sets up a direct connection to the web servers of the relevant social network. The content of the plug-ins is then transferred by the social network directly to your web browser and integrated by the latter into our website. Integrating the plug-ins allows the social network to receive the information that you have called up the relevant page of our internet offering and can collect your device and access data. If you are logged into the social network, the latter may also assign the visit to your account with the relevant social network. If you interact with the plug-ins, for example by clicking the Facebook “like” button or making a comment, the corresponding information will be transmitted by your browser directly to the social network and stored there. The purpose and scope of the data collection, and the further processing and use of the data by the particular social networks and your rights and configuration options concerning this to protect your privacy, can be found in the privacy notices of the respective social networks and websites. You can find the links to these below. Even if you are not registered with the social networks, websites with active plug-ins may send data to the networks. An active plug-in will place a cookie with an ID each time you call up the website. Because your web browser sends this cookie without being asked every time you connect to a server, the social network could in principle create a profile of which websites the user belonging to the ID had called up. And it would also be quite possible to assign this ID to a person, for example if they later registered with the social network.
							</p>
							<h4>Facebook social plug-ins</h4>
							<p>
								We use plug-ins by the social network facebook.com, operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”), on several websites. You can find the link to Facebook’s Data Protection Declaration here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Facebook’s privacy policy</a>.
							</p>
							<h4>Twitter social plug-ins</h4>
							<p>
								We use plug-ins by the social network Twitter, operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA (“Twitter”), on several websites. You can find the link to Twitter’s privacy policy here: <a href="https://twitter.com/en/privacy">Twitter’s privacy policy</a>.
							</p>
							<h4>Pinterest social plug-ins</h4>
							<p>
								We use plug-ins by the social network Pinterest, operated by Pinterest Inc., 651 Brannan Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA (“Pinterest”), on several websites. You can find the link to Pinterest’s privacy policy here: <a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy">Pinterest’s privacy policy</a>.
							</p>
							<h4>Social Logins</h4>
							<p>
								Our services may offer you the option of registering with us directly using your social network accounts. If you wish to use this function, you will first be forwarded to the relevant social network’s offering. There you will be asked to log in with your user name and password. Of course, we do not ourselves take note of your login details. If you are already logged in, this step will be skipped. The relevant social network then notifies you and asks you to confirm which data are transmitted to us (e.g. public profile, friends list, email address and current residence). We use the data transmitted to create your customer account, but will not, of course, save your friends list, for example. No further permanent connection between your customer account and your social network account will take place. We also receive social network data from the providers of the relevant social networks.
							</p>
							<h4 id="shopping">Shopping personalisation</h4>
							<p>
								Our services use the device and access data from the usage analysis, which are collected when you use our service, for shopping personalisation. Depending on the type of service, this may include common tracking technologies using tracking pixels and identification cookies or similar Ids (so-called tagging). In addition, our advertising partners may collect your device and access data in this way, in order to provide us with information on your interests and demographic data (such as age, gender, region) during your use of our services. This allows us to present you with advertising and/or particular offerings and services which correspond to your interests (for example product recommendations based on the fact that you have only viewed trainers in the last few days). Our goal when doing this is to make our offering as attractive to you as possible and to present you with advertising corresponding to your interest areas. Of course, you can continue to use all content and functions. This on-site optimisation does, however, allow us to first show you content and functions which are more relevant for you. On-site optimisation is carried out automatically by our systems, which recognise that users have repeatedly called up products and content from particular categories.

							</ul>
							<h4>Info on website cookies</h4>
							<p>
								Our websites use cookies. Accepting cookies is not a prerequisite for using our websites. We would, however, like to point out that our websites can only function on a limited basis if you do not accept cookies. You can set your browser up in such a way that cookies are only saved if you agree to this.
							</p>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
									<span>What are cookies?</span>
									<p>
										Cookies are small text files which are saved by your web browser and which save particular settings and data for exchange with our web server. 
									</p>
									<p>
										A distinction is generally made between two different types of cookies, so-called session cookies, which are deleted as soon as you close your browser, and temporary/permanent cookies which are stored for a longer period. Storing this data helps us to design our websites and services for you accordingly and makes them easier for you to use, for example by saving particular entries so that you do not have to repeat them constantly.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								The cookies used by our website may come from Zalando or advertising partners. If you only wish to accept the Zalando cookies, but not our advertising partners’ cookies, you can choose the corresponding setting in your browser (e.g. “block third-party cookies). The help function in your web browser’s menu bar generally shows you have to reject new cookies, and to turn off cookies which have already been received. We recommend that you completely log out after you finish using our website on shared computers which are set to accept cookies and Flash cookies.
							</p>
							<p>
								Our services use three categories of cookies:
							</p>
							<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
								<li>Necessary cookies: These cookies are required for optimal navigation and operation of the website. For example, these cookies are used to implement the basket function, such that the goods in your basket stay saved while you continue with the purchase. The necessary cookies also serve to save particular inputs and settings which you have made so that you don’t have to constantly repeat them, and to adapt Zalando content to your individual interests. Only limited use of the website is possible without necessary cookies.</li>
								<li>Statistical cookies: These cookies collect device and access data to analyse the use of our website, such as which areas of the website are used how (so-called surfing behaviour), how fast content is loaded and whether errors occur. These cookies only contain anonymous or pseudonymous information and are only used to improve our website and to find out what our users are interested in, and to measure how effective our advertising is. Statistical cookies can be blocked without adversely affecting the navigation and operation of the website.</li>
								<li>Marketing cookies (“tracking cookies”): These cookies contain identifiers and collect device and access data, in order to adapt personalised advertising on Zalando websites to your individual interests. Our advertising partners who operate online advertising networks also collect device and access data on our websites. This allows us to display personalised advertising on other websites and in other providers’ apps which fits your interests (so-called retargeting). Marketing cookies can be blocked without adversely affecting the navigation and operation of the website. Shopping personalisation may, however, not be possible.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We have collected country-specific overviews of all cookies used in the Zalando shop. You can find these under <a href="#chapter-15">“Information on individual websites”</a>.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">4.3 Info on apps</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<h4>App stores/installation</h4>
							<p>
								Zalando apps are available on app platforms run by third parties, so-called app stores (e.g. Google Play and Apple App Store). Download may therefore require prior registration with the relevant app store. Zalando has no influence on the processing of your data in connection with your registration with and use of these app stores. The operator of the relevant app store therefore has full responsibility. Please get information if required from the relevant app store operator directly.
							</p>
							<h4>Sharing content</h4>
							<p>
								If your operating system has an integrated function for sharing app content, you can call this up in our apps via the share or recommend button in order to share content or recommend products. Depending on which functions your device or operating system has and how you have configured your device, you can also use social networks to share content.
							</p>
							<p>
								We would like to point out that the share functions used by our app are operating system-side functions. We do not receive any information on the recipients and content of your communication. You can get more information on the share functions and your configuration options from the manufacturer of your device.
							</p>
							<p>
								Which social networks are available to you for sharing content depends on which social networks you are a member of and how you have configured your membership account and device. You can find further information in the relevant privacy policies of the social networks you use.
							</p>
							<h4>Location-based services</h4>
							<p>
								The functions of some of our apps use your device’s location services to collect location information. This is for the purpose of offering you app-based services and content tailored to your current location. For example, an app can show you transactions in your area and suggest products to you which are suited to the weather at your current location. If you allow the app to access location services, your location will be regularly transmitted to us for this purposes. We do not use this data to produce any motion profiles.
							</p>
							<h4>Push service</h4>
							<p>
								Our apps can inform you using push notifications of particular events or topics even if you are not currently using the app. Push notifications are an app-specific form of notification which we can use to address you directly. If you do not want this, you can deactivate the push service at any time using your device settings and in the settings within the app.
							</p>
							<p>
								If you activate the push notification service, your device will be assigned a device-specific push ID. For technical reasons, no push notifications can be sent without a push ID. Push Ids are only encrypted, randomly generated sequences of number.
							</p>
							<h4>System authorisations</h4>
							<p>
								For some functions, our apps must be able to access certain interfaces and data on your device. Depending on which operating system you use, this may require your express consent. Below we explain to you which authorisations (if these are relevant for the processing of your data) our apps may request and for which kind of functions these authorisations are required. You can change your authorisation settings in your devices’ system settings.
							</p>
							<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
								<li>Location services/location information: Authorisation for access to your device’s location services is required, so that an app can access the location determined by your device. If you do not allow access, the location-based display of content may not be possible, or may only be possible on a limited basis.</li>
								<li>Notifications/push notifications: Authorisation is required for the use of the push service. Some devices activate authorisation for all apps as standard. </li>
								<li>Access to saved photos: The authorisation is necessary so that an app can access saved photos (read access) or photos produced by an app can be saved on your device (write access).</li>
								<li>Camera: Authorisation is required so that an app can use your device’s camera function, perhaps to take photos or capture QR codes. The relevant app will only access the camera if you use the relevant function in the app.</li>
								<li>Requesting mobile data (iOS) or access to all networks and network connections (Android): When using or installing certain apps, these authorisations will be requested in order to allow the relevant app to transfer data via your device’s internet connection (by WLAN or data connection). This authorisation may be necessary in order to transfer inputs in the app, e.g. in the course of a search, to our servers.</li>
								<li>Changing, deleting or reading the content of USB memory devices/SD cards: These authorisations are required to allow the relevant app to store or read data on your device’s memory or any auxiliary storage. The relevant app will only read the data which was stored in connection with the use of this app.</li>
							</ul>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="z-home-pp__subChapter">
						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">4.4 Online advertising/retargeting</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Our websites and apps contain cookies and similar tracking technologies from advertising partners which operate an online advertising network. This also allows our advertising partners to collect your device and access data and to present you with personalised advertising on other websites and in other providers’ apps targeted to your interests (e.g. advertising based on which products you have previously viewed in the Zalando shop).
							</p>
							<p>
								You can find further information under <a href="#chapter-08">“How does Zalando use my data for advertising?”</a>
							</p>

								You can deactivate the processing of your data for retargeting at any time:

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">4.5 Usage analysis</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								We use common tracking technologies to evaluate device and access data. This allows us to find out how our offering is being used by our users in general. We do this using identification cookies and similar identifiers. This allows us to find out, for example, which content and topics are particularly popular, when our services are used the most, from which regions (down to the city level) our services are used and which browsers and devices our users generally use.
							</p>
							<p>
								We may also carry out so-called A/B tests in the course of usage analysis. A/B tests are a special kind of usage analysis. A/B testing (also known as split testing) is an approach to comparing two versions of a website or app in order to find out which version performs better, is more popular or lets users find their desired content quicker. Producing a version A and version B and testing both versions provides data which makes it easier and faster to make changes to services and content.

There are also service-specific newsletters, which are integral components of a particular service.

								When sending out our notifiable newsletters (such as the Zalando shop newsletter), we use the so-called double opt-in procedure or single opt-in procedure (country-dependent), i.e. we will only send you the newsletter if you have given explicit prior consent to us activating the newsletter. If a double opt-in is required in your country, you must also have confirmed that the email address you have shared with us belongs to you. For this purpose we will send you a notification email and ask you to confirm by clicking on one of the links in this email that you are the owner of the email address you have shared with us. We may waive this measure if you have already confirmed to us in this way for another purpose that you are the owner of this email address.

							</p>
							<p>
								We collect device and access data which arise when you interact with a newsletter. For this evaluation, the newsletters contain links to image files stored on our web servers. When you open a newsletter, your email programme loads these image files from our web server. We collect the device and access data which then arises in pseudonymised form under a randomly generated ID number (newsletter ID), which we will not use to identify you without your consent. This way we can understand whether and when you have opened which issues of a newsletter. The links contained in the newsletters likewise contain their newsletter ID so that we can determine which content you are interested in. We use the data collected here to create a user profile for your newsletter ID in order to personalise newsletter content according to your interests and usage habits and to statistically analyse how our users use the newsletter service. We connect this data to data which we collect within the framework of usage analysis.
							</p>
							<p>
								This shopping personalisation is an integral component of the Zalando shop newsletter.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can object to newsletter analysis at any time by deactivating the corresponding newsletter service. Of course, you will also find an unsubscribe link in every issue of our newsletter. You can also find further information under <a href="#chapter-10">“Which data protection rights do I have?”</a>
							</p>
							<p>
								Alternatively, you can deactivate the display of images in your email programme. In this case, however, the newsletter will not be displayed to you in full.

					<p>
						We and our advertising partners use your data for personalised advertising presented to you in Zalando’s services and on other providers’ websites and apps. We and our advertising partners use the prevailing market technologies for this purpose. This allows us to advertise in a more targeted way in order to display as many adverts and offers to you which are actually relevant to you. This allows us to better meet our users’ needs as regards personalisation and discovering new products and to interest you in our service in the long run by providing a more personalised shopping experience.

						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
							<span>Example</span>
							<p>
								If you are looking for trainers on the website of a Zalando advertising partner, we can take this information into account in your product searches in the Zalando shop. This allows us e.g. to show you trainers first in the “shoes” area or to recommend you trainers in the feed on the homepage. If you inform us of preferences in your customer account or you have already bought sports items from us, we can also take this information into account in our recommendations.

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">8.1 Advertising formats and channels</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								The advertising formats used by Zalando and Zalando’s advertising partners include presentations in the Zalando shop (within the framework of on-site and in-app optimisation), adverts on social networks (e.g. Facebook ads, Instagram ads, YouTube video ads) and advertising spaces mediated via the online advertising networks used by Zalando such as DoubleClick by Google.

							</div>
							<p>
								Zalando does not sell any personal data. When our advertising customers book a Zalando advertising format with Zalando Media Solutions GmbH, they do not receive any data which could be used to contact or identify you without your express consent. Our advertising customers only receive anonymous, aggregated reports with information on the effectiveness and reach of the advertising services we provide. These reports are based on Zalando Media Solutions GmbH’s own surveys, and sometimes also take into account summarised reports which we receive from our advertising partners and social networks. These show, for example, how our advertising services have affected sales to various groups of customers.

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">8.2 Information which we use to create target groups</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								In creating target groups we use our own findings from data analysis on our users’ usage and purchasing behaviour and customers as well as our market research on user segmentation which we apply to the user data collected by Zalando. In doing this we especially consider aggregated, pseudonymised or anonymised shopping data, search histories, interests data and demographic profile data as well as device and access data.
							</p>
							<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInset">
								<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterInsetWrapper">
									<span>Example</span>
									<p>
										A target group may be: “Women between 25 and 35 years old who are fashion-conscious and interested in sport, and who have ordered an Adidas product in the last year”.
									</p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<p>
								Our advertising partners also have the option to provide us with their own data for user segmentation, which was collected by the advertising partners themselves. The advertising partners must undertake only to provide Zalando with aggregated, encrypted or anonymous data, so that we cannot assign the data to any particular person, especially any particular user of the Zalando shop. Some target groups are created on the basis of the users’ surfing behaviour. This is the case if advertising is only intended to be presented to users who have recently visited a particular website or searched for particular content.

						<h3 class="z-home-pp__subChapterTitle">8.3 How do we use this information in online advertising on the Zalando shop and in other Zalando services</h3>
						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								We use the above information within the framework of on-site optimisation in order to present you with more relevant information and content when you search for products, call up your feed or visit a product area. On-site and in-app optimisation is based on cookies and similar identification technologies for the pseudonymous collection of device and access data. This data is not used to identify you personally, but rather to evaluate your usage pseudonymously. Your data is never permanently combined with other personal data we have stored on your person. This technology allows us to present you with products and/or particular offerings and services with content based on your device and access data (for example advertising geared to the fact that you have only viewed sports clothing in the last few days).
							</p>
							<p>
								If you do not want on-site optimisation, you can deactivate this function at any time:
							</p>
							<ul class="z-home-pp__subChapterList">
								<li>To do this, please deactivate the “Data processing” function in the Zalando shop. You can find this function in the Zalando app in the info menu under the point “About us”.

								<li>In other services, please do this by deactivating web analysis or app analysis. Please bear in mind that data used for on-site and in-app optimisation is also used for other purposes (including the provision of our services).

								If we advertise via advertising formats offered by social networks (e.g. YouTube, Facebook, Instagram), we have the option of forwarding encrypted information on Zalando users (e.g. device and access data such as advertising and cookie IDs, email addresses) which we believe belong to an advertising customer’s target group or show particular features (e.g. age group, region, interests).
							</p>
							<p>
								The relevant social network will then - either on our behalf as an order processor or with the consent of the relevant user - decrypt the transmitted data and display the advertising booked by us to the user as part of his existing usage relationship with the relevant social network (if he is a member of the relevant social network).

						<div class="z-home-pp__subChapterContent">
							<p>
								Advertising partners which run an online advertising network may use cookies and similar technologies to pseudonymously collect your usage behaviour using device and access data on the Zalando shop and in other providers’ apps. These advertising partners use the data collected in order to identify the probability of you belonging to the target group we are addressing, and take this into account when choosing the adverts on the advertising spaces mediated via their online advertising network. This standard internet technology is referred to as retargeting. Retargeting allows us to run advertising which is as relevant to you as possible and to measure the efficiency and reach of the advertising materials, but also to check our advertising partners’ bills for campaigns we are running.

The Zalando shop serves as a sales platform for the mediation of purchase agreements within the framework of the Zalando partner programme. “Sale and shipping by our partner” is then displayed under the relevant Zalando partner item, along with the name of the relevant Zalando partner.

						<li>Your order and payment details and perhaps other details are generally subject to various legal retention obligations, such as those in the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB - Commercial Code) and the Abgabenordnung (AO - Tax Code). The law obliges us to retain this data for tax audits and financial audits for up to ten years. Only then can we finally delete the relevant data. </li>
						<li>Even if your data is not subject to any legal retention obligation, we may refrain in the cases allowed by the law from immediate deletion and instead carry out initial blocking. This applies especially in cases where we may need the relevant data for further contractual processing or prosecution or legal defence (e.g. in the event of complaints). The decisive criterion for the duration of the blocking is then the legal limitation periods. After the relevant limitation periods expire, the relevant data will finally be deleted.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Deletion may be waived in the cases allowed by law if the data is anonymous or pseudonymous and deletion would rule out or seriously hinder processing for scientific research or statistical purposes.
