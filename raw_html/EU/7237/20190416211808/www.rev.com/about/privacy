<h2>Our Policy:</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the web sites (collectively, the <strong>&quot;Site&quot;</strong>) of 
    Rev.com, Inc., including its subsidiaries and affiliates 
    (<strong>&quot;Related Companies&quot;</strong>) (collectively, 
    <strong>&quot;Rev&quot;</strong>, "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by 
    Rev and has been created to provide information about our company and transcription, 
    video caption, translation and document related services (the "Services") to our you. 
    This Privacy Policy sets forth Rev's policy with respect to its processing of two types 
    of data:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Personal data that users of our Services (<strong>&quot;Customers&quot;</strong>) ask us to process on their 
        behalf (<strong>&quot;Processor Data&quot;</strong>), which will include any personal data that Customers 
        provide to us to transcribe, caption, translate, or otherwise process for them. 
        When Rev processes personal data on behalf of a Customer, Rev is the "processor" 
        of the data under applicable law, and the Customer is the "controller". 
    </li>
    <li>
        Data, including personal data, that we process for our own business (<strong>&quot;Controller Data&quot;</strong>), 
        other than for our human resources and recruiting operations. This includes, for example, 
        the information we collect through the Site and the names and contact information of our 
        Customers and vendors. Under applicable law, Rev is the "controller" of such data.
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Our collection, use, and disclosure of Processor Data:</h2>
<p>
    We receive information from or on behalf of our Customers and their users. Because of the 
    nature of the Services, this information may contain any type of personal data, including 
    names, contact information, and other identifying information.
</p>
<p>
    Subject to our contractual obligations with our Customers, and depending on the particular 
    Services, we use and disclose Processor Data as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Providing Services:</strong> To provide, maintain, and improve the Services, 
        including by analyzing the Services and addressing security and business continuity issues.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Protecting Us and Others:</strong> To enforce the legal terms that govern the Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> To comply with law, and where we deem disclosure 
        appropriate to protect rights, safety and property (for example, for national security 
        or law enforcement).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As part of an actual or contemplated business sale, 
        merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets or reorganization.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistent with Customer Requirements:</strong> For other purposes requested or 
        permitted by our Customers or their users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Subject to our contractual obligations with our Customers, and depending on the particular 
    Services, we share Processor Data as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses 
        or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar 
        event, including during negotiations of such an event, Processor Data may be part of the transferred 
        assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share Processor Data with our Related Companies 
        for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Rev, like many businesses, sometimes 
        hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions 
        include maintaining databases. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Rev may disclose Processor Data if required to do so by law 
        or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, 
        (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Rev, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect 
        the personal safety of the general public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistent with Customer Requirements:</strong> Rev will disclose Processor Data for other 
        purposes requested or permitted by our Customers or users, or as reasonably required to perform 
        our business.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Our collection, use, and disclosure of Controller Data:</h2>
<p>
    When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, or become a Customer or are a vendor, we 
    may collect personal data and other information from you, as further described below:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personal Data that You Provide Directly to Us:</strong> We collect personal data from you when you voluntarily 
    provide such information, such as when you register for access to the Services (for example, your 
    name and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our 
    surveys, or contract with us. Wherever Rev collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a 
    link to this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personal Data that We Collect from Third Parties:</strong> We collect personal data from third 
    parties, such as lead generation firms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        By voluntarily providing us with personal data, you acknowledge that you have read this Privacy Policy 
        and understand that such personal data may be transferred from your current location to the offices 
        and servers of Rev and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States, 
        which may not offer the same level of protection as the country in which you are located.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Automatically Collected Data:</strong> When you interact with Rev through the Site or Services, 
    we receive and store certain automatically collected information collected passively using various technologies. 
    Rev may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by 
    Rev affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information 
    to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, 
    the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with the Services. 
    Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Rev often conducts research on 
    its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. 
    This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Rev may share this data with its affiliates, agents 
    and business partners. Rev may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to current 
    and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<p>
    In operating our Site, we may also use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the 
    computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional 
    functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie 
    on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than

    <strong>Online Analytics:</strong> We may use third-party web analytics services (such as those of Google Analytics) 
    on our Services to collect and analyze the information discussed above, and to engage in auditing, research or 
    reporting. The information (including your IP address) collected by various analytics technologies described in above 
    may be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of 
    the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive, analyzing usage trends, assisting with 
    fraud prevention, providing certain features to you, and other purposes. To prevent Google Analytics from using your 
    information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking 
    <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. If you receive 
    email from us, we may use certain analytics tools, such as clear GIFs, to capture data such as when you open our message 
    or click on any links or banners our email contains. This data allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications 
    and marketing campaigns.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Tailored Online Advertising:</strong> Third parties whose products or services are accessible or marketed via the 
    Services may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device to collect information about 
    your use of the Services, in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve advertising content based on past visits to our Services 
    and other sites and (ii) report how our advertising content impressions, other uses of advertising services, and interactions 
    with these advertising impressions and services are related to visits to our Services. We also may allow other third parties 
    (e.g., ad networks, servers and platform) to serve tailored advertising to you on the Services or on other websites or in other 
    mobile applications, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer or other device you use 
    to access the Services. We neither have access to, nor does this Privacy Policy does not govern, the use of cookies or other 
    tracking technologies that may be placed by such third parties. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser 
    advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer or mobile browser to deliver tailored 
    advertising (i.e., not just for the Services), you may visit the Network Advertising Initiative's Consumer 
    <a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/" target="_blank">Opt-Out Link</a> and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance's 
    <a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/?c=2&lang=EN" target="_blank">WebChoices Tool</a> to opt- out of receiving tailored advertising from 
    companies that participate in those programs. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Services, 
    you may still receive advertising content even if you opt out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will 
    just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any 
    choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.
</p>
<p>We use Controller Data as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Providing Services:</strong> To provide, maintain, and improve the Services, including by analyzing the Services 
        and addressing security and business continuity issues. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the personal 
        data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide personal data in order to obtain 
        access to the Services, we will use your personal data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use 
        of such services. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Communications:</strong> To communicate with you regarding the Services or to tell you about services we believe 
        will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you 
        to "opt-out" of receiving future marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out of 
        some administrative communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service notifications. 
        In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted 
        from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Protecting Us and Others:</strong> To enforce the legal terms that govern the Services.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Compliance with Laws:</strong> To comply with law, and where we deem disclosure appropriate to protect rights, 
        safety and property (for example, for national security or law enforcement).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As part of an actual or contemplated business sale, merger, consolidation, 
        change in control, transfer of substantial assets or reorganization.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consistent with Customer Requirements:</strong> For other purposes requested or permitted by our Customers 
        or their users, or as reasonably required to perform our business.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If Rev intends on using any personal data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will 
    be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the personal data is collected, consistent with 
    applicable laws.
</p>
<p>
    The laws in some jurisdictions require companies to tell you about the legal ground they rely on to use or disclose 
    personal data. To the extent those laws apply, our legal grounds for processing Controller Data are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> In most cases, we handle Controller Data on the ground that it furthers 
        our legitimate interests in commercial activities such as the following in ways that are not overridden by the 
        interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the affected individuals:
        <ul>
            <li>Protecting our Services, business, personnel and property</li>
            <li>Customer service</li>
            <li>Marketing</li>
            <li>Analyzing and improving our business</li>
            <li>Managing legal issues</li>
            <li>We may also process Controller Data for the same legitimate interests of our customers and business partners</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>To honor our contractual commitments to the individual:</strong> Some of our processing of Controller Data 
        is to meet our contractual obligations to individuals, or to take steps at customers' request in anticipation of 
        entering into a contract with them.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Consent:</strong> Where required by law, and in some other cases, we handle Controller Data on the basis of 
        consent. Where legally required (e.g., for the use of fingerprints for security purposes in certain jurisdictions), 
        this is explicit consent.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Legal compliance:</strong> We need to use and disclose Controller Data in certain ways to comply with our 
        legal obligations.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Rev is not in the business of selling Controller Data. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we share 
    Controller Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the 
        event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, including during negotiations of 
        such an event, Controller Data may be part of the transferred assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share Controller Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent 
        with this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Rev, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies 
        to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining 
        databases, shipping and fulfillment and processing payments.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Rev may disclose Controller Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith 
        belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property 
        of Rev, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect 
        against legal liability.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Your EU Rights and Choices:</h2>
<p>
    We offer the options described below for exercising rights and choices under applicable law, which are subject to important 
    limits or exceptions under applicable law.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>For Processor Data:</strong> To exercise rights or choices with respect to Processor Data, please make your request 
        directly to the Customer for whom we process the personal data.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>For Controller Data:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>
                To keep your personal data accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable 
                steps to update or correct personal data in our possession that you have previously submitted via this Site or Services.
            </li>
            <li>
                The law of your jurisdiction (for example, within the European Economic Area) may give you additional rights to request 
                access to and rectification or erasure of certain of your personal data we hold. In some cases, you may be entitled to 
                receive a copy of the personal data you provided to us in portable form or to request that we transmit it to a third party. 
                The law may also give you the right to request restrictions on the processing of your personal data, to object to processing 
                of your personal data, or to withdraw consent for the processing of your personal data (which will not affect the legality 
                of any processing that happened before your request takes effect). You may contact us as described below to make these requests.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        For example, residents of the European Economic Area and certain other jurisdictions may have a right to opt out of 
                        our processing of Controller Data for direct marketing purposes. You can exercise this right by contacting us as 
                        described below. Our marketing emails and certain other communications include unsubscribe instructions, which you 
                        can use to limit or stop the relevant communications.  Opt-out processes may take some time to complete, consistent 
                        with applicable law.  Certain communications (such as certain billing-related communications or emergency service 
                        messages) are not subject to opt-out.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                You may contact us with any concern or complaint regarding our privacy practices, and you also may lodge a complaint with the 
                relevant governmental authority.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Children:</h2>
<p>
    Rev does not knowingly collect personal information (as defined in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act) from children under 
    the age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not submit any personal information through the Services. We encourage parents 
    and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing their children never 
    to provide personal information on our Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 
    has provided personal information to Rev through the Services, please contact us, and we will endeavor to delete that information from 
    our databases.
</p>
<h2>Links to Other Web Sites / Services:</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. Our Services, in particular our Site, may contain links to other web sites or services 
    not operated or controlled by Rev (the <strong>&quot;Third Party Sites&quot;</strong>). The policies and procedures we described here do 
    not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from our Services do not imply that Rev endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We 
    suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy policies.
</p>
<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>
    Rev takes steps to protect personal data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no 
    Internet, email or other electronic transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so we cannot assure you that your personal data will 
    never be used or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, and you should take special care in deciding what 
    information you provide to us.
</p>
<h2>Data Retention:</h2>
<p>
    We will retain personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention 
    period is required or permitted by law. To provide security and business continuity for the activities described in this Privacy Policy, 
    we make backups of certain data, which we may retain for longer than the original personal data.
</p>
<h2>Other Terms and Conditions:</h2>
<p>
    Your access to and use of this Site is subject to any other agreements in place between us, including our Terms of Service located at: 
    <a href="/about/terms" target="_blank">/about/terms</a>
</p>
<h2>Changes to Rev's Privacy Policy:</h2>
<p>
    Our Services may change from time to time. As a result, at times it may be necessary for Rev to make changes to this Privacy Policy. 
    Rev reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and will notify you of such changes in compliance with applicable 
    laws. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above.
