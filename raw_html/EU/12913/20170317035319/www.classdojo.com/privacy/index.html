            ClassDojo’s mission is to give teachers, school leaders, parents, and students the power to create incredible classrooms. We’re humbled that millions of people like you trust ClassDojo to do that every day. Keeping this trust through your privacy and safety is incredibly important to us.
            <br> This Privacy Policy explains:
            <ul>
              <li>What information ClassDojo collects from you (and why we collect it),</li>
              <li>How we use and share that information,</li>
              <li>The choices you have, including how to access, update and delete your information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy applies to all products and services offered by Class Twist, Inc. (“ClassDojo,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and our subsidiaries or affiliates).
          </p>
          <p>
            We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms. We’ve also added a column on the right that provides short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to help even more with understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

          <p>
            ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents. In the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. They use the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Beyond the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to engage families. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, and also add posts to <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">Class Story</a> and <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209685943" target="_blank">School Story</a> - a private feed of moments from the classroom and school that only parents, “<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043" target="_blank">verified teachers</a>,” and school leaders can see. Teachers can also let parents see how their children are doing at school by sharing their student profiles with parents to highlight the feedback points they’ve earned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents access ClassDojo using a <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289" target="_blank">unique code</a> provided by their child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique code. Parents can only view their own children’s feedback points, not those of any other students. Students can also create their own account, but can only tie that account to a class after they receive a <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> from their teacher; if they’re under 13, they’ll need to have parental consent or notice (as applicable) in order to access certain features of their account. In the student account, students can, for example, see feedback given by their teacher, upload photos and videos that only they, parents of the class, and teachers can see, as well as customize their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo.
          </p>
          <p>
            When students set up a ClassDojo account, they create a unique username and password. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we ask for their age, and if they are under 13, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. **We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.** If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211828723" target="_blank">Student Stories</a> feature within the ClassDojo App on a device in school, the student (without needing to sign up for a ClassDojo student account) may take videos, photos and write captions (which may contain personal information) which will be collected by ClassDojo. If a student already has a student account, these photos, videos and captions may appear in their student account.  If the school or teacher elects to utilize this Student Stories feature, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986" target="_blank">COPPA</a>.  Additionally, the student’s teacher needs to approve the photo or video taken by the student before it can be shared with parents or students.
          </p>
          <p>
            School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, photos, and videos on School Story  - only parents connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School Leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students and message with parents, plus see <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176-What-can-School-Leaders-see-and-do-#web" target="_blank">Highlights</a> - a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school.

            Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves, after all. This is why we’ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit <a class="depress-on-click" href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online" target="_blank">OnGuard Online</a>.

            <a class="anchor" id="WhatInformationDoesClassDojoCollectFromChildrenAndHowIsItUsed"></a><strong>What information does ClassDojo collect from children, and how is it used?</strong><br>
            ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide a unique username (we advise students not to use their real names), a password, and the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> they have been given by their teacher to connect with a class. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child’s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account.<br><br>

            <strong>Photos and Videos</strong><br>
            If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize the Student Stories feature within the ClassDojo App on a device in school, the student (without needing to sign up for a ClassDojo student account) may take videos, photos and write captions (which may contain personal information) which will be collected by ClassDojo. If the school or teacher elects to utilize this Student Story feature, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986" target="_blank">COPPA</a>. Additionally, the student’s teacher must approve the photos or videos taken by students before they can be shared with parents. If a student already has a student account, photos, videos and captions may appear in their student account. Additionally, students may be able to upload photos and videos directly by signing into their student account (if so, this will only be with parental consent obtained from ClassDojo). Please note, that if you as a parent provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining parental consent, we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.<br><br>

            In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information collected automatically</a>" section.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, as required by law, or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third parties, except to <a class="depress-on-click" href="#ServiceProviders">service providers</a> necessary to provide the Service, as required by <a class="depress-on-click" href="#LegalRequirements">law</a>, or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Information collected from students (including personal information and information collected automatically) is <strong>never</strong> used or disclosed for third party advertising or for any first- or third-party behaviorally targeted advertising, and children’s personal information is <strong>never</strong> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers or advertisers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> assigned by that teacher. Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name, only initials, or even just seat numbers).

We will then provide the parent with notice and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided. If you are a student or a parent of a child and no longer want these communications to be sent, please either turn off the push notifications on your device, or contact us at privacy@classdojo.com.

If a teacher utilizes the Student Stories feature in the ClassDojo App on a device in the classroom, other students can view pictures or videos taken by other students in this same ClassDojo App on this shared device, but students can’t view each other’s individual student profiles (which contain feedback points). Parents will be able to view their own child’s Student Story (including videos and photos taken by other students that tag their child), but only after the teacher has approved the photos or videos.  Teachers may <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909" target="_blank">share their classes</a>, including <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>, Student Stories, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school. Please note that if the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, which is not a direct feature of ClassDojo (i.e., through utilizing non-ClassDojo resources, such as projecting via a smartboard or interactive whiteboard), students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatars (which can be the default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and total feedback points - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work. Students’ full profiles showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view, and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App on their mobile devices — and many do!

            We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as his or her student account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">active</a>, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information (<strong>“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”</strong>):
            <ol>
              <li><p><strong>Minimal information:</strong>
                As mentioned before, ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to create accounts on our Service: we ask students to provide just the unique student code given by their teacher, a username, and a password. We advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian’s email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). Beyond this information, the ClassDojo student account does not allow students the ability to enter any additional personal information to set up an account. The Student Stories feature (which can be used without signing up for a student account) includes teacher approval of photos or videos taken by a student within the ClassDojo app used on a classroom device. If a student already has a student account, photos, videos and captions that have tagged that student may appear in their student account. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information collected automatically</a>” section.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>One year deletion policy for feedback points:</strong><br>
                To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students' <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted, unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2016, then unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2017 any feedback points given in that class on or before January 1, 2016 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student accounts entirely). Teachers can also delete feedback points at any time.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Deleting inactive accounts:</strong><br>
                If a student’s account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will automatically delete the student account, including all personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old. Learn more about how we delete student accounts <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">here</a>.

The types and amounts of information collected will vary depending on whether the user is a teacher, school leader, parent or student (e.g. we collect minimal information from students) and how they use ClassDojo (e.g. if teachers join their school, we may need to collect school address information).

            There are currently three categories of users on our Service: teachers, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section <a class="depress-on-click" href="#WhatInformationDoesClassDojoCollectFromChildrenAndHowIsItUsed">above</a>; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:

                  Account Sign-up and Profile Information:
                </strong>
                  To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. If you create a ClassDojo account as a student, you will be asked to enter the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422145" target="_blank">unique code</a> you have been given by your teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for your age and, if you are under 13, a parent or guardian’s email address so we can give parents notice or seek parental consent, as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information to create their student accounts., Teacher and school leader profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school; however, no teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.

                  School Information and Collaboration Features:
                </strong>
                  If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher or school leader, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and school leaders within the same school such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on School Story for parents and other "<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043" target="_blank">verified teachers</a>" in that school to see.

                  Class Information:
                </strong>
                  As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or School Leaders in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information.

                </strong>
                  As a teacher or school leader, you can invite your students’ parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may also ask you for access to the contacts on your mobile device to prevent you having to enter contact information for those invitations you send through our application and may store these contacts from your address book. If these individuals would like to request deletion of their information, they may contact us directly at privacy@classdojo.com.

                  As a teacher or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These feedback points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s feedback points can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s parents, and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual feedback points).

                  As a teacher or school leader, you can privately message with individual parents that have signed up for the Service, or send broadcast messages to all parents at once, using the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309" target="_blank">ClassDojo Messaging</a>, Class Story, and School Story features. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature such as <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">Class Story</a> or <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/209685943" target="_blank">School Story</a>, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), the student or parent can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it. We will store messages, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents.

For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices.

            <strong>3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy:</strong> In addition to the policy above that applies to all users, we only keep a student’s personal information while the student’s account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, we have a <a class="depress-on-click" href="#HowLongDoesClassDojoKeepChildrensInformation">3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy</a> to protect students’ information: we collect minimal information from students, delete feedback points automatically after 1 year if parents or students haven’t created associated accounts, and delete student accounts if they are <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for twelve months.
