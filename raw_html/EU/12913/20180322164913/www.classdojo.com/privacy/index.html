            ClassDojo’s mission is to give teachers, school leaders, parents, and students the power to create incredible classrooms. We’re humbled that millions of people like you trust ClassDojo to do that every day. Keeping this trust through your privacy and safety is incredibly important to us.
            <br> This Privacy Policy explains:
            <ul>
              <li>What information ClassDojo collects from you (and why we collect it),</li>
              <li>How we use and share that information,</li>
              <li>The choices you have, including how to access, update and delete your information.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            This policy applies to all products and services offered by Class Twist, Inc. (“ClassDojo,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and our subsidiaries or affiliates).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Privacy Policy is designed to provide transparency into our privacy practices and principles. We’ve done our best to write this policy in simple, clear terms, but if you’re not familiar with terms like personal information, cookies, IP address, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">key terms</a>. We’ve also added a column on the right that provides short explanations of the legal language in plain English (it starts with ‘Basically...’) to help even more with understanding, but it isn’t legally binding.

This policy applies whether you use ClassDojo through http://www.classdojo.com (the “ClassDojo Website”), our mobile applications (the “ClassDojo Apps”), or any of our other products or services that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Service”).

          What is ClassDojo?

      <div class="row collapse legal-body" id="WhatIsClassDojo">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents. In the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a>”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. They use the ClassDojo App or the ClassDojo Website - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Beyond the classroom, teachers use ClassDojo to engage families. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, and also add posts to <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">Class Story</a> and <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">School Story</a> - a private feed of moments from the classroom and school that only students, parents, “<a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043" target="_blank">verified teachers</a>,” and school leaders can see. Additionally, students can view their own feedback points and upload content to their own Student Story - a private feed of content that only the student, their teacher, or the student’s parents can see.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parents access and set up an account on ClassDojo using a <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730289" target="_blank">unique parent code</a> provided by their child’s teacher, or through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code. Parents can only view their own children’s feedback points and Student Story, not those of any other students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students can also have their own account to view feedback given by teachers, and perform additional tasks, such as adding photos and videos of classwork to their Student Story, writing journal entries, and customizing their ClassDojo avatar - a cute monster that represents the student on ClassDojo. In order to have a student account created, students will need to either (1) have the student account created at school by their teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent); or (2) receive a unique code from their teacher to create their own account with a username and password (which will require parental consent); or (3) have their parents create their student account at home after we have obtained parental consent.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a parent sets up an account for their child, they will first need a parent account. We don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the student account creation process, but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if they are under 13, we will then seek to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to proceed with creating their child’s account. Once we have obtained parental consent, the child’s account will be set up and a QR code will be accessible on the parents device to let the child log in to their student account. Although not required under <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986" target="_blank">COPPA</a>, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students 13 and above at our discretion. We don’t ask students to enter any other <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> when a parent sets up their account. We will also seek to obtain parental consent if a child sets up their own account after receiving the unique code from their teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts within the ClassDojo App on a shared device (or any other devices) in school, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA to create the student account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts. After doing so, if the teacher is creating the student’s account, the teacher will be able to share a QR code with their class and then  students can scan the QR code and tap their name to log in and start using their student account. Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own account using the unique code provided by the teacher.  When students set up their own ClassDojo account, they create a unique username and password and will use this to access their account instead of the QR Code. In accordance with COPPA, we ask for their age, and if they are under 13, we also ask for a parent or guardian’s email address to request parental consent. We don’t ask students to enter any other <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> when setting up an account.  Any student account (or access to a student account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts). Additionally, the student’s teacher needs to approve any photo or video taken by the student in any student account (meaning parent created, student created or teacher created) before it can be shared with parents on Student Story.
          </p>
          <p>
            School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, photos, and videos on School Story  - only teachers, parents, and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School Leaders can also create classes, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students and message with parents, plus see <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176-What-can-School-Leaders-see-and-do-#web" target="_blank">Highlights</a> - a high-level overview of all the feedback and engagement happening within their school.

            Protecting children’s privacy is especially important to us - we’re educators and parents ourselves, after all. This is why we’ve signed the Student Privacy Pledge and received iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor seal, signifying that this Privacy Policy and our practices with respect to the operation of the Service have been reviewed and approved for compliance with iKeepSafe’s COPPA Safe Harbor program. COPPA protects the online privacy of children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”); for more information about COPPA and generally protecting children’s online privacy, please visit <a class="depress-on-click" href="http://www.onguardonline.gov/articles/0031-protecting-your-childs-privacy-online" target="_blank">OnGuard Online</a>.

            <a class="anchor" id="WhatInformationDoesClassDojoCollectFromChildrenAndHowIsItUsed"></a>
            <strong>What information does ClassDojo collect from children, and how is it used?</strong><br>
            ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use our Service. Currently student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. When logging into a student account created by a parent or teacher, students do not need to provide any information beyond scanning a unique QR code provided by their teacher or by their parent and in the classroom, choosing their name from a list shown to them. If a student has created their own account, they will use the username and password they created.<br><br>

            When a parent sets up an account for their child, they will first need a parent account. In order to set up a parent account, parents must first receive the unique parent code provided to their child by their child’s teacher or sent through an email/SMS invitation directly from the teacher containing the unique parent code. We don’t ask the child’s parent for any additional information regarding their child during the student account creation, but link the account to the name and information provided by the child’s teacher. In accordance with COPPA, we may ask the parent to provide the date of birth or age of their child, and if the child is under 13, we will also then seek to obtain verifiable parental consent in order to proceed with creating their child’s account. Once we have obtained parental consent, the child’s account will be set up and a QR code will be accessible on the parents device to allow the child to log in to their student account. We don’t ask students to enter any other <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> when a parent sets up their account. Although not required under COPPA, we may choose to impose parental consent requirements on students 13 and above at our discretion.<br><br>

            If a student’s school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts on a shared device (or any other devices) in school, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary parental consent under COPPA to create the student account on behalf of the student and let students access their accounts. After doing so, if the teacher is creating the student’s account, the teacher will be able to share a QR code with their class and then students can scan the QR code and tap their name from the list of names shown to them to log in and start using their student account. Please note that if you, as a parent, provide an email to the school when the school is obtaining parental consent, we may send an email out to you asking you to verify your child’s account, but you will not receive any other emails unless you have opted in to email marketing or have separately created an account on our Service.<br><br>

            Alternatively, a teacher may choose to allow students to set up their own account using the unique code provided by the teacher. When students set up their own ClassDojo account, we ask students to provide a unique username (we advise students not to use their real names), a password and the unique code they have been given by their teacher to connect with the class.  They will use the username and password to access their account instead of the QR Code. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we also ask for the child’s age, and a parent or guardian email address from the child so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We will not use parent emails provided this way to market our Service to the parent, unless the parent has opted in to email marketing or has separately created an account on our Service. We don’t ask students to enter any other <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> when setting up an account.<br><br>

            Any student account (or access to a student account) created for the student by the parent, or the student’s teacher in class, or the student directly, are linked together (these are not different accounts).<br><br>

            <strong>Photos, Videos and Journal Entries</strong><br>
            Once a student account is created (whether created by the student’s teacher or parent or the student themself) and parental consent is obtained, students will be able to take and upload photos, videos and write journal entries (which may contain personal information) to their account and Student Story which will be collected by ClassDojo. The Student Story can only be viewed by the student themself, the student’s parents, and the student’s teachers and school leaders. If the school or teacher elects to utilize student accounts in the classroom, the school will be responsible for obtaining any necessary <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986" target="_blank">parental consent</a> under COPPA. Additionally, the student’s teacher must approve any post made by students (whether uploaded in their student account created at home or school) before it is shared with parents on Student Story. Any content uploaded by a student in their student account created by their parent or in the classroom by their teacher or themselves will appear in the same student account (these are not three different accounts).<br><br>

            <strong>Viewing Stories</strong><br>
            Students with student accounts may also view the Class Story and School Story, however, they will not be able to post content (such as videos or photos) to either the Class Story or School Story. Currently, students are limited to posting content to just their own Student Story.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the information listed above, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the "<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information collected automatically</a>" section.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use this information to provide the Service to the child, for security and safety purposes, as required by law, or to enforce our Terms. We will not require children to provide more <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> than is reasonably necessary in order to participate in the Service. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner inconsistent with COPPA, we will take appropriate steps to either delete the information, or immediately seek the parent’s consent for that collection. We do not disclose any personal information about children to third-parties, except to <a class="depress-on-click" href="#ServiceProviders">service providers</a> necessary to provide the Service, as required by <a class="depress-on-click" href="#LegalRequirements">law</a>, or to protect the security of the Service or other users. Additionally, personal information collected from students is <strong>never</strong> used for behaviorally-targeted advertising to students by us or any third-party, and children’s personal information is <strong>never</strong> sold or rented to anyone, including marketers and advertisers.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also receive from the child’s teacher whatever name he or she has provided for the student, and the <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> assigned by that teacher. Teachers can choose to provide full names for students (e.g., first name and last name) when setting up their class; they can also opt to only provide non-identifying information (e.g., just first name and seat number).

We will then provide the parent with notice and provide the parent the opportunity to prevent further notifications. The device identifier for a child’s account will only be associated with other personal information once parental consent is provided.

Only the student, the student’s parents, and the student’s teachers or School Leaders can see the student’s profile and Student Story. No child can upload content (such as a photo or video) to the Service except through their student account. This can’t happen for children without either (1) the parent providing parental consent directly to ClassDojo or (2) the child’s teacher representing to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary parental consent. No photos or videos added by a child to their student account is viewable by the general public. If a students add contents to their account in the classroom, students can’t view each other’s individual student accounts or Student Story unless they have intentionally chosen another student’s name from the list of names shown to them or viewed the camera roll locally on the device that may be saving photos and videos taken by students. Parents will still be able to view their own child’s Student Story if they have not separately created an account for their child, but only after the teacher has approved the photos or videos.

            Class Story and School Story are visible by students, teachers, parents and school leaders who have logged into their accounts and are associated with that particular class or school. They are not viewable by the general public. Parents, teachers and School Leaders can add content or comments to these stories, but students can only view or like content on these stories and are only able to do this once either the school or ClassDojo has obtained parental consent, if under 13.
          </p>

            Teachers may <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202027909" target="_blank">share their classes</a>, including feedback points, Student Stories, and Class Story, with other teachers or school leaders in their school. Please note that if the teacher chooses to display ClassDojo in their classroom, students physically present in that classroom may see other students’ names, avatars (which can be the default avatars, or avatars modified by students) and total feedback points - this is similar to how paper-based sticker charts displayed in a classroom might work. Students’ full profiles or Student Stories showing each feedback point awarded are not shown in this class view, and are therefore kept private for each student, their teacher(s), and their parents. Teachers can of course choose not to display ClassDojo this way, for example by using the ClassDojo App on their mobile devices — and many do!

          How Long Does ClassDojo Keep Children’s Information?

      <div class="row collapse legal-body" id="HowLongDoesClassDojoKeepChildrensInformation">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <p>
            We only keep a child’s <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> for as long as his or her student account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">active</a>, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to ensure the security of our community or our Service, or to enforce our Terms. More specifically, ClassDojo operates a 3-tier student data protection policy to protect all students’ (not just children’s) information (<strong>“3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy”</strong>):
            <ol>
              <li><p><strong>Minimal information:</strong>
                ClassDojo collects the minimal amount of information from students necessary to use the our Service. Currently, student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent; (2) by the student’s teacher; or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. When a parent or teacher sets up a student account for the child, we link that account to any existing name and information provided by the child’s teacher and don’t specifically ask for any additional <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> regarding the child. Once we have obtained parental consent (or the teacher has confirmed to have obtained any necessary parent consent), a QR code will be generated to allow the child to log in to the student account. If accessing the student account in class, the student will select their name from a class list after scanning the QR code. If a teacher provides a unique code to a student for the student to set up their own account, we ask students to provide just the unique code given by their teacher, a username, and a password. We advise students to not use any personal information in their username. Consistent with the requirements of COPPA, we ask students for their age, and a parent or guardian’s email address if they are under 13 years of age so we can seek verifiable parental consent or provide parental notice (as applicable). We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information when setting up an account. The student account also allows the student the ability to upload photos and videos and write journal entries which will also appear on the student’s Student Story.  The student’s teacher must approve the posts made by a student before parents can see them on Student Story.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond this information, ClassDojo does not allow students the ability to enter any additional personal information to set up a ClassDojo account. In addition to the information entered by the child, we automatically collect some information from any use of our Service as set forth in the “<a class="depress-on-click" href="#InformationCollectedAutomatically">Information collected automatically</a>” section.
              </p></li>
              <li><p><strong>One year deletion policy for feedback points:</strong><br>
                To protect students, ClassDojo sets limits on how long students' <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125" target="_blank">feedback points</a> are retained. For all students, feedback points older than 12 months are automatically deleted, unless the student or their parent chooses to retain them by creating their own associated account. For example, if a teacher sets up a class on ClassDojo on January 1, 2017, then unless students or parents create accounts, on January 1, 2018 any feedback points added in that class on or before January 1, 2017 would be deleted (and will continue to be deleted on an ongoing basis as each point reaches 12 months in age). This means feedback points cannot exist long-term without either being deleted automatically, or students or parents knowing about them and being able to access and delete them on their own (by deleting both the parent and student accounts entirely). Teachers can also delete feedback points at any time.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>Deleting inactive accounts:</strong><br>
                If a student’s account is <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for twelve months or more (meaning no teacher has given feedback to the student or messaged with the student’s parent, and neither the parent nor the student have logged into his or her account), ClassDojo will automatically delete the student account, including all student-uploaded content, personal information provided by students or collected by ClassDojo from students, as well as feedback points associated with the account that are more than 12 months old. Learn more about how we delete student accounts <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">here</a>. Please note that this does not include photos or videos or other information captured through Class Story or School Story which are shared with all parents and are not just part of the student account.

            We only keep a child’s personal information for as long as the account is active, unless we are required by law to retain it, need it to enforce our policies, or to ensure the security of our community. Additionally, we protect students with our industry-leading 3-Tier Student Data Protection Policy: (1) we collect only minimal information from students necessary to use the service, (2) we automatically delete their feedback points after a year - unless students or parents choose to save them for longer, and (3) we delete students’ accounts, including Student Stories, if they’re <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422165" target="_blank">inactive</a> for more than twelve months.

            There are currently four categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, parents, and students. We describe the information collected from students under 13 in the section <a class="depress-on-click" href="#WhatInformationDoesClassDojoCollectFromChildrenAndHowIsItUsed">above</a>; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:

                  Account Sign-up and Profile Information:
                </strong>
                  To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password and a profile photo. Student accounts are created in the following ways: (1) by the student’s parent (after obtaining parental consent); (2) by the student’s teacher (after they represent that they have obtained any necessary parental consent); or (3) by the student in the classroom if the teacher elects to provide the student with a unique code. If the student’s teacher is creating the student account, they will have provided certain information, like the student’s name, about the student to ClassDojo when setting up their class that is then used to create the student account. This same information is also used to create the student account on the parent’s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> of their child). If a student sets up the account, they will be asked to enter the unique code they have been given by their teacher (students are unable to sign up for the Service without this), along with a unique username and password. Per COPPA, we may also ask for the student for their age and a parent or guardian’s email address so we can seek parental consent (or notice), as appropriate. We don’t ask students to enter any other personal information to create their student accounts. Teacher and school leader profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school; however, no teacher, parent or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.

                  School Information, Collaboration Features and Content:
                </strong>
                  If you are a teacher or school leader, as part of the profile information you provide, you may choose to associate your account with an existing school or may enter a new school name and possibly your school’s address if we do not have it already. If you are using the Service as a teacher or school leader, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you. By connecting you with your school, the Service may enable and provide additional collaboration features for teachers and school leaders within the same school such as adding photos, videos, and text updates on Class Story or School Story for parents, students and other <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889043" target="_blank">verified teachers</a> in that school to see.

                  As a teacher you’ll need to enter the class year (e.g., first grade) and the names of the students in your class. It is the teacher’s choice what they enter here: for example, teachers could enter John S or John Smith. Alternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the student’s first and last names. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or School Leaders in their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information.

                  As a teacher or school leader, you can invite your students’ parents to join the Service, for example by providing their email address or phone number (to invite them via SMS) within ClassDojo. As a parent, school leader, or teacher you can also invite others to join the Service by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example by email, SMS, or sharing via Facebook or Twitter. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests, and will also treat this as <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703" target="_blank">personal information</a> in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

As a parent, you can also message with your child’s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging as well as through comments on Student Story, Class Story, and School Story posts. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message. Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature, such as <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">Class Story</a> or <a class="depress-on-click" href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103" target="_blank">School Story</a>, any messages, photos, videos or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable parental consent to ClassDojo (or the student’s teacher has represented they have obtained any necessary parental consent)), and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), the student or parent can contact us at privacy@classdojo.com to remove it. We will store messages, including those on Class Story and School Story, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents.

                </strong>
                  Certain mobile applications or “apps” include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.  Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help with “debugging” and for improvement of the ClassDojo App.

                  When you use our Service we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we collect precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We <strong>do not</strong> collect precise geolocation data from students. We will not store or track your device location on an on-going basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geo-location data with third-parties, other than our <a class="depress-on-click" href="#ServiceProviders">service providers</a> as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.

                  Upon request, ClassDojo will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information, and, if you are a user of ClassDojo, you may request access to all your personal information we have on file by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com. In some cases, we won’t be able to guarantee complete access due to legal restrictions - for example, you will not be allowed to access files that contain information about other users or information that is confidential to us.

You may have to verify your identity before you can do that. You may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at privacy@classdojo.com.

We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, even after you update or delete personal information you have provided us from our Service, your personal information may be retained in our backup files and archives for a reasonable period of time for legal purposes or for so long as is necessary in light of the purposes for which such records were collected or legitimately further processed.
