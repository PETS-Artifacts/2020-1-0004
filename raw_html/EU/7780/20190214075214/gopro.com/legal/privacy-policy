<ul>
<li><b>Websites</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When you use our websites (including our web store), we may collect and analyze information about your computer or mobile device such as your IP address, a mobile device identifier (e.g., a IDFA on Apple products like the iPhone and iPad or similar advertising identifiers), browser types, browser language, operating system, the state or country from which you accessed the Services, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Services and upload or post content, error logs, and other similar information. We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the site, and to improve the content of our website to better match the interests of our website users.  </p>
<ul>
<li><b>GoPro Devices</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When you connect your GoPro device (such as a camera) to the Internet or to a GoPro desktop software application (discussed below), we may automatically receive certain information about your GoPro device and your use of it, including camera type, serial number, IP address, firmware version, log files, camera modes, settings, durations, error rates, and other similar usage information.  This information helps us to improve our products and services, troubleshoot bugs, and analyze camera errors.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Mobile Software Applications</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a GoPro mobile application we may automatically receive certain information about your mobile device and use of the application, including a mobile device identifier (e.g., a UDID or IDFA on Apple products like the iPhone and iPad or similar advertising identifiers), operating system, version, IP address and other similar information, such as time spent in different portions of the GoPro mobile application.  We may also collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), as detailed further below. </p>
<ul>
<li><b>GoPro Desktop Software Applications</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Our desktop software, including but not limited to Quik Desktop App may automatically send data about usage of the service or the software when it connects to the Internet. This information will include information about your computer such as operating system, technical specifications, IP address, and data related to your use of the service or the GoPro software on the computer, e.g., number of installs and downloads, screens visited, screen resolution selected, video recording mode, features used, and other similar information.  We monitor customer software usage to help us develop the design and layout of the desktop software and to improve the content to better match the interests of our users.  </p>

<ul>
<li><b>Location Information</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When you install our mobile applications, you will, if legally required, be asked to grant access to your mobile device’s geolocation data. If you grant such permission, we may collect information about your precise geolocation information (i.e., your real-time geographic location), and may use that information to customize the Services with location-based information and features. If you access the Services through a mobile device and you do not want it to provide us with location-tracking information, you can disable the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your mobile device, provided your mobile device allows you to do this. See your device manufacturer’s instructions for further details.  We may also be able to collect location information through your use of a GoPro device.  If so, we will ask you before this information is captured and you will be given the opportunity to turn it off.</p>
<p>Some GoPro devices (like our cameras and drones) have geolocation functionality that enables you to automatically associate your location with the content that you create on that GoPro device.  On such devices you will be asked for your consent to activate the GoPro device’s geolocation functionality. If you grant such permission, any content that you create on that GoPro device will have the location where the content was created embedded on the content file. If you no longer wish to use the geolocation functionality you can disable it in the GoPro device’s settings.</p>
<p><b><u>Information from Other Sources</u></b></p>
<p>GoPro may receive information about you from third parties, such as commerce partners, marketers, social network services, connected TV and entertainment apps, and other parties that we may use to supplement the information that we collect directly from you.  If you connect to a third party network (such as a social network), platform, or service through the Services, you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information (such as name, email address and location) that you agreed the network or other third party platform could provide to GoPro based on your settings on the third party network or platform.  Your agreement takes place when you connect with the third party network, platform, or service via our Services, and/or when you connect with one of our applications through one of these services.</p>
<p><b><u>Anonymous or De-Identified Data</u></b></p>
<p>We may collect data that is already in anonymized or de-identified form or we may manually anonymize and/or de-identify information collected by the Services or via other means so that the information does not identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,159,223);">3.  Cookies and Similar Technologies</span></p>
<p>Please see our dedicated <a href="/cookies">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,159,223);">4. Online Advertising and Analytics</span></p>
<p><b>Online Analytics.</b></p>
<p>We may use third-party web analytics services on our Services, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in the Automatically-Collected Information section above to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party website from which you arrive. The information collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Services. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to online marketing, as described in the following section. </p>
<p><b>Online Advertising.</b></p>
<p>We do not serve third party advertisements to you while using GoPro.com.  However, we do work with website analytics and advertising partners, including Google, Doubleclick Campaign  Manager, AdRoll, Commission Junction and Facebook, to deliver GoPro advertisements on third party publisher websites - these partners may set cookies on your computer's web browser. These cookies allow our partners to recognize your computer so that the ad server can show you GoPro advertisements elsewhere on the Internet, and so that our analytics software can measure your engagement and interactions while using GoPro.com. In this way, ad servers may compile anonymous, de-identified information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw our advertisements, whether or not you interacted with our advertisements, and actions performed on subsequent visits to GoPro.com. This information allows an ad network to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you, and it allows GoPro to optimize the performance of our advertising campaigns and the usability of our website. In other words, we use analytics data in concert with data about our online ads that have been shown using the Google Display Network, DoubleClick for Advertisers, or other online advertising networks. By doing so, we can understand how anonymous users interacted with our website after seeing our ads. </p>
<p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links below in Section 7.  However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.</p>
<p>For more information about these advertising and analytics services and how to opt out, please see the “Your Choices” section below.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,159,223);">5.  Uses of Information</span></p>
<p>GoPro may use the information it collects for various purposes, including but not limited to: </p>
<ul>

<li><b>GoPro Personalization Services</b> – Unless you opt out, we may combine automatically collected information (see Section 2 above) with identifiable information we have collected about you (including your GoPro device serial number and email address).  By associating this data with you personally, we can further personalize and improve the Services for you, such as by providing personalized customer support (e.g., through the combination of your data, we have the ability to access your GoPro device logs to troubleshoot a technical issue you have experienced), delivering in-application messages and promotions, recommending features, and tailoring content and advertising to you. If you do not want us to associate this information with you personally, you may opt out in accordance with Section 7 (“Your Choices”) below.  </li>
<li><b>Order-Related Communications</b> - If you place an order, we will use your name and email address to send you an order confirmation email, a shipping confirmation email, and customer satisfaction emails. If you do not wish to participate in customer satisfaction emails, you may opt out of such emails upon receipt by clicking “Unsubscribe” link contained in the email.</li>
<li><b>Customer Service</b> - Based upon the information you provide us at the time of GoPro account registration or purchase, we will send you a confirmation email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your GoPro account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your preferences.</li>
<li><b>Newsletters, Social Media Campaigns, Special Offers and Updates</b> - We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special promotions, contests, customer satisfaction surveys, events, and opportunities to interact with GoPro and our community. You can sign up to receive these emails and social media campaigns from us on our newsletter sign up page and/or during checkout while purchasing a product. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option NOT to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Your Choices&quot; section below for more details on how to unsubscribe or opt out of these communications from GoPro.</li>
<li><b>Service-Related Announcements</b> - We will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email, push notification, or an in application or web based communication. Generally, you may not opt out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your GoPro account.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,159,223);">6. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</span></p>
<p>GoPro does NOT share, sell, rent or trade information (unless it has been anonymized or de-identified) with third parties for their own promotional purposes, and will only share information as outlined below or with your consent.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Co-Branded Websites </b>- At times GoPro will partner with third party websites in a co-branded relationship, where a co-branded web page(s) is used to promote GoPro products, services, photos, or videos. These web pages may be designed to look and feel just like GoPro.com, but are actually hosted on a different domain. When we enter into co-branded partnerships we may at times share your name and email address in order for GoPro to communicate with you about GoPro related promotions, news, and updates via tools provided by our third party co-branded partner website. Information collected on third party co-branded webpages may not be covered under our Privacy Policy. All information collected on third party co-branded websites is owned and controlled by that website’s privacy policy. Please be sure to read the privacy policy of any website that asks you to submit information.</li>
<li><b>Customer Testimonials - </b>At times, we may post customer testimonials on our website. We will obtain your consent via email and/or opt-in methods prior to posting your name, city, or stated activity/interest along with any testimonial.</li>
<li><b>User-Generated Content -  </b>You may be able to disclose information about yourself in the course of contributing user-generated content on publicly-available areas of the Services, such as your GoPro user profile.  Your GoPro user profile and any information you post there will be publicly available.  This includes, but is not limited to: your uploaded photos or videos, full name, email address, phone number, address, interests, content that you have favorited, and GoPro users whose GoPro accounts you follow.  Your photo or video files may also contain your narrations and captions, as well as data regarding your precise geo-location or information from a fitness device (e.g., your heart rate as you sky-dived) if you have chosen to manually associate this data with your video (e.g., by connecting your camera to a fitness device or by overlaying fitness information on your video in Quik Desktop App). If you share content via hidden URL link, that content and associated data will be accessible by anybody who has the access to the URL link.  Your content will also be shared with users of other social media services to which you have chosen to share, consistent with your privacy settings on those services.   Such information is unencrypted, public information, may be accessed or recorded by us, and there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality in such information.  Any information you submit in the course of such activities can be read, collected, or used by other users. We cannot control how other users of our Services such as Plus, Quik and Awards might use your information. We especially cannot prevent you receiving unwanted messages from other users. If you wish that a specific content generated by you shall be removed from publicly-available areas of our Services, please contact us at privacy@gopro.com.</li>
<li><b>Content Submitted to GoPro -</b> If you submit your video or other content to GoPro, we may publish it on the GoPro website or applications along with certain information about you, e.g., your first and last name or your username, when we have your consent. For more information relating to the terms governing the content you submit to us, please see our <a href="/terms">Terms of Use</a>.</li>
<li><b>Service Providers - </b>We use third party service providers to offer or facilitate services on our behalf, such as a shipping company to fulfill orders, a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services, and an email service provider to send out emails on our behalf. When you order products from GoPro, we will share your information as necessary for such third party services providers to provide the applicable service to us or on our behalf. These third parties are prohibited from using any identifying information about you for promotional purposes. </li>
<li><b>Business Transactions - </b>Information that we collect is considered a business asset. As a result, if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or if we are acquired as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or sale of some or all of our assets, your information may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.<b> </b></li>
<li><b>Legal Compliance - </b>We reserve the right to access and disclose your information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to:  (a) enforce legal rights and comply with the law; (b) comply with an order from a government entity or other competent authority, (c) prevent or address potential or actual injury or interference with our rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage; (d) protect our rights, prevent fraud and/or comply with judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on GoPro.</li>
<li><b>Law Enforcement</b> - We may be required to disclose your information to government or law enforcement officials in response to a lawful request by a public authority or if we have to do so to comply with a legal obligation, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We can also disclose your information in order to apply or enforce our terms and conditions or to respond to any claims, to protect our rights or the rights of a third party, to protect the safety of any person or to prevent or prevent any illegal activity (including for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction).</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be notified when any identifying information about you is collected or shared by any third party that is not our service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether to share your information with that party. If you do not wish to have your information shared and want to opt out from receiving further communications from any third party that is not our agent or service provider, please contact that third party directly.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(0,159,223);">7. Your Choices</span></p>
<p>GoPro provides you with a number of choices with respect to the information we collect and use as discussed throughout this Policy.  Some of your choices include:</p>

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, social media campaigns and promotional emails, you may opt out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or email or by requesting through our contact form located at <a href="/support/">http://gopro.com/support/</a>.  </li>
<li><b>GoPro Personalization Services.</b>  As discussed in depth in Section 2, GoPro may associate the information we automatically collect from you with identifiable information we have collected from and about you (such as your e-mail address or GoPro<b> </b>device serial number) to personalize your GoPro experience.  Such personalization services may include providing tailored content, features, in-application communications and promotions, and personalized customer support.  If you do not want GoPro to associate automatically-collected information with you, you may opt out through your GoPro <a href="/account">account settings</a> by disabling the Personalization tab.  If you opt out we will still collect GoPro device and usage information outlined in Section 2 above, but we will only collect such data in a de-identified and aggregate form.</li>
