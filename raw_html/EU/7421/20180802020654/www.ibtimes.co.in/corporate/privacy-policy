							<h1>Privacy & Cookie Policy</h1>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">INTRODUCTION:</h3>
							<p>This Privacy Policy describes how International Business Times, Inc. ("IBTimes," "us" or "we"), will collect and use your personally identifiable information ("PII") (that is -- your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) as well as data that can, under certain circumstances, indirectly lead to PII ("Related Data").</p>
							<p>This Policy applies to PII and Related Data received by us from consumers when they visit, register or subscribe to the online editions of International Business Times (www.ibtimes.co.in) and related services or sites that link to this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p>From time to time International Business Times may revise this Privacy Policy. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII or Related Data, those changes will be posted in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of the Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices. If we make material changes to our practices regarding use of your PII or Related Data, your PII and Related Data will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which it was subject prior to those changes, unless you have been provided notice of, and have not objected to, the changes. </p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT:</h3>
							<p><b>Generally.</b> When you subscribe to our products or services, we collect PII and Related Information from you. We also may collect PII and Related Information from you when you contact us about your subscriptions or participate in activities like: our resume database; job searches; forums; message boards; chats; submitting a letter to the editor; forwarding an article to a friend; creating a community profile; rating, tagging and commenting on articles; or surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or games. When you visit our web sites, we automatically collect non PII such as IP addresses and web site usage information from you.</p>
							<p>We do not, however, knowingly collect PII from children under the age of thirteen.</p>
							<p>Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, for example via a post card or subscription form. Providing detailed notice in those situations often proves impractical, so consumers will instead be provided with a short notice that describes how to obtain the full text of this Policy and other relevant information from us.</p>
							<p>When you provide PII to us, we will make sure you are informed about the types of uses we will make of the information to the extent it is being used in a manner that differs from what is allowed pursuant to this Privacy Policy.</p>
							<p><b>Cookies.</b> Cookies are small bits of information that our web sites place on the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to, among other things, facilitate our login processes; allow you to personalize and store your settings; collect usage information; determine our total audience size and traffic; and help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest interest to users.</p>
							<p>Third party advertisements displayed on our sites may also contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers. We do not control these cookies and visitors to our web sites should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. (See the <span class="point">"Notice" </span>section below for more information on third party advertisements).</p>
							<p>You can set the browser on your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. However, by blocking all cookies you may not have access to certain features on our web sites. We also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) on our sites in order to recognize users and assess traffic patterns, and we include web beacons and cookies in our e-mail messages, including newsletters, in order to count how many e-mail messages have been opened.</p>
							<p>When you view an ad for our publications on other sites, our third-party advertising company may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. We and our advertising company may also use web beacons (invisible images often referred to as pixel tags or clear GIFs) to note which pages you visit after viewing our ads. The information that is collected through the use of these images is not personally identifiable and is used only to track response to our advertising efforts.</p>
							<p>We may use cookies and similar tools to relate your use of our web sites to PII obtained from you or a reputable third party. For example, if you've asked us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, cookie and/or click stream data about your activities on our web sites may allow us to limit the materials we send you to items we think you will find interesting, based on your prior online activities and preferences. However, if we wish to combine your personal and cookie or click stream information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent.</p>
							<p>Third Party Ad Servers. Some of the advertisements and other services that appear on our web site(s) are delivered to you by Internet advertising companies. These companies utilize certain technologies including cookies to deliver advertisements and marketing messages and to collect anonymous information about your visit to our sites and other web sites. If you would like more information about this practice or to opt out of having this information used by companies that are part of the Network Advertising Initiative to provide targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">NOTICE:</h3>
                    <p>Third Party Web Sites. Our web sites link to web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party sites may be co-branded with International Business Times or other International Business Times logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by us. For example, the Business & Hire section of International Business Times online offers a collection of third party services, such as career counseling, reference checks, recruiter databases and other services, through such links.</p>
                    <p>We're not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our sites or for the privacy practices of third party Internet advertising companies. Once you've left our site via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.</p>
                    <p>Our web sites may also be linked to sites operated by companies affiliated with us (i.e., that are part of the News America Group ("Affiliated Companies"). Although all Affiliated Companies adhere to our privacy principles, visitors to those Affiliated Company sites should still refer to their separate privacy policies and practices, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="txt-orange">USE: HERE'S HOW WE USE PII</h3>

                    <ul class="readers-are">
                    	<li>For the purposes for which you specifically provided it including, without limitation, to enable us to process and fulfill your subscription or other requests</li>

                    	<li>To provide advertisers and ßother third parties with aggregate information about our subscribers, web site user base and usage patterns.</li>
                    	<li>To allow us to personalize the content and advertising that you and others see on our web sites.</li>
                    	<li>To allow other select companies to send you promotional materials about their products and services (that is, unless you've told us not to do so (see <span class="txt-orange">Choice</span> below).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Information about your activities on our sites and other non-personally identifiable information about you may be used to limit the online ads you encounter to those we believe are consistent with your interests. We may combine the information that we collect from you with information that you provide to us in connection with your use of other International Business Times products, services and web sites, or information we collect from third parties.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="txt-orange">Sharing your Information</h3>

                    <p><b class="txt-orange">Special Circumstances: </b>There may be instances when we may disclose PII or Related Data without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of International Business Times, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our web sites; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if International Business Times sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, we may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.</p>
                    <p><b class="txt-orange">Corporate, Third-Party, and Student Subscriptions:</b> If your subscription is provided in whole or in part by your employer or other third party, we may notify the provider when you access or use your subscription.

                    <h1>IBTimes India Cookie Policy</h1>
							<p>IBTimes are committed to ensure that our visitors are aware of how our website operates and its relation to the privacy of customer information. This cookie policy is our first step in educating our website visitors and adhering to new EU/India online privacy laws, as set by the Department for Media Culture and Sport (DMCS).</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">About Cookies</h3>
							<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user’s computer. Cookies store a small amount of data specific to a particular client machine and website. Cookies are widely viewed as being integral to the users browsing experience for the majority of websites.</p>
							<p>Cookies are a convenient way to carry information from one session on a website to another, or between sessions on related websites, without having to load a web server machine with large amounts of data storage.</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">What are the different types of cookies?</h3>
							<h4>Session cookies</h4>
							<p>These cookies are stored in the memory of the computer during a browsing session. When the browsing session is finished, session cookies are automatically deleted.</p>
							<h4>Permanent cookies</h4>
							<p>These are not deleted when a browsing session closes. Permanent cookies can contain information such as user preferences for a website; removing the need to reapply preferences when a website is revisited. One popular use of permanent cookies is for web analytics; measuring visitors and collecting information anonymously, such as the number of pages viewed.</p>
							<h4>Flash cookies</h4>
							<p>Adobe Flash is believed to have a penetration rate of 99% around the world. Websites that contain flash media, such as video or animation clips, can store Flash cookies, also known as Local Shared Objects (LSO’s).</p>
							<h4>HTML5 storage</h4>
							<p>HTML5 storage utilises a new storage medium for client-side processing for saving session information. Values can be retrieved even when a user has closed their browser and reopened it. Compared to cookies, HTML5 storage can hold more information.</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">What do we use cookies for?</h3>
							<p>The IBTimes India website uses a variety of cookies to deliver on-page services to website visitors. Additionally, IBTimes India use analytical products to deliver statistical reporting on how website visitors are interacting on the website. This data is used to improve website performance and continuously develop new content for our website visitors to enjoy.</p>

							<h3 class="txt-orange">Information collected from cookies</h3>
							<p>IBTimes India do not collect any personally identifiable information from the various services used on the website including analytical reporting. Additionally, no information is shared with 3rd parties and analytical data is kept only for internal organisational use.</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">Universally controlling cookies</h3>
							<p>Whilst IBTimes India are implementing a suitable opt-in/out control solution, you may wish to manually control the cookies being placed on your machine. You can limit this to the IBTimes India domain or every website that you visit through your internet browser<br />
								Note: blocking certain cookies may affect the functionality of this website.
							</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">Cookie control solution</h3>
							<p>IBTimes India are currently investigating cookie control systems for use on the website; this would enable website visitors to change their cookie opt-in/out status at any time.</p>
							
							<h3 class="txt-orange">More information</h3>
