Information concerning your responsible use of IoT</strong></h2><p>When you use IoT, we are providing the product to you as a technical service that you may reasonably use. We technically assist you, as a processor, with the use of the platform for your IoT decives. You are responsible for utilizing TeamViewer in accordance with the applicable laws, including data protection laws. The following section explains to you how IoT works.</p><h3 id="iot-personal-data-processed-through-your-use-of-iot"><strong>A. Personal Data processed through your use of IoT</strong></h3><p>When you use IoT, we receive information such as the <strong>amount of devices connected through IoT, <b>log in time and date, functionalities used</b> and <b>metrics</b></strong> entered while you use IoT. Depending on the metrics defined by you in the IoT (the so-called metadata), we also receive data from devices that you connect with IoT (e.g. the temperature of a device or other metrics, as defined by you). While generally such kind of data in and of itself typically includes no personal data, we cannot exclude that you collect information that – either in itself or in connection with additional information – may be linked to individual persons (e.g. maintenance staff for an IoT device). It is therefore your responsibility to ensure that data collection through your IoT devices is fair, transparent and in line with applicable data protection laws.</p><h3 id="iot-data-usage"><strong>B. Data Usage</strong></h3><p>TeamViewer is using all of the personal data described in section II. A. in order to provide you with the functionalities of IoT as agreed in the End User License Agreement and the Performance Specification and in accordance with the data processing provisions in <a href="../eula/?eula=iot#c">section C</a>. of the End User License Agreement where additional information on security measures is available. To improve IoT’s functionalities, TeamViewer uses Hotjar to assist with the diagnosis of technical problems and to analyze user behavior trends. Hotjar is a software as a service tracking tool offered by Hotjar limited, Level 2, St. Julian’s Business Center, 3, Elia Zammit Street, St. Julians, Malta. Hotjar is only activated from time to time, mostly when updates are released. Hotjar collects information about the device that is used to log in to the TeamViewer IoT, such as the device&#8217;s IP address (captured and stored in an anonymized format); device screen resolution; device type (unique device identifiers), operating system, and browser type, geographic location (country only), preferred language used to display the Hotjar enabled site, mouse events (movements, location and clicks), keypressers, referring URL and domain, pages visited, geographic location (country only), date and time of access. The sole purpose of collecting this data is to improve the functionality of IoT. TeamViewer does not store the data collected through Hotjar for longer than 24 hours and masks the user’s private information. The user can object to the use of Hotjar here: <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hotjar.com/opt-out/</a> and can learn about Hotjar’s ability to use and share information through the Hotjar Terms &amp; Conditions of Use, available at <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hotjar.com/terms/</a>, and the Hotjar Privacy Policy, available at <a href="https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.hotjar.com/privacy/</a>.</p><p>We will not share personal data with local authorities or courts except where we are required to do so by applicable law, a court order or a legally binding injunction.</p><h3 id="iot-data-subjects-rights"><strong>C.

No personal data is processed.</p><h2 id="website-remarketing-applications"><strong>H. Remarketing Applications</strong></h2><h3><strong>I. Google AdWords Conversion</strong></h3><p>TeamViewer’s website uses Google AdWords, in order to generate attention for our services by using advertisement on third party websites. Based on data generated by such advertisement campaigns, we are able to determine the success rate of our advisement campaigns. Thereby, TeamViewer tries to provide you with advertisement that is of interest to you, to make its website more interesting, and calculates advertising expenses fairly. Legal basis for such processing of personal data is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Such means of advertisement are delivered by Google through a so-called Ad Server. Along with this, TeamViewer uses Ad Server Cookies, which scale certain parameters, such as display of ads or clicks by users. Provided you clicked on an ad delivered by Google and which redirected you to our website, a cookie is stored on your computer by Google AdWords. These cookies usually expire within 30 days and are not supposed to be used to personally identify a user. In addition to these cookies, analytic values like unique cookie ID, quantity of Ad impressions per storing, last impression and opt-out information (markings that the user does not want to be addressed any further) are usually stored. These cookies enable Google to recognize your internet browser. If you visit certain pages on our website and provided the cookie stored on your computer has not yet expired, TeamViewer and Google are able to recognize that you clicked on an ad and were redirected to the TeamViewer website. Every Google AdWords customer gets a different cookie. Therefore, cookies cannot be tracked across sites by AdWords customers. TeamViewer does not process personal data by and through the aforementioned advertisement campaigns. TeamViewer merely receives statistical evaluations from Google. By and through these statistical evaluations, we can plainly see which advertisement campaign was particularly effective. Any additional data generated by use of the advertisement is not forwarded to TeamViewer; particularly, we cannot identify users through this information. Through the marketing tool, your browser automatically connects to Google’s server. Google has subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield, further information can be obtained under www. www.privacyshield.gov/EU-US-Framework. Please note, that scope and further use of the data processed by Google are beyond TeamViewer’s control. We thus inform you based on our own knowledge: By integrating AdWorks, Google receives information that you visited a particular TeamViewer website or part thereof, and/or that you clicked on one of our advertisements. If you are registered with one of Google’s services, Google is able to match your visit to your Google account. Google may receive your IP address and/or may store it even if you are not registered with one of Google’s services and/or if you have not been logged in. You may avoid tracking in various ways:</p><p>a) Through a setting of your browser software, particularly, by suppressing third party cookie installation that will prevent that you receive third party ads;</p><p>b) Through deactivating AdWorks Cookies, by setting your browser so that cookies from www.googleadservices.com are being blocked; this can be done under <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous</a>, however, such settings are deleted if you delete cookies;</p><p>c) Through permanently deactivating cookies in your Firefox, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome under <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://support.google.com/ads/answer/7395996</a>.

Google Remarketing</strong></h3><p>TeamViewer uses Google Remarketing in addition to AdWords. This is an application that allows us to address you again. After visiting our website and while you are surfing the internet, our advertisement can be displayed to you by and through this application. This is enabled by cookies stored in your browser which track and analyse user behavior on different websites for Google. Google can track your previous visit to our website. According to its own statement, Google does not combine data gathered through remarketing with any personal data Google may have stored about you. Furthermore, pseudonymization is being used as part of remarketing. If you do not want to use the remarketing feature from Google, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://adssettings.google.com/anonymous</a>.</p><h3><strong>III.
