	<h2>Content and site availability disclaimers</h2>
	<p>Every effort is taken to ensure that the information published on this website is accurate and kept up to date in terms of current medical knowledge. However, whilst we only accept information from respected sources we cannot guarantee that all of the information displayed is accurate or complete, nor can we guarantee that it will be suitable for a user's individual circumstances. This website is therefore provided for information only. It is not intended to replace a consultation with an appropriately qualified medical practitioner.</p>
<p>Documents published on the eMC are as regulated by the MHRA or EMA. It is the responsibility of the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to check that their documents are correct and up to date. If Datapharm becomes aware of an error in a regulated document, it informs the MAH. Normally the MAH will re-submit a corrected document to the MHRA or EMA for approval but this is at their sole discretion. If we are asked by the MAH to update the eMC in advance of the new document gaining MHRA or EMA approval we will do so. If we are made aware that advice, warnings or guidance has been issued from the MHRA, EMA or other competent authority which relates to the content of documents on the eMC we will use all reasonable efforts to include a hyperlink from that document to the relevant information on the website of the authority issuing the advice, warning or guidance and inform the MAH that we have done so. The absence of any such hyperlink does not mean that no advice, warning, or guidance has ever been given and users are advised to check with the MAH to ensure the document is up to date.</p>
<p>The inclusion of third party articles or reports in the Regulatory News section of the site or elsewhere does not imply any endorsement of the contents thereof by Datapharm.</p>
<p>Datapharm does not accept responsibility for any loss, damage or injury that arises from the use of this website except to the extent that liability cannot be excluded by law.</p>
<p>We make every effort to ensure that this website is available at all times. To achieve this we do the following:</p>
<ul class="advSearchBullet">
<li class="advSearchBullet">host the site within a fully managed solution monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">use industry standard software for the servers and the website;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">have well developed security arrangements; and</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">have well developed monitoring, maintenance and repair procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>In spite of these efforts we cannot guarantee uninterrupted access to this website, or the sites to which it links. We also cannot guarantee that information on this website will display correctly on all types of browser.  We accept no responsibility for any damages arising from the loss of access to and use of information or the manner in which such information may be displayed by individual browsers.</p>

			<h3 class="normalContent">Information collection and use</h3>
			<p>Datapharm does not collect or store any personally identifiable information about website users, unless you voluntarily provide this information. You might voluntarily provide information when you:</p>
<ul class="advSearchBullet">
<li class="advSearchBullet">contact us - we may keep a copy of the correspondence;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">register to use Datapharm services;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">log into any of the Datapharm websites;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">fill in a form to attend a Datapharm event, meeting or training session; or</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">voluntarily complete a survey for research purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We always aim to ensure that the personally identifiable information that we collect will be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed. Datapharm does not sell personal information it has gathered about you to third parties.</p>
<p>Datapharm may use the information you provide us to:</p>
<ul class="advSearchBullet">
<li class="advSearchBullet">respond to your requests;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">notify you about changes to our services;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and Datapharm; or</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">provide you with relevant information, products, services and training.</li>
</ul>
<p>Datapharm will disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties only under exceptional circumstances:</p>
<ul class="advSearchBullet">
<li class="advSearchBullet">if it is under a legal obligation to do so. For example, if you provide safety data about a medicine we are obliged to pass this information to the company that markets that medicine so that they can fulfil their safety reporting obligation;</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">if third party suppliers need it to perform a contracted role. For example, if a pharmaceutical company submits product information via In-Demand, the NHSBSA may need to contact the pharmaceutical company with questions about the data; or</li>
<li class="advSearchBullet">if we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities in connection with a criminal investigation, or civil or administrative authorities in connection with a pending civil case or administrative investigation.</li>
