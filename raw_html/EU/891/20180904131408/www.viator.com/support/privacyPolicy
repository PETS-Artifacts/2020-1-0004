For example, if you visit Viator by "clicking through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then personal data about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our website or before coming to our website, we may collect information such as your user name and other information made available to us through those services.

In addition, we may collect information about your location with your consent if your Device has been configured to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. For example, we may use your location to show you tours or excursions near you when you are travelling.

To help us do this, we use cookies and similar technologies (together referred to as “cookies” in this policy).</p><p>We notify you about our use of cookies when you first visit our website through a notification banner at the top of the page. By continuing to use the site, you consent to our use of cookies. However, you can change your cookie settings, and choose whether or not to accept cookies, at any time through our Cookie Consent Tool. Further information about managing your cookie settings is provided below.</p><div><h4 class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left">What are cookies?</h4><p>Cookies are small text files that are automatically placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit almost any website. They are stored by your Internet browser. Cookies contain basic information about your Internet use, but they do not normally identify you personally. Your browser sends these cookies back to the site every time you revisit it, so it can recognize your computer or mobile device and personalize and improve your site experience.</p><p>For instance, we use cookies on our website to remember your login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them repeatedly during your visit to the site. Other cookies help us to understand what did and didn't interest you about our site, so we can provide you with features that are more relevant and useful to you next time you visit. We also use cookies to analyze how visitors use the site.</p><p>We work with third party advertisers to give you access to interesting and exciting travel content through our website. So, as well as setting some cookies ourselves ("first party cookies"), we also allow some advertisers who display advertisements on our site to set cookies, known as "third party cookies". These cookies record information about your use of advertisements. This helps advertisers to show you advertisements that are more likely to interest you, limit the number of times you may see an advertisement, and also help to improve your online experience.</p><p>Please note that our use of any information we collect about you through your use of cookies is subject to our Privacy Policy which is linked to at the bottom of every page.</p></div><div><h4 class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left">What types of cookies do we use?</h4><p>The cookies we use fall into 3 categories. These categories are described below. You can find further information about the cookies in each category by accessing the Cookie Consent Tool.</p><div class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left mr-2">Essential cookies</div><p>These cookies are necessary to help you access and move around our site and use all of its features. Without these cookies, our website would not work properly and you would not be able to use certain important features. For example, we use a cookie to keep you logged in during your visit, so the site does not require you to log in repeatedly to access different pages. We also use essential cookies for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</p><p>You will see that you cannot turn off essential cookies through the Cookie Consent Tool. The reason for this is that such cookies are necessary for you to access and use the content and features of the website.</p><div class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left mr-2">Analytics and customization cookies</div><p>At Viator, we want to make your experience on our website as helpful, smooth, and as enjoyable as possible. We use cookies to help us understand how our website is being used and how we can improve your experience on it. This type of so-called "analytics" cookies can provide us with anonymous information to help us understand which parts of our website interest our visitors and if they experience any errors. We use these cookies to test different designs and features for our sites, and we also use them to help us monitor how our visitors reach our sites.</p><p>We also use cookies to save your settings and preferences on our website, such as language preference and information you've previously entered when searching for travel options. Some customization cookies are essential if you want to use certain features of the site.</p><div class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left mr-2">Advertising cookies</div><p>Advertising cookies help ensure that the advertisements you see on our website are as relevant to you as possible. For example, some advertising cookies help select advertisements that are based on your interests. Others help to prevent the same advertisement from continuously reappearing for you.</p><p>We also want to make it as easy as possible for you to share content from Viator with your friends through your favorite social networks. Social networking sites, such as Facebook, may set cookies that recognize you when you view content on our website and allow you to share content across both sites via the use of sharing settings. For further details, please see your social networking site’s terms of use and privacy policy.</p></div><div><h4 class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left">Cookie Consent Tool &mdash; managing your cookie settings</h4><p>You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies, and we explain how you can exercise this right below. We provide you with a Cookie Consent Tool, which allows you to review the first and third party cookies placed through our site and adjust your cookie settings, including whether to accept such cookies or not. You can access the Cookie Consent Tool at any time through the “Cookie consent” link at the bottom of every page.</p><p>In addition, you can manage cookies through the settings of your Internet browser. You can have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, delete individual cookies, or delete all cookies.</p><p>Most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of advertising cookies. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">www.aboutads.info/choices/</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.com/">www.youronlinechoices.com</a> for useful information on how to do this.</p><p>Please note that if you choose to delete Viator cookies, your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be degraded or restricted.</p></div><div><h4 class="font-weight-bold text-sm-left">How you can contact us</h4><p>If you have questions about our use of cookies, please contact us at:</p><p>Viator, Inc.<br>360 Third Avenue, 4th Floor<br>San Francisco<br>California, 94107</p></div></div></article></div></div><footer id="footer" class="bg-dark-blue py-3 py-lg-5"><div class="container-fluid"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-3"><div class="row"><div class="dropdown col-6 col-lg-12 pr-2 pr-lg-3 mb-3"><button class="btn btn-secondary btn-block dropdown-toggle font-weight-normal rounded-0 text-left" type="button"id="languageDropdownButton"data-toggle="dropdown"data-action-capture="click"data-action-tag="click_language_selector">English</button><div class="dropdown-menu z-index-tooltip" aria-labelledby="languageDropdownButton">
