Viator's products and services are made available through Viator.com and Viator-affiliated websites around the world as well as Viator Applications.</p>
 <p>
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Viator.com </strong> (together with other Viator-branded websites) is our flagship website, where we offer our complete range of products and services directly to consumers.</li>
  <li>At Viator we also work with hundreds of <strong>affiliates</strong> (<a href="https://www.viator.com/partnership" target="_blank" title="affiliates">click here</a> to view a partial list of Viator affiliates) who distribute our products and services to consumers through their individual websites. We typically host our affiliates' product-information and booking pages, and manage payment and credit card information.</li>
  <li>We also work with <strong>distributors</strong> (as discussed below) who manage the hosting, purchase and payment for our products and services.</li>
 </ul>
 </p>

 <p>If you provide information directly to our affiliates, distributors or suppliers, the terms of their respective privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy, will apply to such disclosures. You should carefully review the privacy policies of the affiliate partner, distributor or supplier prior to providing information to such third parties. See "Our Affiliates, Distributors and Suppliers" below for additional information.</p></div><p class="text-right pr-2"><a href="#" rel="external">Back to Top</a></p></div><div id="Information"><h3 class="font-weight-medium text-primary text-sm-left">What Information Do We Collect?</h3><div class="information-content"><p><strong>In General</strong></p>
 <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our websites or give us in any other way. We collect two types of information from you on our websites, mobile applications, via email, and through our service providers and distribution partners. Personal Information is information that identifies you personally, such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, postal and email addresses, user name and password, and billing information (such as your credit card number, cardholder name, and card expiration date). We also collect Other Information that does not identify you personally, such as gender, country of residence and other demographic information.</p>
 <p>When you register with Viator, we ask for basic information including your name and email address, and Other Information such as your signup location. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to receive relevant offerings from Viator and its partners and enjoy other benefits of being a registered member. For example, in order to purchase products or services, it is necessary for you to disclose Personal Information, including your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card details and other personally identifying information. If you do not provide Personal Information when purchasing one of our supplier's products or services, we cannot confirm your purchase or facilitate your booking.</p>
 <p>In some instances we may also ask for Other Information such as demographic data, including your country of residence, gender, age, travel habits, etc. We also use cookies (as discussed below) to collect information about the performance and usability of our websites.</p>
 <p><strong>Information About Others</strong></p>
 <p>You may have the opportunity to provide contact and travel-related information for other people through our websites. If you "Refer a Friend" or if you make a purchase products or services for someone else through Viator, you will need to submit that individual's personal information. You must obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information.</p>
 <p><strong>Information from Other Sources.</strong></p>
 <p>We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to other information about you. For example, if you visit Viator by "clicking through" from a site operated by one of our business partners, and you have registered with that partner, then information about you that you have provided to that partner may be shared with us, such as contact information and demographic information. As another example, if you access third party services, such as social media services, through our website or before coming to our website, we may collect information such as your user name and other information made available to us through those services. We will work with our existing partners and potential future partners to improve and personalize your use of our website in accordance with the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
 <p><strong>Automatic Information</strong></p>
 <p>When you visit Viator.com or any of our affiliates' web pages that are hosted by us, our web server automatically recognizes and collects your IP address, which is assigned by your Internet Service Provider and does not identify you personally, web browser software, and referring website. To help us analyze the usage of our websites and related services, and to send more relevant communications to you, we also collect and keep track of Other Information about your online activity, such as content viewed, pages visited, and searches and/or reservations facilitated or made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help us understand the interests and preferences of our users and customize your user experience. For example, if you frequently visit Paris and London, we may send you special notices listing deals and popular products for those destinations. If you are subscribed to any of our email marketing communications - including newsletters and destination alerts, it is necessary for you to disclose Personal Information such as your name and email address and Other Information such as your home country.</p>
 <p><strong>Payment Information</strong></p>
 <p>If you book a tour or excursion with third-party suppliers facilitated by Viator, we will collect payment information from you, including your credit card number, cardholder name, expiration date, authentication code, and billing address.</p>
 <p>We may offer members the option to save information related to method and choice of payment on our websites. If you save such payment details on Viator, you will be able to add, delete, or modify that information at any time in your Account Settings.</p>
 <p><strong>Location Information and Other Information from Devices</strong></p>
 <p>When you use an Application on a Device, we will collect and use information about you in generally similar ways and for similar purposes as when you use the Viator website. In addition, we may collect information about your location if you have instructed your Device to send such information to the Application via the privacy settings on that Device, or if you have uploaded photos tagged with location information. We may use the location information collected from your Device or photos to enhance your use of the Application by providing you with relevant content and contextual advertising. For example, we may use your location to show you tours or excursions near you when you are travelling. You can change the privacy settings of your Device at any time, in order to turn off the functionality to share location information with the Application and/or the functionality to tag your photos with location information. Please note that turning off location sharing may affect certain features of our Application. If you have any queries about the privacy settings of your Device, we suggest you contact the manufacturer of your Device or your mobile service provider for help.</p>
 <p><strong>Your Contributions</strong></p>
 <p>You can contribute to the Viator websites in a number of different ways, including writing reviews, uploading photos, filling out your public profile, and rating other users' contributions. We may store these contributions (your "Content"), publicly display them on our websites and Applications and those of our affiliate partners and distributors, display them to other users, share them with our affiliate partners and distributors, and use them for promotional purposes. Note that if you include Personal Information in your Content, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Content.</p>

 <p><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Viator and its affiliated websites are committed to providing you with relevant content and information across our sites. To do this, we may collect information about your searches and other site activities and use third-party advertising companies to serve ads while you are visiting our websites and we permit these companies to place and access their own cookies on your computer in the course of serving advertisements. Such advertisers do not have access to the information we collect through Viator cookies. To opt out of this targeted online advertising, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies and not ours.</p>
 <p><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> Our websites also may use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>
 <p><strong>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising:</strong> Many of the advertisements you see on the Viator family of sites are served by Viator or its service providers; however, we also allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites, and (2) advertising networks, who collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>
 <p>Please note that we do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies these third parties may use to collect information about your interests, and the information practices of these third parties are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Some of these companies are members of the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Network Advertising Initiative">Network Advertising Initiative</a>, which offers a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies. To learn more, please click <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Network Advertising Initiative">here</a>.</p>
 <p><strong>Response to Do Not Track signals:</strong> Your web browser may transmit a "Do Not Track" ("DNT") signal to Viator and other websites. Because of differences in web browsers' default settings and the manner in which browsers incorporate DNT signals, it is sometimes unclear to site operators whether site visitors have selected the DNT setting themselves, or whether they are aware that they have a choice in determining the setting. Viator does not currently respond to DNT signals. Once the Internet industry has settled on standards related to this issue and Viator recognizes such standards, we may reevaluate this approach.</p></div><p class="text-right pr-2"><a href="#" rel="external">Back to Top</a></p></div><div id="Personal-Information"><h3 class="font-weight-medium text-primary text-sm-left">How We Use And Disclose Your Personal Information</h3><div class="personalinfo-content"><p><strong>We use your personal information in the following ways:</strong></p>

 <p><strong>Sharing with Social Media Services </strong></p>
 <p>If you connect to Viator using Facebook, we may show you reviews, photos and tours that your Facebook friends have posted, shared, saved or purchased on Viator. Note that, if you have Facebook friends who are using Viator, they may also share information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, please review your Facebook privacy settings.</p>

You may also be able to modify your privacy settings with these third party social media websites.</p>

 <p><strong>Sharing with Service Providers </strong></p>
 <p>Some of the Personal Information we collect is shared with our service providers (e.g. tour operators) who are directly involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us. We only provide our service providers with your name and your local contact details, if you provide them (e.g., your hotel name for pick-ups and drop-offs, your local phone number, your mobile phone number, your email address, etc.) We do not provide our service providers with any other Personal Information.

Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
 <p>We currently contract with several third-party online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of third-party marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by such marketing companies in connection with our websites. The information we collect helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html#optout" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Omniture">clicking here</a>.</p>
