<p>We at McAfee, LLC, including our affiliates (“McAfee”, “we”, “us”), care deeply about privacy, security, and online safety, all of which are a significant part of our essential mission: to protect users of our products and services (“you” and “your”) from the risks of theft, disruption, and unauthorized access to their online information and activities. This Privacy Notice (“Notice”) is designed to inform you about how we collect, use, and share your personal data through our website (our “Site”), products, services, and web-based and mobile applications (collectively, the “Services”) or when you interact with us.  </p>
<p>McAfee  sells products and services directly to consumers (you can find more  information about those products here, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/store/m0/catalog.html" target="_blank">Consumer Products</a>&rdquo;), as well as to  corporations and business customers (you can find more information about those  products here, &ldquo;<a href="/enterprise/en-us/products.html">Corporate Products</a>&rdquo;).  This Privacy Notice applies both to the  information we collect from you or your device when you download one of our  Services and to the information we collect when one of our distribution  partners or business customers installs our Services on your device.</p>
<p><a name="privacy_notice_overview" id="privacy_notice_overview"></a>When you access or use our Services, you acknowledge that you have read this Notice and understand its contents. Your use of our Services and the Site and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Notice, any applicable Terms of Service (including any applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes) and any applicable End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>As McAfee grows, our business changes, and we may update this Notice at any time as we deem appropriate to reflect those changes. If there are any material changes to this Privacy Notice, we will notify you by email, in-product notification, or as otherwise required by applicable law. It is important that you check back and make sure that you have reviewed the most current version of this Notice.</p>
<p>This Notice applies to all users of our Services across the world. If you are a resident of the European Economic Area, you have additional rights, which are explained in this Notice.  </p>

<h3 class="padding-top-small">What Kinds of Information Do We Collect? <a id="kinds_personal_information" name="kinds_information"></a></h3>
<p>In order to provide our services, we collect information. Some information you provide directly to us, some we collect automatically through our Services, and some is collected from third parties. In this Notice, “Personal Data” refers to data that could be used, alone or in combination with other data, to identify you as an individual.</p>
<p><strong>We  collect information you provide to us.</strong> For example, we collect information when  you purchase a product or service, create an account, fill out a form,  participate in a contest or promotion, request customer service, or otherwise  communicate with us. </p>

<li>Payment information (including payment card numbers and associated identifiers, billing address, and bank account information); and</li>
<li>Account log-in credentials (which for some Services may include social network credentials).</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also collect other information from or about you, such as information about what products you purchased, your interests, demographic information, photographs and videos, and biometric data such as fingerprints or voice prints.  You may also provide us with additional data.</p>
<p><strong>We  automatically collect information about your interactions with the Services as  well as devices on which the Services are installed.  In some cases, we automatically collect  information about other devices connected to the same network as the device on  which the Services are installed.  </strong></p>
<p>For example, we may collect and use the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about the products you looked at or searched for and the Services you used, including time spent and other statistical information;</li>
<li>Details about your computers, devices, applications, and networks, including internet protocol (IP) address, cookie identifiers, mobile carrier, Bluetooth device IDs, mobile device ID, mobile advertising identifiers, MAC address, IMEI, Advertiser IDs, and other device identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer or device when you access the Internet, browser type and language, language preferences, battery level, on/off status, geo-location information, hardware type, operating system, Internet service provider, pages that you visit before and after using the Services, the date and time of your visit, the amount of time you spend on each page, information about the links you click and pages you view within the Services, and other actions taken through use of the Services such as preferences.  We may collect this information through our Services or through other methods of web analysis; and</li>
<li>Details about your internet, app, or network usage (including URLs or domain names of websites you visit, information about the applications installed on your device, or traffic data); and performance information, crash logs, and other aggregate or statistical information.</li>

</ul>


<p>In  order to provide you our Services, including to detect and evaluate malware and  spam, we may scan, collect, and store data from your files, including emails,  attachments, email addresses, metadata, and URLs and traffic data.     </p>

The Safe  Wi-Fi app includes  McAfee&rsquo;s VPN technology to provide you with secure, encrypted  communications.&nbsp; Data you transmit through Safe Wi-Fi cannot be and is not  read, collected, or analyzed by McAfee. If you are Verizon Safe Wi-Fi customer,  your relationship with  McAfee is governed by the McAfee License Agreement, which can be found under  the License Agreement tab at&nbsp; <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/policy/global/legal.html?tab=license" target="_blank">https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/policy/global/legal.html?tab=license </a> and this Privacy Notice. </p>
<p><strong>Information We  Collect from Third Parties</strong><br />
  We  may receive information about you from other sources and combine that  information with the information we collect directly. Examples of information  we may receive from other sources include: updated delivery or payment  information used to correct our records; purchase or redemption information;  and customer support and enrollment information.  For our identity protection Consumer  Products, we also may collect credit or identity information which we use to  help prevent and detect fraud.   </p>
<p><strong>Location  Information</strong><br />
  Certain  Services may request permission to access your location. Where you grant this  permission, we will collect information about your location using GPS,  wireless, or Bluetooth technology. You can control access to precise location  information through your mobile device settings. We also may look up your IP  address to determine your general location.</p>
<h3 class="padding-top-small">How Do We Use the Information We Collect? <a id="how_use_information" name="how_use_information"></a></h3>
<p><strong>To Help Protect You</strong><br />
 When you install or use one of our Services, it will run in the background of your device or environment to help predict threats and better protect you, your devices, and your information.  For example, McAfee may use information to:</p>

<li>Participate in threat intelligence networks, conduct research, and adapt products and services to help respond to new threats;  </li>
<li>Encrypt your data, lockdown a device, or back-up or recover your data;</li>
<li>Check for Service updates and create performance reports on our Services, to ensure they are performing properly; and</li>
<li>Look for misuses of your data when you use our identity monitoring products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>To Run Our Business</strong> <br />
  We  also use the information we collect for other business purposes, including to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Analyze your behavior to measure,  customize, and improve our Site and Services, including developing new products  and services; </li>

  <li>Comply with and enforce legal  requirements, agreements, and policies.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For Advertising  Purposes</strong><br />
  We  make a variety of products available to our customers at no charge. In order to  keep these products free, we may use information collected through them, such  as what websites you visit or the mobile applications you use, to allow McAfee  and others to show you ads that are targeted to your interests. We do this by  sharing an identifier assigned to your device, together with web browsing  activity or application usage information, with select partners. This  information does not identify you personally and we contractually prohibit the  partners from using the information we provided to identify you. You can opt  out of the use of your information for this purpose in the settings of the  products that include this data sharing.   For more information on which Services contain this feature and how to  opt out, click <a href="https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp/home/articleview?locale=en-US&amp;articleId=TS102592&amp;fromSearch=true&amp;platform=&amp;_afrLoop=752986151615409#!%40%40%3F_afrLoop%3D752986151615409%26articleId%3DTS102592%26centerWidth%3D100%2525%26fromSearch%3Dtrue%26leftWidth%3D0%2525%26locale%3Den-US%26platform%3D%26rightWidth%3D0%2525%26showFooter%3Dfalse%26showHeader%3Dfalse%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dg57watfe9_53" target="_blank">here</a>.   </p>

<h3 class="padding-top-small">Third-Party Advertising <a id="third_party_advertising" name="third_party_advertising"></a></h3>
<p>We  work with third-party advertising companies to display or deliver ads to you  while you are on our Site or using some Services. These third-party advertisers  may collect data about your interaction with the Site or Services or others&rsquo;  sites or services to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize  advertising content. See our&nbsp;<a class="tabNav" data-tabval="cookies" href="#">Cookie Notice</a>&nbsp;to learn more  about how McAfee and these advertising partners use tracking technologies like  cookies and the choices available to you.</p>

<p>If you have consented to allow our Services to access to your location, our mobile advertising partners may use your location to target advertisements to you. You may use the location settings on your device to withdraw access to information about your location.</p>
<p><strong>Other Uses</strong><br />
  We  may use Personal Data for which we have a legitimate interest, such as direct  marketing, individual or market research, anti-fraud protection, or any other  purpose disclosed to you at the time you provide Personal Data or with your  consent.</p>


<h3 class="padding-top-small">Who Do We Share Personal Data With?<a id="when_share_information" name="when_share_information"></a></h3>
<p>Generally, we disclose the information we  collect to provide the Services, to communicate with you, to advertise or  promote our Services, to facilitate changes to or transfers of our business, as  required by law, or with your consent. For instance, we may share the  information we collect as follows:</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>With current and future members of  the McAfee family of companies for the purposes described in this Notice;</li>

  <li>If we believe disclosure is  necessary and appropriate to prevent physical, financial, or other harm,  injury, or loss, including to protect against fraud or credit risk;</li>
  <li>To legal,  governmental, or judicial authorities as instructed or required by those authorities  and applicable laws, or in relation to a legal activity, such as in response to  a subpoena or investigation of suspected illicit or illegal activities, or  where we believe in good faith that users may be engaged in illicit or illegal  activities, or where we are bound by contract or law to enable a customer or  business partner to comply with applicable laws;</a></li>

  <li>In connection with, or during  negotiations for, an acquisition, merger, asset sale, or other similar business  transfer that involves all or substantially all of our assets or functions  where Personal Data is transferred or shared as part of the business assets  (provided that such party agrees to use or disclose such Personal Data  consistent with this Notice or gains your consent for other uses or  disclosures);</li>
  <li>With your consent or at your  direction, such as when you choose to share information or publicly post  content and reviews (for example, social media posts); and</li>
  <li>With persons of your choosing and at  your discretion, should the product you are subscribed to allow that  functionality.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also share aggregate data that does not identify you or any specific device with third parties. </p>
<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights - Shine the Light Law</strong></p>
<p>McAfee does not share information that identifies you personally with non-affiliated third parties for their own marketing use without your permission.</p>
<h3 class="padding-top-small">How Do We Protect Your Data?<a id="security_measures" name="security_measures"></a></h3>
<p>We use administrative, organizational, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the Personal Data we collect and process. Our security controls are designed to maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and an appropriate level of availability.</p>

<h3 class="padding-top-small">What Choices Do You Have About Your Personal Data? <a id="choices_information" name="choices_information"></a></h3>
<p><strong>McAfee Accounts</strong><br />
  If you register  a McAfee Consumer Product, you can access and correct the Personal Data in your  profile at any time by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/site-configurations/external-link/my-account/my-account.html" target="_blank">My  Account</a>&nbsp;or contacting us as described below.&nbsp; If you have not registered a  McAfee product but one of our products is installed on your device, you may  stop McAfee&rsquo;s collection of data from your device by uninstalling that product.  To close your account and for other support questions, please visit the McAfee  <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/home/contact-us.html">Contact Us</a> page and click on Support. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing  Communications</strong><br />
  To stop  receiving marketing communications, click on the unsubscribe link in the email,  or click <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/forms/preferences/communication.html">here</a> for Corporate marketing or <a href="https://home.mcafee.com/supportpages/unsub.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> for Consumer marketing. </p>
<p>If you choose to no longer  receive marketing information, McAfee may still communicate with you regarding  transactional or administrative topics, such as security updates, product  functionality, and service requests.   </p>
<p><strong>Data Retention<a name="data_retention" id="data_retention"></a></strong><br />
  McAfee  will keep your Personal Data for as long as you are a registered subscriber or  user of our products or for as long as is reasonably necessary for business  purposes related to provision of the Services, such as internal reporting and  reconciliation purposes, or to provide you with feedback or information you  might request. </p>
<h3 class="padding-top-small">Children&rsquo;s Privacy<a id="childrens_privacy" name="childrens_privacy"></a></h3>
<p>Some of  McAfee&rsquo;s Services provide security features that parents may use to monitor  their child&rsquo;s activity online, physical location, or use of a registered  device. These Services require parental consent, and we do not knowingly use  the Personal Data we collect from children&rsquo;s devices for any purpose except to  deliver the Services. These products allow parents to delete their child&rsquo;s  profile at any time. If you believe we have collected information from your  child in error or have questions or concerns about our practices relating to  children, please contact us as described below. If you are under the age of 18,  you must have your parent&rsquo;s permission to access the Services. McAfee urges  parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names,  addresses, or phone numbers, without parental permission. If you learn that  your child has provided us with Personal Data without your consent, you may  alert us by contacting us as described below. If we learn that we have  collected any Personal Data from children under 13 (and in certain  jurisdictions under the age of 16), we will promptly take steps to delete such  information and terminate the child&rsquo;s account. </p>
<h3 class="padding-top-small">Residents of the European Economic Area<a id="eea-residents" name="eea-residents"></a></h3>
<p><strong>Data Transfers</strong><br />
  McAfee  is headquartered in the United States, and we have operations, entities, and  service providers in the United States and throughout the world. As such, we  and our service providers may transfer your Personal Data to, or store or  access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide&nbsp;equivalent levels of data  protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your  Personal Data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in  which we process it. If you are in the European Economic Area or Switzerland,  we provide adequate protection for the transfer of Personal Data to countries  outside of the EEA or Switzerland through a series of intercompany agreements  based on the Standard Contractual Clauses authorized under EU law. You are  entitled to obtain a copy of these agreements by contacting us as described  below. </p>
<p><strong>Access,  Rectification, Erasure, and Restriction</strong><br />
  If you register  a McAfee Consumer Product, you can access and correct the Personal Data in your  profile at any time by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mcafee.com/consumer/en-us/site-configurations/external-link/my-account/my-account.html" target="_blank">My  Account</a>. If you have not registered a McAfee product but one of  our products is installed on your device, you may stop McAfee&rsquo;s collection of  data from your device by uninstalling that product. </p>
<p>You may  request access, changes to, or removal of your Personal Data in accordance with  the applicable laws by contacting us as indicated below.  For some requests and where permitted by law,  an administrative fee may be charged.  We  will advise you of any applicable fee prior to performing your request. </p>
<p>Although  McAfee makes good faith efforts to provide customers with access to their  Personal Data, there may be circumstances in which we are unable to provide  access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal  privilege, where the information would compromise others&rsquo; privacy or other  legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be  disproportionate to the risks to the individual&rsquo;s privacy in the case in  question, or where it is commercially proprietary. If McAfee determines that  access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you  with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point  for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, we will take commercially  reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making  any changes to your Personal Data. </p>
<p><strong>For Corporate/Business Customers Only</strong><br />
  McAfee is a data  processor and only processes Personal Data in line with instructions received  from its customers.</p>
  <p>McAfee  will act on written instructions received from Corporate Customers to access,  delete, release, correct, or block access to Personal Data held in McAfee&rsquo;s  products and systems. Any requests relating to access, erasure, or rectification  should be made by an authorized individual using the Individual Data Request  Form available at <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/legal/gdpr-data-request.html">https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/about/legal/gdpr-data-request.html</a>. We will assist our Customers with requests from their employees in  accordance with the applicable data protection laws. </p>
  <p>If you  require further information about the Personal Data processed by the McAfee  product you have purchased, please contact your account manager. </p>
<p><strong>Basis for  Processing</strong><br />
  When we process your Personal Data, we will only do so in the following  situations:  </p>
<ul>
  <li>We need to use your  Personal Data to perform our responsibilities under our contract with you (e.g.  processing payments for and providing the Services you purchase or request). </li>
  <li>We have a legitimate  interest in processing your Personal Data. For example, we have a legitimate  interest in processing your Personal Data to provide, secure, and improve our  Services, in communicating with you about changes to our Services, and in  informing you about new services or products.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Questions  or Complaints</strong><br />
  If you  are a resident of the European Economic Area and have a concern about our  practices concerning the processing of Personal Data that we are not able to  resolve, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the data privacy authority  where you reside. </p>

<p><strong>What Technologies Does McAfee and Its Partners Use?</strong></p>
<p>Like  many services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to do  things like provide and improve your experience and to customize advertising.  The cookies and similar technologies we and our partners use include the  following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are small  files—usually consisting of letters and numbers—placed on your browser or  device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used to help facilitate the  operation of websites, to help them work more efficiently, and to provide  analytic information.</li>
  <li><strong>SDKs. </strong>SDKs  are blocks of code provided by our partners that may be installed in our mobile  applications. SDKs help us understand how you interact with our mobile  applications and collect certain information about the device and network you  use to access the application or the other applications installed on your  device. SDKs often share the mobile advertising identifier assigned to your  device (called &ldquo;IDFA&rdquo; or &ldquo;ID for Advertising&rdquo; on Apple devices and &ldquo;Advertising  ID&rdquo; on Android devices) with our partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Flash Cookies.&nbsp;</strong>A Flash Cookie is a  small data file placed on a computer using Adobe Flash or similar technology  that may be built into your computer or downloaded or installed by you to your  computer. We use these technologies to personalize and enhance your online  experience, facilitate processes, and personalize and store your settings.  Flash cookies may help our website visitors to, for example, set volume  preference associated with a video experience, play games, and perform surveys.  They help us improve our sites by measuring which areas are of greatest  interest to guests.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" target="_blank">Click  here</a>&nbsp;to  learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies. </li>
  <li><strong>Web Beacons</strong>. A web beacon is a  very small clear picture file used to keep track of your navigation through a  single website or a series of websites. They may also be referred to as &ldquo;web  bugs&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear gifs.&rdquo; Web beacons may be used with cookies to gain an  understanding of how a website&rsquo;s users navigate through the website.</li>
  <li><strong>Local  Storage. </strong>Local  storage includes HTML5 local storage and browser cache. These technologies  allow us to store data locally on your browser or device.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What Are My Choices with Respect to Cookies and Similar Technologies?</strong></p>
<p>You  have a variety of choices with respect to the use of cookies and similar  technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can decide whether or not to  accept cookies by using your browser&rsquo;s settings. You may also be able to remove  cookies from your browser. For more information about how to manage browser  cookies, please follow the instructions provided by your browser. Please note  that if you block all cookies, it may affect the functionality of our websites.</li>
  <li>The advertising technology partners  with which we partner may provide you the option to opt out of the use of  information about your website visits and app usage for purposes of serving ads  that are targeted to your interests. You can learn more about interest-based  advertising and how to opt out of the use of your web browsing activity for  interest-based advertising purposes by visiting these sites:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/" target="_blank">Digital Advertising  Alliance</a>,  the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">Network  Advertising Initiative</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.iabeurope.eu/" target="_blank">Interactive</a> <a href="http://youronlinechoices.com/" target="_blank">Advertising Bureau  (IAB) Europe</a>. </li>
  <li>You may opt out of the use of  information about your mobile app usage for purposes of serving ads that are  targeted to your interests through your device settings (called &ldquo;Limit Ad  Tracking&rdquo; on iOS devices and &ldquo;Opt Out of Interest-Based Advertising&rdquo; or &ldquo;Opt  Out of Ads Personalization&rdquo; on Android devices).</li>
  <li>Certain McAfee products are made  available for free. In order to keep these products free, we may use  information about websites you visit or the mobile applications you use to show  you ads that are targeted to your interests. We do this by sharing information  about your device—such as your device and advertising identifiers, together  with web browsing activity or app usage—with select partners. This information  does not identify you personally and we contractually prohibit the partners  from using the information we provided to attempt to identify our users. You  can opt out of the use of your information for this purpose in the settings of  the products that include this data sharing. You can learn more about the  options available to you for particular products and services by clicking <a href="https://service.mcafee.com/webcenter/portal/cp/home/articleview?locale=en-US&amp;articleId=TS102592&amp;fromSearch=true&amp;platform=&amp;_afrLoop=752986151615409#!%40%40%3F_afrLoop%3D752986151615409%26articleId%3DTS102592%26centerWidth%3D100%2525%26fromSearch%3Dtrue%26leftWidth%3D0%2525%26locale%3Den-US%26platform%3D%26rightWidth%3D0%2525%26showFooter%3Dfalse%26showHeader%3Dfalse%26_adf.ctrl-state%3Dg57watfe9_53" target="_blank">here</a>. </li>
  <li>Finally, we participate with the  Facebook Audience Network, which provides a way for companies to display their  ads to Facebook users in apps and websites that are also part of the network.  Facebook helps tailor the ads so that they are relevant and useful. You can use  Facebook&rsquo;s ad preferences tool to view and change your preferences, including  whether you receive these tailored ads, on our website and apps. </li>
