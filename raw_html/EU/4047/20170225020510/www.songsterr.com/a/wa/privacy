    their account. Although most changes may occur immediately, information may still be stored in a web browser’s cache. We take no responsibility for stored

    retain residual information about you in our backup and/or database.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>6. Cookies</h2>
</p>
<p>
    We use cookies to remember your preferences. For this reason, it is necessary that you enable cookies in your browser, and you hereby acknowledge that we

</p>
<p>
    <h2>7. Third Party Websites</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Songsterr may post links to third party websites on its Site. These third party websites are not screened for privacy or security issues by Songsterr, and
    you release us from any liability for the conduct of these third party websites.
</p>
<p>
    Please be aware that this Privacy Policy, and any other policies in place, in addition to any amendments, does not create rights enforceable by third
    parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to members of the Service or Site. Songsterr assumes no responsibility for the
    information collected or used by any advertiser or third party website. Please review the privacy policy and terms of service for each site you visit
    through third party links.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>8. Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Although you are entering into an Agreement with Songsterr to disclose your information to us, we do use third party individuals and organizations to
    assist us, including contractors, web hosts, and others.
</p>
<p>
    Throughout the course of our provision of our Service to you, we may delegate our authority to collect, access, use, and disseminate your information. For
    example, our web host stores the information that you provide us, and we may hire outside contractors to perform maintenance or assist us in securing our
    website.
</p>
<p>
    It is therefore necessary that you grant the third parties we may use in the course of our business the same rights that you afford us under this Privacy
    Policy. For this reason, you hereby agree that for every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that
    we may hire, contract, or otherwise retain the services of for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving our
    website or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be
    held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong
    against you.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>9. Release of Your Information for Legal Purposes</h2>
</p>
<p>
    At times it may become necessary, for legal purposes, to release your information in response to a request from a government agency or a private litigant.
    You agree that we may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith, that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil
    action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give
    you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. We may also
    proactively report you, and release your information to, third parties where we believe that it is prudent to do so for legal reasons, such as our belief
    that you have engaged in fraudulent activities. You release us from any damages that may arise from or relate to the release of your information to a
    request from law enforcement agencies or private litigants.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>10. Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h2>
</p>
<p>
    By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communication with you, such as contact information, you waive all rights to file complaints
    concerning unsolicited e-mail from Songsterr since, by providing such information, you agree to receive communication from us other anyone else covered
    under this Privacy Policy. However, you may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying Songsterr that you no longer wish to receive solicitations
    or information and we will endeavor to remove you from the database.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>11. Security Measures</h2>
</p>
<p>
    We take certain measures to enhance the security of our Site and Service, including using SSL Certificates. However, we make no representations as to the
    security or privacy of your information. It is in our interest to keep our website secure, but we recommend that you use anti-virus software, firewalls,
    and other precautions to protect yourself from security threats.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>12. Your California Privacy Rights</h2>
</p>
<p>
Songsterr permits residents of California to use its services. Therefore, it is the intent of Songsterr to comply with the    <em>California Business and Professions Code</em> §§ 22575-22579. If you are a California resident you may request certain information regarding our
    disclosure of personal information to any third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Various provisions throughout this Privacy Policy address
    requirements of the Californian privacy statutes. In summary, you must presume that we collect electronic information from all visitors. You may contact us
    at <a href="mailto:support@songsterr.com">support@songsterr.com</a> with any questions.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>13. International Transfer</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Your information may be transferred to - and maintained on - computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction
    where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide
    information to us, Songsterr transfers Personal Information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by
    your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.
</p>
<p>
    <h2>14. Amendments</h2>
</p>
<p>
    Like our Terms of Service, we may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will update this page accordingly. You
