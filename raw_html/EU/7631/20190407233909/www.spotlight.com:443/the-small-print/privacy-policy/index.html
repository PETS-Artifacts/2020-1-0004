<h4><strong>Spotlight as your Data Controller<a id="Spotlight as your Data Controller"></a></strong></h4>
<p>Spotlight is your Data Controller. Spotlight has a Data Protection Officer who can be contacted via <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aecacfdacf80dedcc1dacbcddac7c1c0eedddec1dac2c7c9c6da80cdc1c3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fa9e9b8e9bd48a88958e9f998e939594ba898a958e96939d928ed4999597">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or by writing to Data Protection Officer, 7 Leicester Place, London WC2H 7RJ.</p>
<p>We regard the lawful and correct treatment of your personal information by us as very important to our business. To this end we fully endorse and adhere to data protection law across Europe in the form of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the equivalent data protection law in the UK. As your Data Controller, Spotlight has notified its activities to the Office of the Information Commissioner as required under the Data Protection Act 1998, and can be found in the Data Protection Public Register.</p>
<h4><strong>Relationships when Spotlight is not your Data Controller</strong></h4>
<p>If you are a Spotlight Member please note that your agent (if you are represented) or training establishment may also act as your Data Controller both for the supply of your information to Spotlight and its use in submissions made by your Agent on your behalf via The Spotlight Link, and additionally for any third party tools your Agent or training establishment may employ to administer your data. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Agent or training establishment only processes your personal data in accordance with your wishes.</p>
<h4><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy<a id="Changes to this Privacy Policy"></a></strong></h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy was last updated on 17<sup>th</sup> January 2019.</p>
<h4><strong>How do we make sure your data is used lawfully?<a id="How do we make sure your data is used lawfully?"></a></strong></h4>
<p>We will only collect, use, store, share (and any other of the defined uses of <em>processing</em> data) where there is a lawful basis as defined by data protection legislation, and do not collect more information than we need to fulfil the purpose. We document what lawful bases are relied upon for our processing activities. Lawful bases include where you have given <strong>consent,</strong> where processing is necessary for the performance of a <strong>contract</strong> with you, when <strong>complying with law </strong>and where there are <strong>legitimate interests. </strong>More information on how we use these lawful bases is provided below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consent</strong> – In certain situations we can process your data with your consent. Where we process data based on consent, we will ask you for your <em>explicit</em> consent (you have to take an action) which you can withdraw at any time, but it will not affect the lawfulness of processing before then. For children under 16, consent will be gained from the parent or guardian.
<ul>
<li>For example, you ticking a box to receive email marketing communication from us.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Contract</strong> – In certain situations, we need your personal information to comply with our contractual obligations. Where we rely on contract, we will ask you to agree to the use of your personal data necessary for entering into or the performance of your contract with us.
<ul>
<li>For example, by becoming a Spotlight member we will collect information about you so we can deliver the service to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Complying with law – </strong>we may need to process your personal information if the law requires us to.
<ul>
<li>For example, we may have to pass on information of people in fraud or other criminal activity to law enforcement,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Legitimate interest</strong> - We will only rely on legitimate interests where the processing of your data is not overridden by your interests or rights and freedoms. This means that we may need your information and use in a way that can reasonably be expected as part of us running Spotlight and does not materially impact your rights, freedoms or interests.
<ul>
<li>For example, we may use your information to build a more accurate picture of you to better inform our business decisions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>What personal information do we share?<a id="What personal information do we share?"></a></strong></h4>
<p>We sometimes share personal information with carefully selected and trusted third parties. Wherever possible only information contained within your public profile would be released to such third parties. To keep your data safe and maintain your privacy we have the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>We implement appropriate legal, procedural and technical controls;</li>
<li>We only provide the information they need to undertake that service;</li>
<li>They can only use the information for that specific purpose;</li>
<li>We maintain a close relationship to make sure that your data is protected and your privacy maintained;</li>
<li>We mandate that if or when the service stops, they must return or delete any information held.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the examples of the types of trusted third parties we work with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spotlight network partners, circulating breakdown information via their casting platforms in other territories,</li>
<li>Subcontractors assisting us in providing our service to our users,</li>
<li>IT companies who help us deliver our sites and services,
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use Google APIs to help us provide better services to you, such as the Google Places API which enables you to provide consistent location data in a secure and non-intrusive way. Please note that you are bound by Google’s </span><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms of Service</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> when you use parts of our service which are powered by Google.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Third parties who provide service enhancements or additional functionality to our users related to how they use our services.</li>
<ul>
<li>More information: In order to facilitate certain users of Spotlight with their workflow management processes or other functionality, Spotlight may from time to time provide or authorise the use of certain third party software or applications to facilitate additional off-site access to the professional materials and content otherwise available via the Services. An example of this would be third party tools used by Agents to administer their client submissions to casting services alongside diary management etc. Such third party packages or systems should only be used subject to the written approval of Spotlight. You acknowledge that your personal information may be used in this way. Please note however that Spotlight does not endorse and is therefore not responsible for any such third party packages or systems, and Spotlight will not be liable for any loss of information, materials, data or otherwise that may occur due to the use of your information within them.</li>
</ul>
<li>Third parties who are involved in furthering research and technology in areas connected with our service.</li>
<ul>
<li>More information: We are constantly looking for new ways to change and upgrade our Services and functionality. This may involve partnering with selected and trusted research organisations and technology providers to contribute to their research and innovation projects. Often the most innovative developments come from other industries or fields of research outside of our own, and the outputs of the research may have a broader application beyond the improvements from which we directly benefit. As part of this research our trusted partners may be given access to our systems and data and/or be provided with copies of our data, including member photos, video and audio clips, and other professional information from their public profile. In all such circumstances our partners' access to and use of this information will be comprehensively documented and strictly limited to specific research projects that may include benefits for Spotlight and our Services to you, and will be under secure, confidential, temporary conditions, and closed testing environments. Under no circumstances will this information be used for any commercial or live operational activity, other than to develop and test the specific technology and functionality, without your prior consent.</li>
</ul>
<li>Law enforcement in complying with the law, or to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our customers or other third parties,</li>

<h4><strong>How long do we keep your information?<a id="How long do we keep your information?"></a></strong></h4>
<p>We will not keep personal information for longer than it is necessary, and will only retain information for as long as needed to carry out our functions and that purpose. Personal information is retained in line with our retention schedule.</p>
<h4><strong>Where your information may be processed<a id="Your Info Processed"></a></strong></h4>
<p>The information that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) in certain circumstances. For example, if we contract with service providers based outside the EEA, or if any of our servers are at any time based outside the EEA (including 'cloud' service provision). If it is, then we put in place controls to make sure that your information has the same level of protection as if it was inside the EEA. Where we would have to disclose your personal information to third parties, in any circumstances, we will always take all appropriate steps to ensure that such third parties are responsible and trusted and that your personal information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and to European and UK Data Protection standards or equivalent.</p>
<h4><strong>Payment security<a id="Payment security"></a></strong></h4>
<p>We will retain payment details briefly (the duration of time it takes to complete each transaction) whilst purchases are made through our online shop. Payment card details are not stored on our servers beyond this.</p>
<p>Our secure socket layer software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all personal information including credit card numbers, names and addresses. This encryption has the objective of ensuring that nothing can be read as it travels over the Internet to our chosen fully PCI DSS compliant payment service providers <a href="http://www.sagepay.com">www.sagepay.com</a> and <a href="https://worldpay.com/">https://worldpay.com/</a> for processing.</p>
<p>If you experience any payment problems when placing an order via our Site, we advise you to resubmit your payment details. If your payment still fails, please contact your card issuer, to ensure there are no problems with your account, before contacting our customer services team.</p>
