<p>If you contact us electronically, we may collect your electronic identifier e.g. Internet Protocol (IP) address, or device ID or telephone number supplied by your service provider. This information may be used by us and/or shared with and used by our partners to aid in the detection of fraud. Where such data is used by a partner, this will be subject to the partner's own privacy policy.</p>
<p><b>Our suppliers</b></p>
<p>We will sometimes use third parties to process personal information on our behalf. Our partners may do the same when they are processing your personal information for the purposes of providing a quote for comparison. Where third parties process your personal information on our behalf, we will have a contract in place with them placing obligations on them to keep your data secure and only use it for the purposes that we authorise. The third parties that we use may include, for example, IT service providers and market research agencies.</p>
<p><b>Where our insurance partners and comparison service partners collect data from</b></p>
<p>In order to provide you with a quote for comparison, our insurance partners and/or comparison service partners will exchange information about you with other companies and/or carry out checks with various databases. These checks are standard practice in the insurance and financial services industries. Each of our insurance partners or comparison service partner is a data controller in respect of these checks and we are not responsible for those checks. We have set out below some of the common databases that they may check.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Checks against existing records</span></p>
<p>Some of our insurance partners may carry out checks against data they already hold on your (or is held by the company whose brand they administer the product for, or members of their group of companies such as data from existing products, account data or loyalty scheme data. They may use this data to help them assess and rate your application for a quote and determine your premiums. They may also pass this data to their insurance underwriters for these purposes where applicable.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">DVLA</span></p>
<p>Where we ask you for your, or any named driver's, driving licence number, we will pass this to our insurance partners who may pass this to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data.</p>
<p>Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check information to prevent fraud and ensure policy premiums are fair. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or your named driver's) driving licence record.</p>
<p>For details relating to information held about you by the DVLA, please visit <strong><a title="DVLA.gov" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency">www.dvla.gov.uk</a></strong>.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Credit searches</span></p>
<p>Many of our insurance partners will carry out checks with credit reference agencies when they generate a quote for comparison. These checks may include-</p>
<ul>
<li>checks against publicly available information such as the Electoral Register, County Court Judgments, bankruptcy or repossession information;</li>
<li>checks against data relating to your credit history. Credit Reference Agencies share information with other organisations, enabling applications for financial products to be assessed or to assist the tracing of debtors, or to prevent fraud. Our insurance partners may ask Credit Reference Agencies to provide a credit scoring computation. Credit scoring uses a number of factors to work out risks involved in any application. A score is given to each factor and a total score obtained and this together with other factors will be used to assess your application for a quote.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Credit Reference Agencies will keep a record of the search and you may see this recorded on your credit file. The name of the company that carried out the search will be stated on your credit search and if you have any queries regarding any search that has been carried out you will need to contact the company directly. If you want to check the information that the Credit Reference Agencies hold about you then you can contact them directly. The main credit reference agencies are Call Credit, Experian and Equifax.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Claims and Underwriting Exchange and Other Registers and Databases</span></p>
<p>Our insurance partners will exchange information with various databases and registers to help them to check information provided, to detect and prevent crime or fraud and to obtain information about your no claims history. These may include the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, the Hunter Database, the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register, the No Claims History Database and any other relevant industry databases or registers. Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.</p>
<p><b>Publicly available sources</b></p>
<p>We use some open sources of data which are not personal data (such as information about particular geographic areas) and combine this with the personal data that we hold about you (such as your own address). For example, if you request a home insurance quote, we might pre-populate information about your house value from publicly available sources. We will make it clear where we do this and you must check the information to make sure it is correct. This information will be passed to our insurance partners in order to assess insurance risk and provide you with an accurate quote.</p>
<p><b>Providing data about other people</b></p>
<p>You will sometimes need to provide us with data about other people, for example where you request a quote for a policy which includes another person as a joint policyholder or named driver. You may also obtain quotes on behalf of your family or friends. Where you give us data about someone else, you must make sure that you have made that person aware of this Privacy Policy and that they are happy for you to provide their data. Where this privacy policy refers to "your data" this also includes data about anyone else named on the policy or whose data you provide us with.</p>

<p><strong>Part 4 – Other Uses of Data</strong><b><br /></b></p>
<p><i>Marketing</i></p>
<p>When you provide your details you will be given an opportunity to confirm whether you are happy to receive marketing material from us. If you confirm you are happy to receive this material, we will use your postal address, email address and telephone number to send you marketing materials by post, email, telephone call or SMS. We do not pass your data to other companies for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>If you consent to us contacting you for marketing purposes, we will disclose an anonymised version of your email address (we use a process called hashing to protect your details) to third party social media sites such as Facebook to enable us to display marketing to you via such sites. "Hashing" is similar to encryption and means that we scramble the plain text of your email address to create a unique and irreversible message. This means that the social media sites do not receive a plain text version of your email address. Where we do this, we require social media providers only to use your information for the purposes of enabling us to display marketing to you through their site and not for any of their own purposes.</p>
<p>You can change your mind at any time by logging into your account and updating your preferences. You can also unsubscribe from emails by clicking on the unsubscribe link on any marketing emails that we send you, updating your preferences in your account or by unsubscribing on our <a title="Contact preference centre" href="https://preferences.comparethemarket.com/"><strong>website</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This will not impact any communications that we need to send you for the purpose of your quote, for example confirmation of your quote or your account details, notifications we need to send you regarding any rewards you have claimed or communications necessary for any other services you have requested that we provide to you.</p>
<p>Your personal data will also be used to assist us and our approved advertising providers with our advertising activities, as set out in more detail in the "Targeting Cookies" section of our <strong><a title="Cookie policy" href="/information/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-use-of-cookies/">Cookies Policy</a></strong>. Targeting cookies do not collect information that is directly identifiable to you, such as your name, email address and information you enter into forms on our website. They collect information about your browsing activity and your device to enable our providers to serve our advertising to you. Most of these cookies are set by our providers who will be responsible for how the cookies (and information collected by them) are used.</p>
<p>However, we do use the personal data that we hold about you to put you into "segments" based on your interests and needs so that we can ensure the advertising you see is relevant to you. To do this effectively, we need to share some of your information with some of our providers so that they can combine it with the information collected by their cookies and serve advertising to audiences that we select. The information shared is limited to your email address, IP address, information about which products you may be interested in such as which pages of our website or app you have visited or which of our emails you have clicked on and whether you have purchased a policy or claimed a reward with us. Information is always shared in an encrypted, non-identifiable form. Where we do this, we will be jointly responsible with the relevant provider for how that personal data is used. More information about our providers and the cookies used, including how to opt out, is set out in our <strong><a title="Cookie policy" href="/information/privacy-policy/privacy-policy-use-of-cookies/">Cookies Policy</a></strong>.</p>
<p><i>Market Research</i></p>
<p>From time to time we may want to use your postal address, email address and/or telephone number to contact you to assist us with our research by asking you a few questions about the service you have received or by asking if you would like to complete a review of our services. We may sometimes ask market research companies to contact you on our behalf.</p>
<p>If you would prefer us not to contact you for market research purposes then you can let us know by contacting us at <strong><a href="mailto:data.request@comparethemarket.com">data.request@comparethemarket.com</a></strong> or by updating your preferences in your account.</p>
<p><i>Research and Analysis Activities</i></p>
<p>We and our partners use data relating to your quotes, including the personal data you input to request your quotes and information about the policies or contracts you have taken out, to carry out various research and analysis activities to help us to regularly review and improve the products and services we or our partners provide and carry out research. We also share this data with our insurance providers and comparison service providers to enable them to use this data for these purposes. Where possible, data will be shared on an anonymised basis. The data will not be used to make any decisions that will affect you or any other individual and we require our partners and comparison service providers to delete the data as soon as the relevant research and analysis activity is concluded.</p>
<p>We also use the data that we collect about you through your Website usage to carry out research and analysis into usage and activities on our Website to enable us to continue to improve our Website and our products and services.</p>
<p>In relation to personal data used for the purposes described in this Part 4, we process this data because we have a legitimate business interest in carrying out these activities to promote and improve our business. We have ensured appropriate safeguards to protect your rights when processing this data for these purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5 – Special Categories of Personal Data and Criminal Convictions</strong></p>
<p>In order to provide your quotes we may ask you to provide data which data protection law classifies as "special personal data". This includes information about your health (such as any medical conditions). We may also need you to provide information relating to criminal convictions or alleged or actual criminal offences, for example traffic offences, in order to provide your quotes. We will also need to share this data with our insurance partners to enable them to generate their quotes for you.</p>
<p>Where we collect special personal data and criminal conviction or offence data for the purposes above, we process this data because it is in the substantial public interest to do so for the purposes of arranging and/or advising on contracts of insurance.</p>
<p>It may also be necessary for us to retain a copy of any special personal data and criminal conviction or offence data for the purpose of making or defending claims or preventing or detecting crime, including fraud.</p>

<li>You have the right to ask us to provide a copy of the personal data that we hold about you. This is called a Data Subject Access Request or "DSAR". You can access information about your quotes by logging into your account. If you want to receive other personal data that we hold then you can make a DSAR. When contacting us please describe the information you require and make sure that you tell us any email addresses you or anyone else have used to obtain quotes with us as this allows us to trace all relevant information. Please also include the following: your full name, your date of birth and your full address. For security purposes we can only deal with requests where the contact details you provide match the details we have on file and we may need to ask you for further information to verify your identity. If you have changed your contact details or you require information sending to different contact details please include a copy of your passport or driving licence and proof of address such as a recent utility bill to assist us in verifying your identity. We might also need to ask you for additional information to help us locate the data that you are looking for.&nbsp;Once we have all the information that we need to process your DSAR, we will respond within one month unless your DSAR is very large or complex, in which case we may need to extend this period. If we need to do this we will let you know. If you want to make a DSAR in relation to personal data that is held by any of our insurance partners then you will need to contact them directly. You can find our list of insurance partners <strong><a title="Partners" href="/trusted-partners/">here</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate personal data that we hold about you. If you think any of your personal data is inaccurate, please contact us and, provided we can verify your identity and are satisfied as to the accuracy of the correction requested, we will correct the relevant personal data as soon as we can. You can also amend inaccurate data in your account.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to request that we provide a copy of your personal data in a machine readable format or to ask us to send your personal data to another company. This applies to personal data that you have provided to us, which we have processed electronically, such as personal data you entered on our website when you obtained a quote.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You also have the right to ask us to delete personal data that we hold about you. We are obliged to delete personal data in some circumstances, such as where it is no longer needed. However, data protection laws allow us to keep the personal data if we need to, for example if the data is needed for fraud prevention.&nbsp; In any case, we will retain your personal data in line with the retention periods detailed under "How long do we keep data?" above.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If you use the “Your Documents” facility to store your documents, you can delete the documents at any time by selecting the delete option available in the Your Documents section.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to ask us not to do anything with your personal data except store it in limited circumstances, such as if you and we do not agree on the accuracy of personal data and steps are required to validate it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to object to us processing certain personal data about you. However, where we need to continue to process the personal data, for example for fraud prevention purposes, we are not obliged to stop processing it.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>You have the right to ask for significant decisions that have been made about you wholly by automated means to be reviewed. We do not make any significant decisions about you wholly by automated means. However, the nature of the quotes provided by our insurance partners means that they have to use this kind of automated decision making to assess your quotes. If you want any wholly automated decisions in relation to your quotes to be reviewed, you will need to contact the partner who has produced the relevant quote.</li>
