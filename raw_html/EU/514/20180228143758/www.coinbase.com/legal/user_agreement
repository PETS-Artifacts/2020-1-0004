<h1 id="coinbase-user-agreement">COINBASE USER AGREEMENT</h1>
<p><strong>The websites and the services offered by Coinbase are NOT addressed to persons who have their registered office or place of residence in Germany. Coinbase services are provided by Coinbase UK, Ltd., a UK entity. Coinbase UK, Ltd. is not a regulated financial services provider and does not operate outside the UK.</strong></p>
<p>This is a contract between you and Coinbase UK, Ltd, a private limited company incorporated in England and Wales (&quot;Coinbase&quot;). By signing up to use an account through coinbase.com or gdax.com, or any associated websites, APIs, or mobile applications (collectively the &quot;Coinbase Site&quot;), you agree that you have read, understood, and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, as well as our <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/privacy?country=UK">Privacy Policy</a> and E-Sign Consent.</p>
<p><em>Last updated: August 23, 2017</em></p>
<h1 id="part-1:-general-use">PART 1: GENERAL USE</h1>
<h2 id="1.-basic-coinbase-services.">1. Basic Coinbase Services.</h2>
<p><strong>1.1. Eligibility.</strong> To be eligible to use the Coinbase Services, you must be at least 18 years old.</p>
<p>Your eligibility to access certain Coinbase Services also depends on the country in which you reside. The list of Coinbase Services accessible by country can be found at <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/global">https://www.coinbase.com/global</a>.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Coinbase Services</strong>. Your Coinbase account (&quot;Coinbase Account&quot;) encompasses the following basic Coinbase services: One or more hosted Digital Currency wallets that allow users to store certain supported digital currencies, like Bitcoin or Ethereum (&quot;Digital Currency&quot;), and to track, transfer, and manage their supported Digital Currencies (the &quot;Hosted Digital Currency Wallet&quot;); Digital Currency conversion services through which users can buy and sell supported Digital Currencies in transactions with Coinbase (the &quot;Conversion Services&quot;); and a Fiat Currency (e.g. GBP, EUR, CAD) account for use in connection with other Coinbase Services (a &quot;Currency Wallet&quot;) and for eligible users, a Digital Currency exchange platform (&quot;GDAX&quot;) (collectively the &quot;Coinbase Services&quot;). <strong>The risk of loss in trading or holding Digital Currency can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding Digital Currency is suitable for you in light of your financial condition.</strong></p>
<h2 id="2.-creating-a-coinbase-account.">2. Creating a Coinbase Account.</h2>
<p><strong>2.1. Registration of Coinbase Account.</strong> In order to use any of the Coinbase Services, you must first register by providing your name, an e-mail address, password, and affirming your acceptance of this Agreement. Coinbase may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a Coinbase Account, or limit the number of Coinbase Accounts that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Identity Verification.</strong> In order to use certain features of the Coinbase Services, including certain transfers of Digital Currency and/or government-issued currency (&quot;Fiat Currency&quot;), you may be required to provide Coinbase with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update Coinbase if any information changes. <strong>You hereby authorize Coinbase to, directly or through third parties make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), to query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</strong></p>
<h2 id="3.-hosted-digital-currency-wallet.">3. Hosted Digital Currency Wallet.</h2>
<p><strong>3.1. In General.</strong> The Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services allow you to send supported Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store supported Digital Currency from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the Coinbase Site (each such transaction is a &quot;Digital Currency Transaction&quot;).<strong>Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order or to enforce transaction limits Coinbase cannot reverse a Digital Currency Transaction which has been broadcast to a Digital Currency network. The Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services are available only in connection with those Digital Currencies that Coinbase, in its sole discretion, decides to support. The Digital Currencies that Coinbase supports may change from time to time. If you have any questions about which Digital Currencies Coinbase currently supports, please visit <a href="https://support.coinbase.com">https://support.coinbase.com</a>. Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Hosted Digital Currency Wallet services to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies in any form that are not supported by Coinbase. Coinbase assumes no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use Coinbase Services for digital currencies that Coinbase does not support.</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.2. Digital Currency Transactions.</strong> Coinbase processes supported Digital Currency according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to Coinbase. In the event you initiate a Digital Currency Transaction by entering the recipient&#39;s email address and the recipient does not have an existing Coinbase Account, Coinbase will email the recipient and invite them to open a Coinbase Account. If the designated recipient does not open a Coinbase Account within 30 days, Coinbase will return the supported Digital Currency associated with the transaction to your Coinbase Account. Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your Coinbase Account balance or be available to conduct transactions. Coinbase may charge network fees (miner fees) to process a Digital Currency transaction on your behalf. Coinbase will calculate the network fee in its discretion, although Coinbase will always notify you of the network fee at or before the time you authorize the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>3.3. Digital Currency Storage &amp; Transmission Delays.</strong> Coinbase securely stores all Digital Currency private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for Coinbase to retrieve certain information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transaction in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Currency Transaction for 48 hours or more. You acknowledge and agree that a Digital Currency Transaction facilitated by Coinbase may be delayed.</p>
<p><strong>3.4. Third Party Payments.</strong> Coinbase has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of Coinbase Services). Coinbase is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you may transact with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with Digital Currency transferred using the Coinbase Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must resolve the dispute directly with that third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify Coinbase Support at <a href="mailto:trust@coinbase.com">trust@coinbase.com</a> so that we may consider what action to take, if any.</p>
<p><strong>3.5. Coinbase Vault</strong>. You may elect to use the Coinbase Vault to store supported Digital Currency. The Coinbase Vault allows users to set withdrawal time-delays and/or to require the electronic approval of multiple individuals designated by the user before transfers may be completed. Coinbase also offers an advanced Vault which allows users the option to view, control, and distribute private keys of associated Digital Currency to multiple third parties whose majority approval will be required to transfer associated Digital Currency (the &quot;Multisig Vault&quot;). <strong>Coinbase cannot restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys which are not within Coinbase&#39;s control. If you use the Multisig Vault you acknowledge that Coinbase is not responsible for transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining private keys and/or Digital Currency associated with the Vault.</strong> If you and/or co-signing authorities lose, mishandle, or have stolen associated Digital Currency private keys, or if your cosigners refuse to provide requisite authority, you acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated Digital Currency, and that Coinbase is not responsible for such loss.</p>
<p><strong>3.6. Customized Coinbase Payment Page.</strong> In some cases, you may establish a customizable payment page (&quot;Payment Page&quot;) which will allow others to easily send Digital Currency to your Coinbase Account. You may establish and customize your Payment Page through your Coinbase Account settings, which will allow you to establish a user handle and associated Payments Page URL, upload a photo, and provide a short description. In establishing your Payment Page and uploading or adding any text, photo, or other material, you agree that you will not (<em>i</em>) post misleading materials or misappropriate the identity of another person or entity, (<em>ii</em>) post any copyrighted material which you are not authorized to post, or (<em>iii</em>) post any profane, unlawful, or offensive materials. Coinbase, in its sole discretion, may disable your Payment Page and take other action in accordance with this Agreement if we believe you are in violation of the foregoing or abusing this service. Coinbase may reclaim user handles associated with dormant Coinbase Accounts. Coinbase does not guarantee or endorse the purported identity, message, or other information posted by a user to the user&#39;s Payment Page.</p>
<p><strong>3.7 Advanced Protocols.</strong> Unless specifically announced on our website or through some other official public statement of Coinbase, we do not support metacoins, colored coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins which supplement or interact with a Digital Currency supported by Coinbase (collectively, “Advanced Protocols”). Do not use your Coinbase Account or GDAX account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction involving an Advanced Protocol. The Coinbase platform is not configured to detect and/or secure Advanced Protocol transactions and Coinbase assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect to Advanced Protocols.</p>
<p><strong>3.8 Operation of Digital Currency Protocols.</strong> Coinbase does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. By using the Coinbase or GDAX platforms, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Coinbase is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols and that Coinbase makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability; and (ii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (a/k/a “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or even the name of the Digital Currency you store in the Coinbase platform. In the event of a fork, you agree that Coinbase may temporarily suspend Coinbase operations (with or without advance notice to you) and that Coinbase may, in its sole discretion, decide whether or not to support (or cease supporting) either branch of the forked protocol entirely. You acknowledge and agree that Coinbase assumes absolutely no responsibility whatsoever in respect of an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.</p>
<h2 id="4.-conversion-services.">4. Conversion Services.</h2>
<p><strong>4.1. In General.</strong> Eligible users in certain jurisdictions may buy or sell supported Digital Currency through the Conversion Services. The Conversion Services are subject to the Coinbase &quot;Conversion Rate&quot; for the given transaction. &quot;Conversion Rate&quot; means the price of a given supported Digital Currency amount in terms of Fiat Currency or other Digital Currency as quoted on the Coinbase Site. The Conversion Rate is stated either as a &quot;Buy Price&quot; or as a &quot;Sell Price,&quot; which is the price in terms of Fiat Currency or Digital Currency at which you may buy or sell supported Digital Currency to Coinbase. You acknowledge that the Buy Price Conversion Rate may not be the same as the Sell Price Conversion Rate at any given time, and that Coinbase may add a margin or “spread” to the quoted Conversion Rate. You agree, as a condition of using any Coinbase Conversion Services, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric. Coinbase reserves the right to delay any Conversion Service transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. Coinbase does not guarantee the availability of its Conversion Service, and the act of purchasing supported Digital Currency from Coinbase does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your supported Digital Currency to Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>4.2. Purchase Transactions.</strong> After successfully completing the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-2:-verification-procedures-and-limits">Verification Procedures</a>, you may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method. You authorize Coinbase to initiate debits from your selected payment method(s) in settlement of purchase transactions. A <strong>Conversion Fee</strong> (defined below) applies to all purchase transactions. Although Coinbase will attempt to deliver supported Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before Digital Currency is delivered to your Coinbase Account. We will make best efforts to fulfill all transactions, but in the rare circumstance where Coinbase cannot fulfill your purchase order, we will notify you and seek your approval to fulfill the purchase order at the contemporaneous Buy Price Conversion Rate. To secure the performance of your obligations under this Agreement, you grant to Coinbase a lien on and security interest in and to the balances in your account.</p>
<p><strong>4.3. Sale Transactions.</strong> After successfully completing the <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement?country=uk#appendix-2:-verification-procedures-and-limits">Verification Procedures</a>, you may sell supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method. You authorize Coinbase to debit your Coinbase Account(s) and initiate payments to your selected payment method(s) in settlement of sell transactions. An applicable Conversion Fee (defined below) applies to all sale transactions. Your receipt of funds will depend on the payment type, and may take up to three or more business days.</p>
<p><strong>4.4. Conversion Fees.</strong> Each Conversion Service transaction is subject to a fee (a &quot;Conversion Fee&quot;). The applicable Conversion Fee is displayed to you on the Coinbase Site prior to you completing a Conversion Service transaction. Coinbase will not process a conversion transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees, such as wire transfer fees, would exceed the value of your transaction. Payments using other methods not described below, such as wire (if permitted), are subject to different transaction fees disclosed to you before you authorize the transaction.The availability of each Payment Method depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to your location, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.</p>
<p>You can view the current fee applicable to your location and payment method at our <a href="https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees">Fees page</a>.</p>
<p>Coinbase reserves the right to adjust its Conversion Fees and any applicable waivers at any time. We will always notify you of the Conversion Fee which applies to your transaction, both at the time of the transaction and in each receipt we issue to you.</p>
<p><strong>4.5. Reversals; Cancellations.</strong> You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds, you authorize Coinbase, in its sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including Coinbase balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider. <strong>Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales of Digital Currency in its sole discretion, even after funds have been debited from your account(s), if Coinbase suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime; in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order; if Coinbase reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous; or if Coinbase suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below. In such instances, Coinbase will reverse the transaction and we are under no obligation to allow you to reinstate a purchase or sale order at the same price or on the same terms as the cancelled transaction.</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.7. Payment Services Partners.</strong> Coinbase may use a third party payment processor to process any Fiat Currency payment between you and Coinbase, including but not limited to payments in relation to your use of the Conversion Service or deposits or withdrawals from your Currency Wallet or GDAX Account.</p>
<h2 id="5.-currency-wallet.">5. Currency Wallet.</h2>
<p><strong>5.1. Currency Wallets.</strong> Certain approved users may establish and fund one or more Currency Wallets to facilitate transactions on the Coinbase or GDAX platforms. You are the owner of the balance of each of your Currency Wallets. Coinbase holds the balance of your Currency Wallets in dedicated custodial accounts with financial institutions. All funds held in a Currency Wallet are held on trust by Coinbase for the benefit of the user, or by a licensed Electronic Money Institution on behalf of the user.</p>
<p><strong>5.2. Deposits and Withdrawals.</strong> You may initiate a transfer from your linked bank account to fund a Currency Wallet. Fees may apply to deposits and withdrawals from your Currency Wallet. All fees will be clearly disclosed in your Coinbase account and at <a href="https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees">https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/2109597-buy-sell-bank-transfer-fees</a>.</p>
<p>For deposits, Coinbase will credit your Currency Wallet a corresponding amount of Fiat Currency after funds are delivered to Coinbase, typically within two to three business days after you authorize a deposit. For withdrawals, Coinbase will immediately debit your Currency Wallet when you authorize a withdrawal and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. Bank fees are netted out of transfers to or from Coinbase. We will not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.</p>

<h1 id="part-2.-additional-terms-for-merchants">PART 2. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR MERCHANTS</h1>
<h2 id="1.-merchant-services.">1. Merchant Services.</h2>
<p><strong>1.1. Merchant Services.</strong> Users who intend to sell goods and/or services (each, a &quot;Merchant&quot;) and who wish to accept Digital Currency from purchasers as a method of payment may use a suite of tools and related services for this purpose (the &quot;Merchant Services&quot;). Through the Merchant Services, Coinbase enables Merchants to accept Digital Currency from customers as a method of payment, and processes the transfer of Digital Currency to Merchants from their customers. Merchants may also sell Digital Currency to, or buy Digital Currency from, Coinbase, and otherwise utilize the Coinbase Services, in the same manner as any other user. Use of Merchant Services is subject to this Part 2 and is also subject to General Use terms, including without limitation the releases, indemnities, disclaimers, limitations of liability, prohibited use, dispute resolution, and cancellation policies set forth above.</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Merchant Profile.</strong> Each Merchant user is required to provide accurate information necessary to complete a merchant profile associated with the user&#39;s Coinbase Account. This information may include business name, address and other contact information, website URL, taxpayer or other government ID, corporate documents, and other information Coinbase may request. Coinbase may limit Merchant transaction volumes depending on (<em>i</em>) the Merchant&#39;s historical activity on Coinbase, (<em>ii</em>) satisfactory completion of a Merchant profile; (<em>iii</em>) satisfaction of reasonable requests for additional information; (<em>iv</em>) perceived risks; (<em>v</em>) repeated customer complaints; and/or (<em>vi</em>) any indication that the Merchant has violated this Agreement. Newly on-boarded Merchants may be required to submit to additional verification procedures as necessary to verify that the Merchant operates a legitimate business.</p>
<h2 id="2.-merchant-transactions-and-settlement.">2. Merchant Transactions and Settlement.</h2>
<p><strong>2.1. Transaction Confirmation.</strong> Coinbase will provide users of Merchant Services with an order notification indicating when or whether the Merchant has been paid by its customer.</p>
<p><strong>2.2. Completed Order Notifications.</strong> Upon Merchant&#39;s customer&#39;s submission of a valid and completed payment through Merchant Services, Coinbase will send a callback to Merchant&#39;s designated callback URL to confirm successful transfer of the customer&#39;s payment to Merchant—so designated as a &quot;completed&quot; order. Except on suspicion of fraud, error, or abusive use, Coinbase will not reverse a payment and/or corresponding Digital Currency credit which it has designated as completed.</p>
<p><strong>2.3. Timing of Completed Order.</strong> If the Merchant&#39;s customer uses a Hosted Digital Currency Wallet to successfully initiate its purchase, Coinbase will issue the completed callback order immediately to the Merchant. If the Merchant&#39;s customer does not use a Hosted Digital Currency Wallet to effect its purchase, Coinbase will initiate an order status callback when Coinbase detects that the corresponding Digital Currency transaction has been confirmed by the corresponding Digital Currency network.</p>
<p><strong>2.4. Mispaid Order Notifications.</strong> A callback may also indicate an order status as &quot;mispaid,&quot; meaning Coinbase has detected transfer of an amount of Digital Currency which does not correspond with the Digital Currency Price and/or that the customer transferred Digital Currency after expiration of a checkout window. &quot;Mispaid&quot; orders may result in transfer of Digital Currency to Merchant&#39;s Coinbase Wallet for further processing by Merchant in accordance with Merchant&#39;s refund and order processing policies, but shall not be deemed completed by Coinbase.</p>
<p><strong>2.5 Limitations.</strong> Coinbase may delay order verifications if Merchant has not provided its legal name, logo, website, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, designation of business location and type. Until completion of such applicable verification procedures, newly-boarded Merchants may experience delayed processing of Digital Currency Transactions or Conversion Service transactions. Coinbase will designate any such delayed transaction as &quot;pending,&quot; and funds will not be available in the Merchant&#39;s Coinbase Account and/or Currency Account until the pending transaction is completed. Coinbase reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel, or to reverse any Merchant transaction (<em>i</em>) as required by law, (<em>ii</em>) in response to a facially valid subpoena, court order, or other government order, or (<em>iii</em>) if Coinbase reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous, or related to <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business</a> as defined in the User Agreement.</p>
<p><strong>2.6. Instant Conversion.</strong> Merchants who have successfully linked a payout method to their Coinbase Account may use the Instant Conversion Service. The Instant Conversion Service will allow Merchants to designate the price of their goods and services in Fiat Currency and customers to pay for their purchases from such Merchant in Digital Currency based on the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted by Coinbase on the Coinbase Site and displayed to the customer at the time that the customer approves the purchase. In connection with the Instant Conversion Service, the Merchant, as merchant of record for each transaction, shall: (<em>i</em>) use Coinbase to calculate an appropriate amount of Digital Currency (a &quot;Digital Currency Price&quot;) to be transferred to Merchant as payment for a good or service with reference to the Sell Price Conversion Rate at the time Merchant&#39;s customer visits the Merchant&#39;s checkout page; Coinbase will lock the Digital Currency Price for a period of time, but if the customer does not initiate a transfer within a certain payment window, Coinbase will recalculate the Digital Currency Price based on an updated Sell Price Conversion Rate; (<em>ii</em>) accept Digital Currency into its corresponding Hosted Digital Currency Wallet; (<em>iii</em>) immediately sell such Digital Currency to Coinbase using the Instant Conversion Service, and (<em>iv</em>) subsequently receive the proceeds from such Digital Currency sale transaction from Coinbase in the relevant Fiat Currency in an amount equal to the original price of the item in the applicable Fiat Currency, less applicable fees. By using this service, Coinbase guarantees that regardless of any change in the price of Digital Currency between the time of purchase and settlement, the Merchant will receive the fixed purchase price as designated by the Merchant in Fiat Currency at the time the customer approved the purchase, less applicable fees.</p>
<p><strong>2.7 Settlement.</strong> Settlements to Merchant in connection with the Merchant&#39;s sale of Digital Currency to Coinbase will generally take a minimum of two to three business days, following Coinbase&#39;s transmission to Merchant of confirmation of the relevant transaction, although exceptions may apply.</p>
<h2 id="3.-release,-restrictions,-and-general-use.">3. Release, Restrictions, and General Use.</h2>
<p><strong>3.1 Merchant Transactions.</strong> Each Merchant acknowledges and agrees that Coinbase has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that the Merchant may sell to customers using the Coinbase Services. Each Merchant is responsible for handling customer inquiries related to the goods and/or services it sells to customers through the Coinbase Services, except for inquiries related to payment for such goods or services which will be handled by Coinbase. Each Merchant warrants that it will not use any Coinbase Services in connection with any <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/legal/user_agreement#appendix-1:-prohibited-businesses-and-prohibited-use">Prohibited Use or Business</a>, as described herein. Each Merchant confirms that by opening a Coinbase Account, the Merchant will not use the Coinbase Services to accept payments in connection with any of the Prohibited Businesses. Each Merchant further warrants that it will not use Coinbase Services in connection with transactions which involve pre-payment of an order which the Merchant does not intend to fulfill within thirty (30) days. When a Merchant must issue a refund to a customer, Coinbase will debit the Merchant&#39;s Hosted Digital Currency Wallet for the relevant amount of Digital Currency (or, in the event the Merchant uses the Instant Conversion Service, the Merchant shall purchase the relevant amount of Digital Currency in Fiat Currency before Digital Currency is debited from the Merchant&#39;s Hosted Digital Currency Wallet) and provide a refund to the customer in Digital Currency having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in Fiat Currency, based on the then current Conversion Rate.</p>
<p><strong>3.2. Obligations of Merchants.</strong> In addition to the obligations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, Merchants agree to:</p>
<p>(a) At all times maintain all licenses, registrations, authorizations and approvals required to operate their business, conduct all activities related thereto, and utilize the Coinbase Services in connection therewith.</p>
<p>(b) Ensure that all aspects of their business, including (i) all Merchant activities, and the activity of any third party engaged by the Merchant, (ii) the goods and services offered for sale by Merchant, and (iii) the acts or omissions of each Merchant in connection with their use of Coinbase Services comply with applicable law at all times.</p>
<p>(c) Promptly provide, and cause third parties under its control to promptly provide, such information as Coinbase may request from time to time regarding (i) the Merchant, its policies, procedures, and activities, (ii) any good or service offered for sale and for which the Merchant may accept payment by use of Coinbase Services, or (iii) any transaction conducted through the use of Coinbase Services, to the extent Coinbase deems such information reasonably necessary to comply with its policies or procedures, applicable law, an audit, or the guidance or direction of, or request from, any regulatory authority or financial institution.</p>
<p>(d) Within the Coinbase-hosted payment page, accurately identity the sale item in the Item Name field and provide an accurate and succinct description of the same sale item in the Item Description Field.</p>
<p>(e) Authorize Coinbase to, directly or through third parties, (<em>i</em>) make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or account information, and (<em>ii</em>) request and obtain any consumer report, credit report or similar information relating to you and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports, and hereby authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.</p>

You have no rights with respect to Developer&#39;s Tools or Coinbase Marks except as expressly set forth herein.

<h2 id="4.-api-calls-and-compliance">4. API Calls and Compliance</h2>
<p>Coinbase may set limits on the number of API calls that you can make at its sole discretion, for example in the interest of service stability. If you exceed these limits, Coinbase may moderate your activity or cease offering you access to the Coinbase APIs altogether in Coinbase&#39;s sole discretion. You agree to such limitations and will not attempt to circumvent such limitations. Coinbase may immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Developer&#39;s Tools without notice if Coinbase believes, in its sole discretion, that you are in violation of this Agreement or the Terms.</p>
<h2 id="5.-updates-and-support">5. Updates and Support</h2>
<p>Coinbase may elect to provide you with support or modifications for the Developer&#39;s Tools, in its sole discretion, and may terminate such support at any time without notice.

<h2 id="6.-security-and-privacy">6. Security and Privacy</h2>
<p><strong>6.1 Security.</strong> You will use all reasonable efforts to protect Customer Data (as defined below) collected by your Application, including without limitation any personally identifiable information (&quot;PII&quot;), from unauthorized access or use. In the event your systems or infrastructure that are used for storage, processing or hosting Customer Data are breached or compromised, or if Customer Data is inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify Coinbase promptly of such a breach or exposure including root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future. You are responsible for providing customer notification under the state breach notification statutes and any other applicable privacy laws and you will bear the costs incurred by Coinbase resulting from your breach or exposure. You acknowledge that you are solely responsible for any personal injury or property damage arising from or relating to your use of any Developer&#39;s Tools or any authorized or unauthorized use of your Application.</p>
<p><strong>6.2. Privacy and PII.</strong> &quot;Customer Data&quot; means any and all technical information, PII, device usage information, or other information derived from access to or use of any of the Developer&#39;s Tools, including but not limited to data that relates to any end users of any Coinbase products or services or pertains to use of any Coinbase products or services by such end users. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for obtaining all required consents from end users in connection with any use of your Application and the Developer&#39;s Tools, which consent shall be compliant with all applicable data protection legislation and other privacy laws, rules, and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting any Customer Data or other information from end users of your Application, you must provide adequate notice of what Customer Data and other information you collect and how it will be used and/or shared and obtain any necessary consents. You and your Application will comply with all privacy laws and regulations (including those applying to PII) in connection with your access and use of the Developer&#39;s Tools. You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your Application that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all end users of your Application, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to end users of your Application what data and user information you collect (such as PII, login information, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for advertising) with Coinbase and third parties. If a user requests of you or Coinbase to have any Customer Data that may be considered PII under any law, rule, or regulation throughout the world deleted, you agree to promptly honor the user&#39;s or Coinbase&#39;s request and to delete all such data and information from your servers and other assets, including back-ups, to the extent reasonably possible, or to anonymize all user data so it cannot be tied back to a user&#39;s identity.</p>
<p><strong>6.3. Data Use.</strong> You will not sell any Customer Data or disclose any Customer Data to any third party. Your Application may use Customer Data only as required for use and access to your Application by the end user to whom such Customer Data relates. You shall not sublicense the Customer Data to any third party, and you shall not use or disclose any information derived directly or indirectly from the Customer Data for any purpose other than as set forth above. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you shall not use any part of the Customer Data to create a database separate from your Application or transmit all or part of the Customer Data to any third party for any use separate from your Application. Any use of Customer Data other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement is strictly prohibited.</p>
