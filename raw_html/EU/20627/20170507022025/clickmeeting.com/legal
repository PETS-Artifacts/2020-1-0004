    <h2>User Data Processing</h2>
    <p>ClickMeeting collects personal information from Users who visit this Site and register with our Service. ClickMeeting is a data controller with respect to the User's data. Because of the nature of our Service we must collect from Users personal information such as (at the minimum): (i) first and last name, (ii) username, (iii) an email address to be used as a login, (iv) password, (v) billing information such as billing address and credit card information where necessary, (vi) phone, (vii) country, (viii) address, city, state, zip.</p>

ClickMeeting uses the User's registration information to authenticate Users and provide access to the Service.

From time to time, ClickMeeting may contact the User via email to notify them of changes to its Service and scheduled maintenance.</p>
    <p>The User agrees and acknowledges that their information collected through our websites and related Services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in any of the countries around the world in which ClickMeeting maintains offices and data centers, including the United States. As for the countries from outside of the European Economic Area, ClickMeeting shall cooperate only with entities from countries which ensure an adequate level of personal data protection. </p>
    <p>Information that is provided by meeting organizers such as: User name, email address and any other business contact and meeting subject contact are considered confidential to the User. When the Participant registers with one of our Users for an online transmission, that information is provided to the User. ClickMeeting may store that information to fulfill our obligations to our Users. ClickMeeting will not use the information to send marketing information for ClickMeeting services or third party offers to the Participants. The User and Participants should be aware that any personal information they submit while in-session and chatting can be read, collected or used by the User and other Participants. ClickMeeting will not view information except as necessary to appropriately support the Service.</p>
    <p>Provision of personal data in connection with the use of the Service is voluntary. Note, however, that the refusal to provide certain data may make it impossible for the User to use all or part of the Service functionalities.</p>
    <p>The User is obliged to update the data provided in the registration form as soon as any change in these data has occurred.</p>
</div>

<div id="GroupASub2" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Outsourcing of Participants Personal Data Processing</h2>
    <p>ClickMeeting recognizes the importance of respecting the privacy of Participants who decided to entrust their sensitive information with the User. We make every effort to safeguard their security. ClickMeeting will never use the information about the Participants you collect within our Service to send any information other than expressly provided by you, nor will we share it with or sell it to anyone else for such use.</p>
    <p>The User acknowledges and agrees that by virtue of his role as an online meeting organizer, he is a personal data base administrator or a data processor in terms of personal data of the Participants and is solely responsible to fulfill his duties pursuant to the Act.</p>
    <p>Participant's personal data processing may be outsourced by the User to ClickMeeting only where the User is the data controller (within the meaning of Article 7 item 4 of the Act) or where the latter processes such personal data on the basis of Article 31 of the Act (as a data processor).</p>
    <p>ClickMeeting may process Participants data within its capacity of data processor as set out in Article 31 of the Act.</p>
    <p>Participants data processing may be outsourced as regards email address and other Participant-related information considered by the User necessary to ensure proper provision of the Service.</p>
    <p>Further passing of the job of data processing may take place only within the limits, and for the purpose of proper provision, of the Service.</p>
    <p>As for the countries from outside of the European Economic Area, ClickMeeting shall cooperate only with entities from countries which ensure an adequate level of personal data protection.</p>
    <p>ClickMeeting declares that it provides security measures protecting the databases as defined in Articles 36– 39 of the Act, and meets the technical and organizational requirements specified in the provisions of Article 39a of the Act.</p>
    <p>In case ClickMeeting does not fulfill its duties pursuant to the above provisions, the total liability of ClickMeeting, irrespective of the legal grounds of such liability, shall be limited to the direct damages sustained by the User. ClickMeeting shall not be liable for any indirect damages, subject to the intentional guilt or gross negligence of ClickMeeting. The total liability of ClickMeeting shall in no event exceed the amount of the remuneration due to ClickMeeting for the settlement period directly preceeding the settlement period in which the User raised his claim.</p>
    <p>The User is entitled to conclude the contract on outsourcing the Participant's personal data processing with ClickMeeting. In order to do so, the User shall contact ClickMeeting via this form <a href="https://clickmeeting.com/contact">https://clickmeeting.com/contact</a>.

    <h2>Erasure of Processed Data</h2>
    <p>ClickMeeting will retain User's and Participant's Data and the information regarding the User's Account for as long as needed to provide you the Service. We will retain and use the above data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

    <p>After the periods mentioned above (60 or 90 days respectively), the data will be permanently erased from the Service and their recovery will not be feasible. Participant's database may be returned to the User at its request made within 7 days of erasure of the data from the Service.</p>
</div>

<div id="GroupASub4" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Passwords</h2>
    <p>The User's Account information, username, password and user profile are password-protected so that they have secure access to entering and editing personal data. It is the User's responsibility to protect the security of their password. Access to the Service is protected by a unique username and password that is known to the User only. ClickMeeting has designed internal security processes that encrypt the User's password to protect it from being divulged or accessed by anyone other than the User. Neither ClickMeeting employees nor any of its contractors can obtain or access to the User's password. Neither ClickMeeting employees or nor any of its contractors will ask the User for their password via mail, email, telephone or in any other unsolicited manner.</p>

<div id="GroupASub7" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent the User's and Participant's personal information to third parties for marketing purposes unless they have granted us permission to do so.</p>
    <p>We may share the User's and Participant's personal information within other services of ClickMeeting for purposes of data processing or storage.

<div id="GroupASub8" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>
    <p>As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information about visitors to our site automatically and store it in log files.<br />
    The site use information includes, but is not limited to, the following: the domain names, operating system in use (e.g. Macintosh, Windows), browser (e.g. Mozilla Firefox, Internet Explorer) and version, the website which referred the User to us, and other similar information. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on our website, pages viewed, time and date of visits, and other similar information. We may use and disclose site use information, for example, to measure the use of our website, improve the content, explain the utility of our website and services we provide, and to extend their functionality.</p>
    <p>Similar to other commercial websites, the technology called "cookies" may be used to provide the User with tailored information. A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can send to the User's browser, which may then be stored on their hard drive, so we can recognize the user when they return. The User may be able to set their browser to notify them when they receive a cookie. Our cookies collect general information that enhances our ability to serve the User and measure the utility of our website.</p>
    <p>A cookie cannot read personal data off a hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites; indeed, the only personal information a cookie can contain is information the User supplies him or herself. Accepting the cookies used on our website may give us access to information about the User's browsing behavior, which we may use to personalize their experience and track user traffic patterns, and to merge this info when the user registers. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of our website information to our Users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information.</p>
    <p>The User may browse most of Service's website without accepting cookies; however, some website functionality may be lost by the User disabling cookies on their computer. Information we collect may be used to enhance the use of our website, and to provide the User with a service that they ordered, arrange the website in the most customer friendly way, communicate special offers and featured items, and/or respond to any questions and suggestions.</p>
    <p>The use of cookies by any partners, affiliates, tracking utility company or service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.</p>
</div>

<div id="GroupASub9" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Web Beacons</h2>
    <p>We employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a User's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our Users' personal information.</p>
</div>

<div id="GroupASub10" class="subgroup">
    <h2>Information Security</h2>
    <p>We believe that keeping personal information secure is one of our most significant responsibilities.</p>
    <p>We restrict access to personal information about the User and the Participants to those employees and others who need to know that information to assist us in our business, or to provide products or services to the User. We safeguard personal information, according to the established security standards and procedures, by maintaining physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to the personal data information.</p>
    <p>All of our Users' and Participants' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (e.g. our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are personally granted access to sensitive information.</p>
    <p>When we request Users to enter sensitive information, such as their name, geographical address, email address, and a credit card number, it is encrypted and protected with the best encryption software in the industry SSL and processed through a reputable payment processor. While on the secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers, e.g. Mozilla Firefox or Microsoft Internet Explorer, becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when the User is just 'surfing'.</p>
    <p>ClickMeeting stores its servers in a highly secure server environment, with surveillance and support to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data security.</p>
    <p>We cannot guarantee the security of the User's data while it is being transmitted over the Internet and through servers that are beyond our control. We strive to protect the User's personal information but ClickMeeting cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information they transmit to our website or Services. Any data transmissions the User makes over the Internet are done so at their own risk. Once we receive the data transmission, we make our best efforts to ensure its security and privacy on our systems.</p>
    <p>Service in-meeting information is encrypted from the beginning till the end and only accessible by the User and Participants. "In-meeting information" includes all screen sharing data and chat information. Information about scheduled meetings and meetings such as time, organizer, subject of meeting, are placed on our web site and are available to the User and logged Participants that received an invitation from the User via email or other means of communication.</p>

        </li>
        <li>The Affiliate shall market and advertise the Program and the Service diligently and in goodwill, and shall develop, operate and maintain their website and referral links, at their sole expense and risk. In particular, the Affiliate shall be solely responsible for all materials that appear on their website. The Company shall have the right to approve or decline the graphics, logos, banners and other materials used by the Affiliate in relation to the referral link to the Company’s website and to make suggestions related to those issues to the Affiliate.  The Affiliate agrees to conform to the suggestions made by the Company, in particular the Affiliate is obliged to make changes to their website and other marketing materials used to promote the Service.</li>
        <li>Promoting the Service and/or the Program via Google Adwords or through other search engine service providers is strictly prohibited. Should the Affiliate wish to use Google Adwords or other search engine services, he/she is required to receive a prior permission from the Company.</li>

    </ol>
</div>

<div id="GroupDSub5" class="subgroup">
    <h3>V. Affiliate Commissions </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The Affiliate will receive a Commission for each complete purchase of the Service made in the Agreement term by the customer referred by the Affiliate. This means that the Affiliate will receive the Commission upon accepted payment if the customer was referred through the Affiliate’s referral link and the customer's software allowed Company to save such a referral cookie. The Affiliate is not entitled to the Commission for the purchases of the Service through their own referral link - this means that the Affiliate will not receive the Commission for the purchase of the Service made by the Affiliate himself/herself, their corporation, employer or the like or any other entity which controls, is controlled by or is under common control with, the Affiliate.  This includes also any purchases made not under Affiliate’s name but with the use of Affiliate’s payment medium (e.g. credit card, check, bank account)</li>
        <li>If a new customer referred by the Affiliate purchases the Service, the Affiliate will receive a residual Commission calculated as a percentage of the amount paid to the Company for the Service by the referred customer. In such case the Commission rate is 30%.</li>
        <li>Where the customer referred by the Affiliate has paid for the Service in other currency than the one used for settlement purposes with the Affiliate, we will convert and credit the associated Commission in the relevant currency using the published Wall Street Journal index at the time of payment.</li>
        <li>A summary of purchases of the Service and statement of referral Commission is available to the Affiliate by logging into their Affiliate account.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to grant discount for the Service to chosen customers. Commissions reflect a percentage, not a particular amount, therefore it is possible that the Commission on the sale of the same Service may be different every month. </li>
        <li>Commissions are calculated on the last day of each month and are paid out only when the accrued Commissions exceed either USD 50, EUR 50, GBP 50 or PLN 150 (depending on the Affiliate’s domicile/residence). If on the last day of the month the balance owing in the account is less than the aforesaid limit, the Commission will be accumulated in the account. Commissions are credited to your Affiliate account once the customer pays for the Service. Commissions are only earned if a customer makes a payment in full. </li>
        <li>Accrued Commissions are paid in the form of USD check, ACH, Eurotransfer or via other payment method if agreed individually with the Company. Affiliate checks are mailed via regular mail to the address provided upon registration, on or around the 20th of every subsequent month. The Commission paid by ACH and Eurotransfer is effected on the same date as in case of checks.</li>
        <li>Based on internal risk analysis, the Company reserves the right to withhold first time payments and any other payments originating from an account where there is suspected fraud activity - for a period of up to 3 months and in cases the Affiliate violates any of the provisions of these Terms – all Commissions accrued and not paid out for as long as the Affiliate is in breach. The Company reserves also the right to disqualify Commissions earned through fraudulent, illegal, or overly aggressive, questionable sales or marketing methods.</li>
        <li>To ensure proper Commission payment, the Affiliate is solely responsible for providing and maintaining accurate contact details including address, as well as payment information associated with the Affiliate’s account. If you are a US taxpayer, you should include without limitation a valid tax identification number and Form W-9. If you are a non-US taxpayer, you should provide the Company without limitation with either a signed certification that you do not have US Activities, or a completed Form W-8 or other form, which may require a valid US tax identification number, as required by the US tax authorities. No Commission payment shall be made unless the Affiliate provides the Company with accurate and complete contact and tax details.</li>
        <li>The Affiliate acknowledges and agrees that all the sums of Commissions payable under the Program are calculated jointly for the purpose of fulfillment of tax obligations. </li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to change the Commission rate and Service prices at any time. Any Commissions accrued after such a change will be at the new rate.  </li>
    </ol>
</div>

<div id="GroupDSub6" class="subgroup">
    <h3>VI. Refunds/Chargebacks/Fraud </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Any customer refunds, reversals or credit card chargebacks owed by the Company to the referred customer will result in the appropriate Commission amount being deducted from the Affiliate's account balance <strong>("Deducted Commission")</strong>. If the Commission from that sale has already been paid to the Affiliate, the amount will be deducted from future payments of the Commissions. If the Commission owed to the Affiliate in the next month is not sufficient to satisfy the Deducted Commission, GetResponse may invoicethe Affiliate will be invoiced for the payment of the remaining debt immediately and the Affiliate is obligated to pay it within the payment date provided in the invoice.</li>
        <li>The Company reserves the right to terminate the Agreement with immediate effect in the event of not receiving the remaining debt within the payment date provided in the invoice referred to in s. 1 above. </li>
        <li>Any fraudulent activity that can be traced directly to the Affiliate's actions will cause immediate termination and forfeiture of any Commission earned.</li>
        <li>If an account of customer referred by Affiliate is terminated due to practices or actions that GetResponse considers to be abusive, prohibited or that violate GetResponse Terms of Service in other ways, GetResponse reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to withhold or forfeit one or all Commissions earned (regardless of whether paid or outstanding) for referring the terminated customer. If the number of terminated customer accounts referred by Affiliate is abnormal or GetResponse may reasonably suspect that it is a part of fraudulent activity, GetResponse shall have the right, at its sole discretion, to forfeit not only Commissions earned for referring terminated customers, but all Commissions earned (regardless of whether paid or outstanding) by Affiliate during the term of Agreement. As regards settlement rules section 1 and 2 above shall apply accordingly, i.e. GetResponse is entitled in particular to deduct relevant amounts of forfeited Commissions from future payments due to Affiliate and if the Commission owed in the next month is not sufficient, GetResponse may invoice the Affiliate for payment of remaining debt.</li>
