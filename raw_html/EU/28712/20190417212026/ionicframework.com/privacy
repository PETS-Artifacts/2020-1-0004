<p><span id="_Hlk510514023" class="anchor"></span>When you use your mobile device to interact with us or use the Ionic Services, we may receive information about your mobile device, including a unique identifier for your device. We and our service providers and third parties we collaborate with, including ad networks, may use cross-device/cross-context tracking. For example, you might use multiple browsers on a single device, or use various devices (such as desktops, smartphones, and tablets), which can result in your having multiple accounts or profiles across these various contexts and devices. Cross-device/cross-context technology may be used to connect these various accounts or profiles and the corresponding data from the different contexts and devices.</p>
<p><span id="Employment" class="anchor"></span><strong>8. EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES</strong></p>

<p><span id="ThirdPartySites" class="anchor"></span><strong>9. THIRD PARTY SITES</strong></p>
<p>The Ionic Services may provide links to other websites or resources over which Ionic does not have control (“External Web Sites”). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by Ionic of those External Web Sites. You acknowledge that Ionic is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that Ionic is not responsible for the content of such External Web Sites. Your use of External Web Sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the applicable External Web Site. We encourage you to be aware when leaving our Services and to read the privacy statements of External Web Sites that collect your personal information.</p>
<p><span id="Security" class="anchor"></span><strong>10. SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of personal information, we employ procedural and technological measures that are reasonably designed to help safeguard the information we collect. Only authorized Ionic personnel have access to the personal information, including server logs and cookie utilization data, that we collect. These individuals are required to follow strict security policies and procedures. Ionic may use encryption, secure socket layer, firewall, password protection and other physical and logical security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to such. Ionic may also place internal restrictions on who in the company may access data to help prevent unauthorized access to such information.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Therefore, despite our efforts, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We do not warrant or represent that personal information about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.</p>
<p>If you use the Services, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your access information and password. You are responsible for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your password. We cannot secure any personal information that you release on your own, that you request us to release or that is released through another third party to whom you’ve given access.</p>
<p>Where required under applicable law or by contract, we will notify the appropriate parties or individuals of any loss, misuse or alteration of personal information so that such parties or individuals can take the appropriate actions for the due protection of their rights. If such personal information is information of an Ionic customer, we will notify such customer and coordinate with them regarding any required notices to particular individuals.</p>
<p><span id="Children" class="anchor"></span><strong>11. CHILDREN</strong></p>
<p>We recognize the importance of protecting the privacy and safety of children. The Ionic Services are not intended for children under 13 years of age - and for European residents, for children under 16 years of age - see our <a href="#Euro">European Privacy Policy</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Anyone under 13 should not use the Ionic Services. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as set forth below.</p>
<p><span id="International" class="anchor"></span><strong>12. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</strong></p>
<p>The Ionic Services may be provided using resources and servers located in various countries around the world, including the United States and other countries. Therefore, personal information about individuals or customers may be transferred, processed and stored outside the country where the Ionic Services are used, including to countries outside the European Union (“EU”), European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, where the level of data protection may not be deemed adequate by the European Commission. With respect to Europe, we comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework as described in our EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Privacy Policy, which supplements this policy, and may also use standard data protection clauses adopted by supervisory authorities and approved by the European Commission to safeguard transfers.</p>
<p><span id="California" class="anchor"></span><strong>13. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>Under California’s “Shine the Light” law, California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use may be entitled to request and obtain from us, once per calendar year, information about customer information we have shared, if any, with other businesses for such other businesses’ own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of resident information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such resident information for the immediately prior calendar year.
