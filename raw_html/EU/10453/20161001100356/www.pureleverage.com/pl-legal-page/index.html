<h2 class="page-header text-center"><strong> AFFILIATE AGREEMENT</strong></h2>
<p> Each participant in the affiliate program offered by Global Virtual Opportunities (the &#8220;Global Virtual Opportunities&#8221;) at (the &#8220;website&#8221;) expressly agrees to this affiliate agreement. </p>
<p> <b>NOTICE: Please read this agreement carefully. Unless you expressly agree and consent to this agreement, you may NOT participate in the affiliate program. By participating in the affiliate program, you are agreeing to comply with and be legally bound by the terms and conditions of this contract. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this agreement, please do not register for the affiliate program.</b> </p>
<p> This agreement incorporates Global Virtual Opportunities Terms and Conditions of Use (located on this website) herein as if it were set forth in full. </p>
<p> Throughout this agreement, &#8220;affiliate program&#8221; refers to the affiliate program operated by Global Virtual Opportunities in part for the website. </p>
<h3>AFFILIATES</h3>
<p>Each affiliate is an independent contractor of Global Virtual Opportunities and not an employee. Nothing herein is intended to create an employer/employee relationship.<br />
<h3>COMMISSIONS &amp; REFERRAL FEES</h3>
<p>Whenever someone orders through your affiliate link, your affiliate ID is credited with a referral fee. When another affiliate registers as an affiliate using your affiliate link, your account is credited as the Sponsoring affiliate. You do not earn a referral fee for any other affiliate&#8217;s registration. The commission/referral fee amount varies from product, service or opportunity. The rate at which your referral fee is generated can be found on the website and is subject to change at any time. If the website is silent as to the commission rate, then the base rate is located in your secure members log-in dashboard.</p>
<p>Before any affiliate may be a sent a commission check, the affiliate must submit to Global Virtual Opportunities identification information. Such identification information shall include, at a minimum, a copy of a government issued, picture, identification card (for example, a driver&#8217;s license). These documents shall be faxed or submitted in a manner acceptable under law to Global Virtual Opportunities as per the instructions sent in your members secure log-in dashboard. You will not receive any payment of commission/referral fees until such time as you submit the required documentation to Global Virtual Opportunities.</p>
<p>Commissions on products and services are paid at the rates as indicated in your secure members log-in dashboard. Global Virtual Opportunities strives to pay similar rates on further products, services, and opportunities, but reserves the right to pay a different scale if necessary.  </p>
<h3>INCOME TAX LIABILITIES</h3>
<p>Each affiliate acts as an independent contractor and as such is responsible for any or all United States, state, or foreign income taxes and any other tax liabilities that affect or concern the sales of the products or services, in your state or location. If you are NOT a resident of the United States, Global Virtual Opportunities will withhold the appropriate U.S. income tax applicable to foreign nationals, prior to your receipt of any commissions. Global Virtual Opportunities does so pursuant to the United States Internal Revenue Service laws (also known as the United States Tax Code) and other applicable laws. It is the affiliate&#8217;s sole responsibility, and not the responsibility of Global Virtual Opportunities, to take any steps necessary to recover these sums under the Tax Code and other applicable laws.</p>
<h3>EMBARGOED NATIONS &amp; SPECIALLY DESIGNATED NATIONALS</h3>
<p>The United States controls the export of products and information. Each affiliate agrees to comply with such restrictions and to not export or re-export the materials (including software) to countries or persons prohibited under the export control laws. By becoming an affiliate, you are agreeing that you are not in a country where such export is prohibited or are not a person or entity to which export is prohibited. You are responsible for compliance with the laws of your local jurisdiction with regard to the import, export, or re-export of the materials (including software). </p>
<p>Each affiliate is responsible for compliance with all applicable U.S. laws and regulations, including but not limited to, those laws pertaining to export control. By registering as an affiliate, you warrant that you are not a citizen or resident of a country designated as having Embargoed Nation Status and further, you also warrant that you are not on the list of Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department. The products and/or services are exported from the United States in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations. Diversion to other countries is contrary to U.S. law and is prohibited.</p>
<p>In compliance with the United States Patriot Act, only those who have provided appropriate identification information and do not reside within an embargoed nation and who are not listed on the Specially Designated Nationals list may receive commission checks paid by Global Virtual Opportunities.</p>
<h3>COMMISSION SCHEDULE </h3>
<p>Commissions are paid once per month by Global Virtual Opportunities on the day of the month for sales made from the first through the last day of the previous month, and are paid by Global Virtual Opportunities.</p>
<p>There &#8220;may&#8221; be minimum commission payout amount.. This is the minimum amount that you must earn before you will be paid commissions. In any commission period, your commission must exceed this amount before you will receive any sums for that period. Commissions below this minimum amount will be held until such time as the commission equals or exceeds this amount.</p>
<p>Commissions are not paid for any sales for which payment has not been received, or for any transaction that has been rejected for any reason.</p>
<p>We are not responsible for paying interest to affiliates for accrued but not yet delivered commission payments.</p>
<p>If a transaction incurs a charge-back, or if an online transaction is not completed in every way, no commission payment is due to the affiliate. If a commission has already been paid, then it will be deducted from an active affiliate&#8217;s future commissions.</p>
<p>All commissions are paid in US Dollars by means deemed appropriate. Affiliates requesting bank drafts will have a processing fee of $10.00 deducted from the check, should this service be offered. This fee may change at any time.</p>
<p>Each affiliate is responsible for selecting the payment processor, through which to receive their commissions/referral fees, from the payment processors supported by Global Virtual Opportunities. If you elect a payment processor through which to receive your commissions and you later terminate the account or the account becomes unavailable for any reason, Global Virtual Opportunities is not responsible for your not receiving the money. Each affiliate is responsible for always maintaining the payment processor through which they receive their commissions/referral fees OR selecting an alternate method of payment supported by Global Virtual Opportunities. This election is entirely made by the affiliate and Global Virtual Opportunities assumes no responsibility for non-receipt of payments made according to the payment processor elected by the affiliate, or the affiliate&#8217;s lack of ability to then conform to the payment processors or processes supported by Global Virtual Opportunities. Global Virtual Opportunities assumes no responsibility for an affiliate not electing a payment processor. If an affiliate fails to elect a payment processor, any sums due will be paid via check and any fees applicable to payments by check or bank draft will be deducted.</p>
<h3>MIXING OF PRODUCTS </h3>
<p>As an affiliate of Global Virtual Opportunities, your website on which you advertise any products or services of Global Virtual Opportunities may only include products that are not capable of being viewed by persons 13 years of age or younger unless Global Virtual Opportunities specifically allows such products. Your website may NOT contain any content or images that are NOT suitable for being viewed by persons 13 years of age or younger if you include any reference whatsoever to Global Virtual Opportunities, the website, the eBook(s), or your affiliate Link. On any website on which you include any reference whatsoever to Global Virtual Opportunities, its products, services, and eBooks, you may NOT include any reference whatsoever to any form of &#8220;Adult&#8221; content. Any violation of these requirements will result in immediate termination of your affiliate status and you shall forfeit any commissions/referral fees that may be due. In the event that any violation of these requirements results in the suspension or termination of any payment processor for Global Virtual Opportunities, you shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of $10,000 as well as actual and any consequential or actual damages that or Global Virtual Opportunities may incur. </p>
<h3>PAYMENT PROCESSOR FEES </h3>
<p>All commissions are calculated based on the net transaction. In other words, all payment processor fees are first deducted from the sums collected from the customer. Then, all payment processor fees are deducted. The remaining amount is a commissionable sale. The commission rate listed on the website is then applied to determine the amount due the affiliate. Any sums paid for payment processor fees are not commissionable. Global Virtual Opportunities may also charge a per transaction fee for every transaction processed. In the event that a per-transaction fee is applied, the amount of the fee can be seen on the website. Any such fee is not commissionable and is also deducted from the sums paid by the customer, prior to the calculation of any commission. </p>
<h3>SPAM &amp; UNSOLICITED COMMERCIAL EMAIL (UCE) </h3>
<p>Global Virtual Opportunities does not tolerate the sending of unsolicited bulk emails (UCE or SPAM) which promote, or make reference to Global Virtual Opportunities, or any of their associated companies or websites, Partners, or employees, the websites, products or services.

<p>Cross recruiting will not be tolerated and grounds for immediate termination. If you are found to have promoted other opportunities to any affiliate, other than your &#8220;personal&#8221; referrals, Global Virtual Opportunities shall have the right to terminate your position. This shall include sub-affiliates in your organization.</p>
<p>Global Virtual Opportunities reserves the right to reject any affiliate application if, in Global Virtual Opportunities opinion, that person or entity violates established laws or commonly held standards of decency. For example, we will reject applications from any person or company that promotes any form of violence, illegal activities, or from applicants who Global Virtual Opportunities prefers not to be associated with.</p>

<h3>COMPENSATION DISCLOSURE POLICY</h3>
<p>YOU SHOULD ALWAYS CONDUCT YOUR OWN INVESTIGATION (PERFORM DUE DILIGENCE) BEFORE BUYING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM ANYONE VIA THE INTERNET. THIS INCLUDES PRODUCTS AND SERVICES SOLD ON THIS WEBSITE AND ALL OTHER WEBSITES.</p>
<h3>MATERIAL CONNECTION</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise expressly stated, you should assume that all references to products and services on www.GoGVO.com, are made because material connections exist between the website&#8217;s owner (&#8220;Owner&#8221;) and the providers of the mentioned products and services (&#8220;Provider&#8221;).</p>
<h3>GOOD FAITH RECOMMENDATIONS</h3>
<p>The Owner recommends products and services on www.GoGVO.com based in part on a good faith belief that the purchase of such products or services will help purchasers in general. The Owner has this good faith belief because (a) the Owner has tried the product or service mentioned prior to recommending it or (b) the Owner has researched the reputation of the Provider and has made the decision to recommend the Provider&#8217;s products or services based on the Provider&#8217;s history of providing these or other products or services. The representations made by the Owner about products and services reflect the Owner&#8217;s honest opinion based upon the facts known to the Owner at the time a product or service is mentioned on www.GoGVO.com.</p>
<h3>POTENTIAL BIAS AND DUE DILIGENCE</h3>
<p>The Owner&#8217;s opinion about a product or service may be partially formed (consciously or subconsciously) in part based on the fact that the Owner has been compensated or will be compensated because of the Owner&#8217;s business relationships with the Providers.</p>
<p>In some instances, the Owner and a Provider will have a business or personal relationship that does not involve the Owner receiving compensation related to products and services mentioned on www.GoGVO.com. However, the nature of the relationship is sufficient to establish a material connection between the Owner and the Provider.</p>
<p>Because there is a material connection between the Owner and Providers of products or services mentioned on www.GoGVO.com, you should always assume that the Owner may be biased because of the Owner&#8217;s relationship with a Provider and/or because the Owner has received or will receive something of value from a Provider.</p>
<p>Perform your own due diligence before purchasing a product or service mentioned on www.GoGVO.com (or any other website).</p>
<h3>COMPENSATION</h3>
<p>The type of compensation received by the Owner may vary. In some instances, the Owner may receive complimentary products, services, or money from a Provider prior to mentioning the Provider&#8217;s products or services on www.GoGVO.com.</p>
<p>In other instances, the Owner may receive a monetary commission or non-monetary compensation when you take action based on the content of www.GoGVO.com.
