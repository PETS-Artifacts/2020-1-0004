    <h3>Users accessing Mind Tools through a corporate account</h3>

    <p>If you are accessing our Website, or have opened an account with us, through an arrangement established with your
        employer, we will only contact you about your account and the resources your employer has made available to you.
        We will not contact you about other products and services we offer.</p>

    <h3>Publicly sourced company email addresses</h3>

    <p>We may obtain individuals’ company email addresses from public sources (either directly or through a third party
        provider) in order to send relevant communications about our products and services in accordance with the UK
        Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. We will ensure at all times that our processing of such
        publicly sourced company email addresses is lawful and we will implement any changes which may be required when
        the proposed EU ePrivacy Regulation comes into force.</p>

    <h3>Advertising and Analytics</h3>

    <p>When you use our website or App, we or a third party partner may serve you advertisements that may be of interest to
        you. These advertisements are based on information relating to your access to, and use of, our website and other
        websites. If you would like more general information about these practices,
        <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/">click here</a></p>

    <p>We use the Facebook pixel in order to understand the types of people that visit our website and show you relevant
        advertisements for things you may have looked at on our website. You can find out more about the Facebook Pixel
        <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217">here</a>, including how to adjust your preferences with
            Facebook.</p>

    <p>We also use third party analytics providers like Google Adsense to serve ads to you based on your prior visits to
        our website and other sites on the internet. You can always opt out of interest based advertising by visiting
        Google’s <a href="https://adssettings.google.com">Ad Settings</a>.</p>

    <h3>How we build our audience profile through Social Media platforms</h3>

    <p>We work with social and business media platforms including Facebook and LinkedIn to bring you targeted
        advertising about our products and services and improve your experience on our website. To do this, we provide
        them with a list of email addresses and they confirm if they operate accounts with those email addresses. This
        enables us to provide relevant advertising on each platform to those accounts and to build an audience profile
        to help our adverts reach other people on each platform who may be interested in our products and services.</p>

    <p>If the platform does not have an account with a matching email address, the contract terms under which they act
        as our processor for this purpose does not permit them to make any further use of the email address we
        provided.</p>

    <p>We believe we have a legitimate interest in customising our social media communications in this way and that
        there is minimal impact on your privacy. Nevertheless, you can always tell us not to share your information with
        Facebook, LinkedIn or any other platform by notifying us at <a href="mailto:privacy@mindtools.com">privacy@mindtools.com</a>.
        Alternatively, if you have an account on any platform, you can set your preferences via your platform account.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>

    <p> The data you enter is needed to provide a good service to you on the Mind Tools website. We will treat your
        information with complete respect and will not disclose it to any third party, other than to parties such as
        credit card processors involved directly in providing a high quality service to you and as outlined in the

    <h2>Where We Store Your Personal Data</h2>

    <p> We will keep your personal data secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its
        unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. </p>

    <p>The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European
        Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who process payment details
        and who provide support services. Transfers will only be made to countries which are the subject of an adequacy
        decision of the EU Commission or recipients who have entered into binding contracts with us to comply with the
        terms of this Privacy Policy and Data Protection Law. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this
        transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated
        securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>

    <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted
        using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
        certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a
        password with anyone.</p>

        best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any
        transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and
        security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

            it for the purpose for which it was collected, if you withdraw your consent, if you have objected to our
            processing and we have no other justification for processing the data, if it was processed unlawfully or if
            we are under a legal obligation to erase the data. If one of these grounds exist and we have no other
            legitimate grounds for retaining or processing your data, we will erase it without delay.
        </li>

        <li>Right to object - you can object to our processing of your data. We will stop processing the data unless we

        </li>

        <li>Restriction right - this will apply if you contest the accuracy of the personal data we hold, until we can
            verify its accuracy; if the processing is unlawful; if you wish us to preserve it for a legal claim or if
            you object to processing based on our or a third party's legitimate interests, until we decide which
