</div><h2 id="6-competitions-and-prizes">6. COMPETITIONS AND PRIZES</h2>
<div class="panel">
<p>When you upload Content for entry into one of our photo challenges, the Photocrowd.com team may, after the closing date for the relevant challenge, act as resident judges and experts to determine a shortlist of finalists. This shortlist of finalists will then be provided to any guest or external judge/expert (as advertised in the relevant challenge) to select the winner and runners up of the relevant competition. In all cases the published rules of the challenge will apply and the judge’s decision is final and binding.  After expert judging (or crowd voting, as the case may be) to select winners has finished, the prize winners will be notified  by email to the winning user’s email account. To be confirmed as a winner and to be awarded the prize, the winning user may be required to confirm full legal ownership of the winning Content and, where applicable, that the winning Content was first created during the relevant challenge period. Should a prize notification or prize addressed to a particular user be returned as undeliverable, we will not resend the notice (whether by the same or another method), research the user's address or make any further attempts at delivery or contact. Where a winner's shipping address is located in a country or area designated by Photocrowd.com, in its sole discretion, as undeliverable, we reserve the right to provide a cash payment sent via PayPal or voucher of equal value to the advertised prize instead of the specific advertised prize. Prizes are not transferable.
Winners will be announced after the confirmation required above is received and the respective winner(s) are confirmed. Photocrowd.com reserves the right to announce prize winners collectively, one at a time, or in any order or clusters as it deems appropriate, in its discretion, except that the winner of expert-judged or crowd-rated prizes will be announced within thirty (30) days of the date on which the confirmation required above is received from the winner. The dispatch of prizes to winners will be the sole responsibility of  the prize sponsor. Prizes are subject to change at any time without notice in the sole discretion of Photocrowd.com or the challenge sponsor. 
By entering into any Photocrowd.com photo challenge, each user releases and holds harmless Photocrowd.com, and any participating prize providers (as well as any of their respective parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agencies), against any and all claims, demands and liabilities arising out of or relating to the challenge, the user's participation in the challenge and/or any challenge-related activity, including, without limitation, from the winner's use or misuse of a prize or any portion thereof. Prizewinners assume all liability for any injury or damage caused, or claimed to be caused, by participation in any Photocrowd.com competition and/or use/redemption of any prize.  We will not be liable for the actions or omissions of third party challenge sponsors or organisers, even if the challenge  is promoted on our website. </p>

We will bill the subscription or any other fee, and any applicable taxes such as value added tax, to your Payment Method. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each subscription period in order to avoid billing of the next period's subscription fees to your Payment Method. Where you change your plan during a subscription period, we may bill you any difference between the subscription fee for your old and new plans for the remainder of that period. The amount billed for the subscribed plan is a recurring amount which will only be varied in the event that you change your plan or we adjust the prices. Where the applicable subscription fee is varied, you authorise us to charge your Payment Method for such varied amounts. We reserve the right to adjust pricing for our Service in our sole discretion. Any price changes will take effect no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. Subject to an initial 14-day cooling off period within which you will receive a full refund in the event of cancellation (except when rating has already commenced in respect of a photo challenge that you have entered), all payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods.</p>
