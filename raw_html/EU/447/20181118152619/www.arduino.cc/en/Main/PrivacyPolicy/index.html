Without your data we cannot perform the activities necessary to allow you to make the donation.</p>
            <p>In addition, we may store your data in order to fulfill the obligations required by law (in particular by tax, anti-money laundering, banking and public security law). The legal basis of this processing is the need to comply with the law. In this second case scenario, the retention period of such data is equal to the retention period required by law (in particular by tax, anti-money laundering, banking and public security law).</p>
            <p><strong>To send essential information concerning your account your use of Arduino products and services.</strong> We use your email to send you important information regarding the status of your account (for example if some of the services you are registered to are about to expire or if your account is about to be closed according to the terms and conditions of the service you accepted), the security of Arduino products and services or changes to this Privacy Policy. The legal basis of this processing is the legitimate interest of Arduino to inform you about your user account and services you have used, and to protect its information systems against security threats. The retention period of data in connection with this processing is equal to the period necessary to carry out the abovementioned communications.</p>
            <p><strong>To let you interact with customer care operators.</strong> We may use your e-mail address or telephone number, as well as the name and/or postal address, to assist you in case you need help using Arduino products and services. Also to provide you customer assistance, we may communicate your data to Arduino’s affiliated companies operating in the European Union, in Switzerland or in the United States and which have entered into with Arduino standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission.

The legal basis for this processing is your explicit consent. The retention period of your data is 12 months from the collection of your data.</p>
            <p><strong>To obtain information on the use of the website.</strong> When you browse our website, even when you do so without being registered or having logged in, the software procedures and the computer system controlling the functioning of the web applications acquire, during their normal operation, some data whose transmission is implicit in the use of Internet communication protocols.</p>
            <p>This information is not collected to be associated with identified data subjects, but due to their very nature they could, through processings and associations with data held by the Data Controller or by third parties, allow users to be identified.</p>
            <p>In case of unregistered users, geographical location data and data related to how the website is used will only be used in an anonymous form that does not in any way allow, even in combination with the Unique Device Identifier (UDID), the MAC address, the IMEI or IMSI codes or other customer codes, to trace, directly or indirectly to your identity, unless you allow us to use your data at the moment of registration with explicit consent. In such case, we shall connect your browsing data used in an anonymous form in the previous 30 days to your identity.</p>
            <p>This category of data includes IP addresses or domain names of the devices used by users connecting to the application, the addresses in URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the requested resources, the time of the request, the method used to submit the request to the server, the size of the file obtained in response, the numerical code given by the server indicating the status of the response (successful, error, etc.), the visited sections of the website, the type of device used, the country from which you connect and other parameters related to the operating system and the user's computer environment. Arduino uses this information solely to allow navigation on its websites and to process the operations normally related to the use of the website.
