<p>Facebook provides certain features and tools (e.g., pixels, SDKs and APIs) that you we have added to the Web Sites to allow us to send data about actions that people take on the Web Sites or mobile app (“Event Data”) to Facebook to track conversions (“Conversion Tracking”), to create custom audiences of people who have visited the Web Sites (“Custom Audiences from the Web Sites”), or to create custom audiences of people who have visited our mobile app (“Custom Audience from the Mobile App”). By accessing the Web Sites you agree to the following:</p>

<p>A. Facebook will use the Event Data received to provide us with insights about the effectiveness of our ads and the use of our website/app or to create our custom audience (as applicable, depending on the specific features we choose to use), and in accordance with Facebook’s Data Policy (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>). Event Data will also enable us to better target ads and to optimize our systems. In connection with such targeting and optimization, Facebook will: (i) use Event Data collected from the Web Sites or mobile app for ads optimization only after such Event Data has been aggregated with other data collected from other advertisers or otherwise collected on Facebook and (ii) not allow other advertisers or third parties to target advertising solely on the basis of Event Data collected from our website or mobile app.</p>

<p>B. Event Data will not be disclosed to other advertisers or to third parties, unless Facebook has our permission or is required to do so by law. Facebook will maintain the confidentiality and security of Event Data, including by maintaining technical and physical safeguards that are designed to (a) protect the security and integrity of data while it is within Facebook’s systems and (b) guard against the accidental or unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure of data within Facebook’s systems.</p>

<p> C. You agree that you have received sufficiently prominent notice and hereby consent to the following:</p>

<p>(1) With respect to the Web Sites’ use of Conversion Tracking or Custom you understand that: (a) third parties may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to collect or receive information from the Web Sites and elsewhere on the internet and use that information to provide measurement services and target ads; (b) you can opt-out of the collection and use of information for ad targeting; and (c) you can access a mechanism for exercising such choice at the following link: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.</p>

<p>D. We agree not to transfer or disclose any personally identifiable information to Facebook or combine any information obtained in connection with these terms with personally identifiable information. We further agree that we will not share with Facebook information that we know or reasonably should know is from or about children under the age of 13 or that includes health, financial, or other categories of sensitive information.</p>

<p>E.

<p>F. Facebook may modify, suspend or terminate access to, or discontinue at any time the availability of Conversion Tracking, Custom Audiences from our Website, or Custom Audiences from our mobile app. We may discontinue our use of the features at any time. We may delete our custom audience from the Facebook system at any time through our account tools.</p>

<p>G. If we are using any of these features on behalf of a third party, we also represent and warrant that we have the authority as agent to such party to use such features on their behalf and bind such party to these terms.</p>

<p>These Terms govern our use of Conversion Tracking and Custom Audiences from the Web Sites. These features are part of “Facebook” under Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms">https://www.facebook.com/legal/terms</a>, the “SRR”), and our use of these features is deemed part of our use of, and actions on, “Facebook.” These Terms do not replace any terms applicable to our purchase of advertising inventory from Facebook, and such terms will continue to apply to our ad campaigns for which we are using Conversion Tracking or Custom Audiences. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and such terms or the SRR, these Terms will govern solely with respect to our use of Conversion Tracking and Custom Audiences, and solely to the extent of the conflict. Facebook reserves the right to monitor or audit our compliance with these terms and to update these terms from time to time, and our continued use of these features constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>
