<p>This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for tufts.edu and other Tufts University websites (together, a "Site" or "Sites") that have pointed you to this page. Please read these terms with the Terms &amp; Conditions of Use. Sites may have additional privacy policy or policies. If you leave a Site and visit a website operated by a third party, Tufts University cannot be held responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting such third-party websites. Accordingly, please exercise caution and review the privacy statement applicable to the website in question. To the extent permissible under applicable law, by using and/or participating in these Sites, you signify that you have read these terms and agree to be bound by and comply with them.

<p>There are a number of circumstances in which you may choose to provide us with your personal information. The following lists the most common ways in which we may collect your personal information:</p>
<ul><li>When you sign up to receive e-mail newsletters from us</li>

<li>When you provide user-generated content on any Site that permits it</li>
<li>In conjunction with any other place on the Site where you knowingly volunteer personal information.</li>
</ul><p>When you interact with any Tufts page or account on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, or Pinterest, or when you use your social media account or credentials to log in to a Site, we may also collect the personal information that you make available to us on that page or through that account, including your username, account ID or “handle.”</p>
<p>It is Tufts’ policy to hold all personal information you supply in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy law.</p>
<h4>Information Gathered About You or Your Devices</h4>
<p>We collect information when you access one of the Sites and when you subscribe to our email services.</p>
<p><em><strong>Device Information</strong></em></p>
<p>We may collect information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access the Sites such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Sites.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em></p>
<p>Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). This may include: which pages you see; how long you stay; what you click on our pages; if you visit the website again; and which country and city you are browsing from. We use cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.</p>
<p>Cookies may be set by an organization other than the Sites. These "third-party cookies" may, for example, originate from websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Tumblr, YouTube, Pinterest or other social media services. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly. You may disable cookies through your individual browser options. Visit <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/">http://www.aboutcookies.org/</a> for information on how to do this.</p>
<p><em><strong>Google Analytics</strong></em></p>
<p>One or more of our Sites may also use a third-party service, Google Analytics, to track website statistics. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. We use the information collected to understand how our visitors are using the website and make improvements for a better online experience.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions and collects the Internet protocol (IP) address of website visitors in order to provide us a sense of where our visitors come from, but Google Analytics does not report visitors’ actual IP address information to us.</p>
<p>We do not use Google Analytics to track or collect personal information (name, email address, billing information or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information) and we do not associate personal information with web analytics information.</p>
<p>To see the full Google Analytics privacy policy and learn more about their privacy practices, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en">Google Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245">Google Analytics: Safeguarding Your Data</a>.</p>
<h4>Email Terms</h4>
<p>When you give us your email address, we may use it to respond, or to communicate information about the University or its activities. If you do not wish to receive communications from Tufts, please click on the unsubscribe link in the body of the message.</p>
<p>Depending on the context in which you submitted your contact information, your data may be accessible to Tufts and its schools, departments, institutes, centers, and divisions connected to Tufts. It is used and processed for a full range of communications and programs involving academic and administrative departments. These include the following communications and marketing activities (by mail, email and telephone):</p>
<ul><li>Sending University publications</li>
<li>Promoting our services</li>
<li>Notifying you of upcoming events</li>
<li>Promoting opportunities</li>
</ul><p>Tools may be used to help us improve the effectiveness of our communications with you, including tracking whether the emails we send are opened and which links are clicked within a message. Lastly, we use data to undertake analysis projects to ensure only effective and relevant communications are sent to you.</p>
<p>If you send us email messages, you should be aware that information disclosed in email may not be secure or encrypted and thus may be available to others. We suggest that you exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal or confidential information in email.</p>
<h4>How Do We Use Your Information?</h4>
<p>We use your IP address to administer our Sites by identifying (1) which parts of a Site are most heavily used, (2) where our users come from (i.e., a referring sign or a search engine, etc.), and (3) which portion of our audience comes from within or outside the Tufts network. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable unless we are required to do so under applicable law or court order or authorized to do so under our policies.</p>
<p>The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions.</p>
<p>To the extent provided, we may use your user information in order to process student, financial aid or job applications, student or employee registrations, and other services and benefits that we provide to our students, employees and other persons.</p>
<h4>Sites Use by Minors</h4>
<p>The Sites are not directed to individuals under the age of thirteen (13), and we do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 13.</p>
<h4>Will Tufts share my personal information with others?</h4>
<p>User information may be shared with third-party partners to the extent necessary for such third parties to provide services to us or to users of our Sites, or provide and improve web services or other communications to users. Any third parties who receive user information for this purpose are prohibited from using or sharing user information for any purpose other than providing services to Tufts or to users.</p>
<p>We may also provide your information to third parties in circumstances where we believe that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of us, our users or others.</p>

<p>The Sites are published in the United States and are subject to the laws of the United States. If you are located in a country outside the United States and voluntarily submit personal information to us, your information will be used as provided in this Privacy Statement and will be transferred to, and/or be stored in, the United States.</p>

<h4>Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant.

Tufts University does not endorse the content of any third-party site, nor does Tufts University warrant that a third-party site will be free of computer viruses or other harmful code that can impact your computer or other web-access device. If you link to any third-party site through a Tufts’ Site, Site content, or Site services, please be aware that you are doing so at your own risk.

<h4>Choice of Law</h4>
<p>These Terms shall be governed in all respects by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts without giving effect to its conflicts of law provisions.

The parties further agree that any cause of action arising under these Terms shall exclusively be brought in such courts. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe, or describe the scope or extent of such section. Tufts University’s failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.</p>

The below information is the same for many such situations, and we thought it would be helpful to have it in one place.</p>
<h4>3. What is “EEA Personal Data?”</h4>
<p>Your personal information is EEA Personal Data if:</p>
<ol><li>
<p>It is “personal data” as defined in the GDPR; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GDPR includes protection of the personal data in its scope.</p>
</li>
</ol><p><em><strong>What is “personal data” under the GDPR?</strong></em></p>
<p>The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).</p>
<p><strong><em>What is the scope of the GDPR?</em></strong></p>
<p>The GDPR generally applies to collecting, using or other “processing” (please see below) of personal data (as provided in Article 3):</p>
<ol><li>
<p>When the processing is part of the activities of an organization that acts in an established way in the EEA. It’s not required that the processing take place in the EEA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the organization offers goods or services to persons who are physically in the EEA. A payment for the goods or services is not required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the processing is by an organization that is not established in the EEA and the processing activities are related to the monitoring of the behavior of a person who is physically in the EEA, as far as their behavior takes place within the EEA.</p>
</li>
</ol><p>For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or while you participate in an established Tufts program occurring in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.</p>
<p>“Processing” is a term used by the GDPR to cover any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to destroying. GDPR Article 4 (2).</p>
<h4>4. What is the purpose and lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>It is Tufts’ policy to collect, use and process EEA Personal Data about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under the GDPR. A legal basis under the GDPR may be:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>We need it to perform a contract with you, such as to provide you services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to promote and provide goods and services to you and to protect our legal rights and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to process your data in connection with your or another person’s vital interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need to process your data in connection with the public interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have another legal basis permitted under the GDPR.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.</p>
<p>Unless you are told otherwise, there is no requirement to supply us with any of your EEA Personal Data. It is Tufts’ policy to not use EEA Personal Data to carry out any automated decision-making that affect you without an appropriate legal basis as required by the GDPR.</p>
<p><em><strong>What are the purposes and lawful bases under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites?</strong></em></p>
<p>Tufts will process your EEA Personal Data in connection with the Sites for a variety of service- and business-related purposes, including for analyzing and improving website performance; email and other communications; processing you have requested; third-party services; and security and legal requirements.</p>
<p>The use of your EEA Personal Data in the manner described above and in the <a href="#Privacy Statement">Privacy Statement</a> are necessary for the legitimate interests of the University in operating and improving its Sites, analyzing their use, and ensuring their security. The Sites collect limited EEA Personal Data and we use it in ways that are compatible with your individual rights and freedoms. Where you enter your EEA Personal Data into an online form on any of our Sites for any specified purpose, you will be told about the use we will make of that information (e.g., to send you newsletters or to enable your attendance at an event).</p>
<h4>5. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?</h4>
<p>We will use reasonable measures to ensure that your EEA Personal Data is only transferred to third parties who also maintain at least the standard of protection required under the GDPR.</p>
<h4>6. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?</h4>
<p>Information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at Records Retention Schedules.</p>
<h4>7. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at <a href="#Making a Subject Access Request under the GDPR">How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR</a>.</p>
<ul><li>
<p><em>The right of access</em>. You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The right to correct</em>. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)</em>. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The right to restrict processing</em>. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data. This is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The right to data portability</em>. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>The right to object</em>. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.</p>
</li>
</ul><h4>8. Where can I go if I have questions?</h4>
<p>If you have any questions about how your EEA Personal Data is used, or wish to exercise any of your rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data, please see <a href="#Making a Subject Access Request under the GDPR">How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR</a> or contact Tufts' Data Privacy Team at <a href="mailto:dataprivacy@tufts.edu">dataprivacy@tufts.edu</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not happy with the way your EEA Personal Data is being handled, or with the response received from us, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the GDPR supervisory authority in the EEA country where you habitually reside, where you work, or where you believe an infringement of the GDPR occurred.</p>
<h4>9. Changes to this Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>Tufts University reserves the right to change, modify, or otherwise amend this Privacy Statement at its sole discretion and at any time as it deems circumstances warrant. Any such changes will be posted on this page.</p>

<div class="accordion__content">
<p>This statement provides information about the use of EEA Personal Data provided by prospective students and applicants for admission to the schools’ programs and for financial aid for those programs. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.</p>
<p>This statement should be read together with the <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement">EEA Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<h4>1. What is “EEA Personal Data?”</h4>
<p>For purposes of this statement for prospective students and applicants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with your interest in our academic programs and/or applying for admission to, or financial aid for, those programs.</p>
<p>The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).</p>
<p>The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4 (2).</p>
<h4>2. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>The information provided here applies to the collection, use, sharing, disclosure and other processing of your EEA Personal Data by Tufts University and its schools (<a href="http://www.tufts.edu">www.tufts.edu</a>) as part of the admissions and financial aid process. The schools assessing your application for admission and for financial aid may provide you with additional statements about how they will collect, use, share, disclose and otherwise process your EEA Personal Data as you progress through the admissions and financial aid process.</p>
<h4>3. What EEA Personal Data will be collected, used or otherwise processed?</h4>
<p><em>For prospective students and applicants to undergraduate and graduate degree and certificate programs of the School of Arts and Sciences, the School of Engineering, and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts at Tufts:</em></p>
<p>Tufts will use the details provided, including on your Common Application, the Coalition Application, or the Questbridge application (undergraduate programs) or the graduate program application, supplementary application materials, together with the supporting documents requested and additional details provided by the persons submitting letters of recommendation or recorded following an interview, if one is conducted. Tufts will also use personal details you provide on any inquiry form (web-based, hand-written inquiry cards at recruitment events and information sessions), registration forms and inquiry email.</p>
<p>If applicable, Tufts also processes the information submitted in connection with your financial aid application. For certain degree programs, we will also conduct background screening checks for safeguarding purposes.</p>
<p>Additional information about the collection, use, combining and other processing of your EEA Personal Data is available by contacting the Admissions and Financial Aid offices of each school.</p>
<p><em>For prospective students and applicants to the School of Medicine, Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences, School of Dental Medicine, Gerald J. and Dorothy R. Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine and The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy:</em></p>
<p>Tufts will use the details provided, including on your application, supplementary application materials, together with the supporting documents requested and additional details provided by the persons submitting letters of recommendation or recorded following an interview, if one is conducted. If applicable, some Tufts schools also process the financial information submitted in connection with your financial aid application. For certain degree programs, the school may also conduct background screening checks for safeguarding purposes and to make sure that its students are available for professional rotations and licensure.</p>
<p>Additional information about the collection, use, combining and other processing of your EEA Personal Data is available by contacting the Admissions and Financial Aid offices of each school.</p>
<p><em>All Schools.</em></p>
<p>In addition to the personal information referred to above, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections under the GDPR. This includes information you may provide concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.</p>
<h4>4. What is the purpose and lawful basis of the processing?</h4>
<p>Tufts will use your EEA Personal Data provided on your admission application, the financial aid application, and the other information referred to above for the purposes of answering questions you may have, identifying you, processing your application, verifying the information provided, assessing your candidacy for admission to the programs to which you applied and deciding whether to offer you admission to those programs, assessing your eligibility for financial aid and determining what financial aid will be offered to you, and communicating to you those outcomes.</p>
<p>Additionally, Tufts may use or disclose the information provided for statutory, public interest and other purposes, including:</p>
<ul><li>To prevent or detect fraud.</li>
<li>To comply with applicable laws and regulations and Tufts’ policies, including but not limited to its non-discrimination policy.</li>
<li>To help us to make reasonable accommodations for any disability, as requested by you.</li>
<li>To allow for consideration of any future accommodation requirements.</li>
<li>To offer and deliver university goods, services, and experiences to you.</li>
<li>To help inform and support university and school planning and decision making.</li>
<li>To provide information required by governmental and accrediting organizations.</li>
<li>To conduct research and statistical analysis. No information that could identify you will be published.</li>
</ul><p>The University considers the processing of your personal information for the above purposes necessary to create a contractual relationship with you (e.g. to assess your application for admission), to comply with a legal obligation (e.g. non-discrimination), or to perform tasks carried out in the public interest (e.g. admissions research), and/or for the purposes of Tufts’ legitimate interests, including providing educational and academic programs. We require you to provide your personal information (except for questions marked as optional) during the admissions and financial aid processes in order to assess your candidacy properly. Admissions and financial aid decisions are not automated.</p>
<h4>5. Will Tufts share my EEA Personal Data with others?</h4>
<p>Your application and related materials will be shared with the appropriate faculty and staff at Tufts. Each school has developed its own practices for sharing your personal information based on its consideration of the type and sensitivity of the personal information, the purpose for which the information was provided or otherwise collected, the purpose for sharing the personal information, and the safeguards used to protect the shared information. Accordingly, under certain, considered circumstances, and when relevant, your personal information may also be shared with:</p>
<ul><li><em>Parents, Spouses, and Guardians</em>. In some cases, we may share your information with a parent, spouse, or guardian if necessary to properly complete the admissions process or in the event of an emergency.</li>
<li><em>Service Providers.</em> We may use third parties to support our operations and provide services to our students. In such cases, we may share your information with these third parties.</li>
<li><em>School Counselors and Administrators.</em> We may share your information with your school counselors and administrators.</li>
<li><em>University Affiliated Programs.</em> We may share your information with third parties that are affiliated with the University for the purpose of contacting you about goods, services, or experiences that may be of interest to you.</li>
<li><em>Research and Studies.</em> We may share your information with third parties that study admissions or other topics related to higher education. We may also share your information with third parties that conduct research or develop products or services designed to improve admissions and other higher education functions.</li>
<li><em>Required by Law.</em> We may share your information with third parties to the extent we are required to do so by law, court order, or subpoena. In the case of international applicants, we may share your information with appropriate agencies including the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in order to act as your sponsor for visa purposes.</li>
<li><em>Emergency Circumstances.</em> We may share your information with a person you have designated as an emergency contact or with other third parties if, in our sole judgment, such disclosure is necessary to protect your health, safety, or property or the health, safety, or property of any other person.</li>
<li><em>Compelling Purpose.</em> We may share your information in other cases when there is a compelling purpose regarding benefit to Tufts or members of our community.</li>
<li><em>De-Identified and Aggregate Information.</em> We may use and disclose information about our applicants in de-identified or aggregate form without limitation.</li>
</ul><h4>6. How is my EEA Personal Data used if I am admitted and decide to enroll?</h4>
<p>If you are accepted and decide to enroll, we will use your personal information for the purposes described at How is my EEA Personal Data used? in the <a href="#EEA Privacy Statement for Students">EEA Privacy Statement for Students</a> as amended from time to time. Further information about this will be provided in your offer of admission, and if applicable, your financial aid decision.</p>
<p>If you are accepted and decide to enroll, Tufts will also provide data about you to the National Student Clearinghouse and other external agencies and funding bodies, as required.</p>
<h4>7. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?</h4>
<p>We will store your EEA Personal Data for as long as necessary to complete the application process. Some schools store applicant information permanently. If you are admitted, your personal information will normally be kept for at least one year or longer after the completion of the application process, depending on the policy of the school to which you applied. If you are admitted and decide to enroll, your personal information will be kept as part of your student record for the duration of your studies (and it may be used as part of our assessment of any future application you make for further studies at Tufts). Details about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/">Records Retention Schedule</a> and is available from the school to which you applied. Additional information about how long student information may be retained is available in the <a href="#EEA Privacy Statement for Students">EEA Privacy Statement for Students</a>.</p>

</ul><p>Among the EEA Personal Data included may be your name, home and local addresses, student identification number, Social Security number or other governmental identification numbers, date of birth, courses taken, fee payments, financial aid provided, and information about your examinations, assessments and results.</p>
<p>Your EEA Personal Data is created, stored and transmitted in a variety of paper and electronic formats, including databases at Tufts (such as the main student records database, or the systems used by Tufts libraries). It is Tufts’ policy to limit access to and the use of your EEA Personal Data to Tufts staff, faculty and authorized affiliates who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their professional and contractual duties.</p>
<p>In addition to this, Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs, health or disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions and your fitness to practice in certain regulated professions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.</p>
<p>Tufts’ <a href="http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”</p>

<ul><li>To deliver and administer your education, record the details of your studies (including any placements with external organizations), and determine or confirm your academic achievements (e.g. results, awards).</li>
<li>Where relevant, to monitor, evaluate and support your research activity.</li>

<p>The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to students whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools, for students applying to Tufts-sponsored study abroad programs in the EEA, and for students while they are studying in those programs. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.</p>
<p>This statement should be read together with the <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement">EEA Privacy Statement</a> and the <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants">EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants</a>.</p>
<p>If you are a student in a study abroad program in the EEA sponsored by another university or college, then you should contact the program’s sponsor for information about their processing of any personal information subject to the GDPR.</p>
<p>In addition to the information provided in this statement, students are encouraged to review the information about the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) for their school. FERPA permits the disclosure of certain personal information classified by a school as “directory” information.” See <a href="http://students.tufts.edu/registrar/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act-ferpa">School of Arts and Sciences and School of Engineering FERPA Notice</a>; <a href="http://fletcher.tufts.edu/~/media/Fletcher/Student%20Handbook/Student%20Handbook%202016-2017%20updated%20Jan%202017.pdf">The Fletcher School FERPA Notice</a>; <a href="http://vet.tufts.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017-2018-Student-Handbook.pdf">Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine FERPA Notice</a>; <a href="https://nutrition.tufts.edu/about/policies-and-procedures/family-educational-rights-and-privacy-act">Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy FERPA Notice</a>; <a href="https://dental.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/pdf/Student%20Handbook%202017-18.pdf">School of Dental Medicine FERPA Notice</a>; <a href="https://sackler.tufts.edu/studentLife/currentStudents/FERPA">Sackler School of Graduate Biomedical Sciences FERPA Notice</a>; and <a href="http://medicine.tufts.edu/About-Us/Policies-and-Reports/FERPA">School of Medicine FERPA Notice</a>.

<h4>1. What is “EEA Personal Data”?</h4>
<p>For purposes of this statement for students, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a participant in a Tufts-sponsored study abroad program, or your personal information is used or otherwise processed in the EEA in connection with the program.</p>
<p>The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).<br /><br />
The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4(2).</p>
<h4>3. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?</h4>
<p>In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your EEA Personal Data. For example, there are separate statements for persons who use or engage with Tufts websites (see <a href="#Privacy Statement">Privacy Statement</a>), IT services (see <a href="https://it.tufts.edu/ispol">Use of Institutional Systems Policy</a>), the Counseling and Mental Health service (see <a href="https://students.tufts.edu/health-and-wellness/counseling-and-mental-health/about-us/confidentiality">Confidentiality</a>), the Office of Equal Opportunity (see <a href="http://oeo.tufts.edu/">http://oeo.tufts.edu/</a>), and the libraries (see <a href="http://www.library.tufts.edu/privacyPolicy.html">Tufts University Libraries Privacy Policy</a>).</p>
<h4>4. Who will process my EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>Your EEA Personal Data relating to your Tufts-sponsored study abroad program will be used, shared and otherwise processed by staff, faculty, and other persons directly associated with the program, as well as other Tufts offices whose services support study abroad programs, including the Office of Global Operations, and the International Center.</p>
<p>The program will also share your EEA Personal Data with your school, and other Tufts departments as part of your educational record, and for a variety of other academic, educational, administrative, research and statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Additional information is provided about third parties that may receive EEA Personal Data collected as part of the program, including host families and other universities or colleges that may be affiliated with the Tufts-sponsored program.</p>
<h4>5. What EEA Personal Data will be processed?</h4>
<p>The EEA Personal Data that the study abroad program may keep a record of may include the EEA Personal Data:</p>
<ul><li>you provided in connection with your application to the study abroad program, including financial aid applications, if any (see <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants">EEA Privacy Statement for Prospective Students and Applicants</a>),</li>
<li>included in records about your studies at Tufts,</li>
<li>included in records about your use of the academic and non-academic facilities and services in connection with the program.</li>

It is Tufts’ policy to limit access to and the use of your EEA Personal Data to Tufts staff, faculty and authorized affiliates who have a legitimate interest in it for the purpose of carrying out their professional and contractual duties.</p>
<p>Tufts may process some EEA Personal Data about you that is classified as “special category” EEA Personal Data, which requires additional protections. This includes information concerning your race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religious beliefs or health/disability that we use for planning and monitoring purposes, or in order to provide care, help or suitable adjustments. For certain programs of study, other sensitive information may be processed, such as information about past criminal convictions. Access to, and the sharing of, this sensitive or “special category” EEA Personal Data are controlled very carefully.</p>
<p>Tufts’ <a href="http://oeo.tufts.edu/policies-procedures/non-discrimination-policy/">Non-Discrimination Policy</a> “prohibits discrimination against and harassment of any student, employee, applicant for employment, third party or community member because of race; color; national or ethnic origin; age; religion; disability; sex; sexual orientation; gender; gender identity and expression; including a transgender identity; genetics; veteran status; retaliation; and any other characteristic protected under applicable federal or state law.”</p>

Please read these terms together with the <a href="https://www.tufts.edu/about/privacy">Tufts University Privacy Statement</a>, the <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement">EEA Privacy Statement</a>, and the <a href="https://access.tufts.edu/personnel-records">Statement on Personnel Records</a>.</p>
<h4>What is “EEA Personal Data?”</h4>
<p>For purposes of this statement for job applicants, faculty, staff, consultants and other persons providing services, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a job applicant, faculty, staff, consultant or other person providing services.</p>
<p>The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).</p>
<p>The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR. Article 4(2).</p>
<p>For example, if you provide personal information to Tufts when you are physically present in the EEA or when you are providing services on behalf of Tufts in the EEA, or if your personal information is used or otherwise processed in connection with a university established activity in the EEA, that personal information may be EEA Personal Data.</p>

<p>Communications to you may be sent by mail, telephone or electronic means, depending on the contact details we hold and the preferences expressed by you about the types of communications you wish to receive. Alumni may at any time opt-out of receiving all emails from the alumni association, or just emails from companies and institutions offering services and benefits to alumni, by clicking on the "update your email subscription preferences" link in emails and following the specified instructions, or by calling 1-800-THE-ALUM (1-800-843-2586) or 617-627-3532, by faxing a request to 617-627-3938, or by mailing a request to Tufts University Alumni Association, 80 George St., Ste. 100-3, Medford, MA 02155.</p>
<h4>4. The lawful basis under the GDPR for processing your EEA Personal Data</h4>
<p>The lawful basis for processing your EEA Personal Data under the GDPR include being necessary for the pursuit of our legitimate interests, the carrying out of a task in the public interest, and in some instances, the performance of a contract. We always endeavor to handle your EEA Personal Data securely and minimize its use.</p>
<h4>5. How we protect your EEA Personal Data</h4>
<p>It is Tufts’ policy to have appropriate data sharing agreements in place before sharing your EEA Personal Data.</p>
<p>We do not sell your EEA Personal Data to third parties under any circumstances, or permit third parties to sell the EEA Personal Data we have shared with them. In addition, it is Tufts policy to prohibit any third party (except those selected by the Tufts University Alumni Association and University Advancement) from using alumni or donor data for any commercial or business marketing.</p>
<p>The above types of sharing may involve the transfer of your EEA Personal Data outside the European Economic Area. Such transfers usually are necessary (i) in order to meet our contractual obligations with you or contractual obligations with others that are in your interest, (ii) for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, (iii) to protect your vital interest, or (iv) as otherwise permitted by the GDPR. The transfers are carried out with confidentiality and privacy safeguards in place to protect your EEA Personal Data.</p>
<h4>6. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?</h4>
<p>We will retain your EEA Personal Data indefinitely in support of your lifelong relationship with Tufts or until you request us to do otherwise. Further information about Tufts’ record retention practices can be found at our <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/">Records Retention Schedule</a>.</p>
<h4>7. What rights do I have with respect to my EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>The GDPR provides you with several specific data protection rights with respect to your EEA Personal Data. These are generally described below. Further details, including how to submit a request, are published at <a href="#Making a Subject Access Request under the GDPR">How to make a Subject Access Request under the GDPR</a>.</p>
<ul><li><em>The right of access.</em> You have the right to confirmation of the EEA Personal Data that is processed about you by Tufts and to a copy of the information. This right is subject to limitations, including that providing a copy will not adversely affect the rights of others.</li>
<li><em>The right to correct</em>. The GDPR includes a right for you to have inaccurate EEA Personal Data rectified, or taking into account the purposes of the processing, completed if it is incomplete.</li>
<li><em>The right to erasure (also known as the right to be forgotten)</em>. The GDPR includes a right for individuals to have their EEA Personal Data erased in certain limited circumstances. This right is not absolute.</li>
<li><em>The right to restrict processing</em>. You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your EEA Personal Data.

If processing is restricted, Tufts would not be permitted to use the data without your consent, unless in connection with a legal claim, the protection of another person, or other exceptions. Tufts would be permitted to continue to store the information.</li>
<li><em>The right to data portability</em>. The right to data portability allows you to obtain an electronic copy of your EEA Personal Data to enable you to reuse that data for your own purposes across different services. This right allows you to move, copy or transfer EEA Personal Data easily from one IT environment to another. This right only applies to information you have provided to Tufts and depending on the context, applies to some of your information, but not to all of your information.</li>
<li><em>The right to object</em>. The GDPR gives individuals the right to object to the processing of their personal data in certain circumstances, in the absence of a compelling reason for the continued processing.</li>
</ul><h4>8. Where can I go if I have questions?</h4>

<div class="accordion__content">
<p>The following statement has been prepared to provide notice to research participants whose EEA Personal Data is collected, used or otherwise processed by Tufts University, including its schools. This statement provides notice under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the European Economic Area (EEA). The GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is a regulation adopted for the EEA that governs the use and processing of personal information. Tufts is committed to processing your EEA Personal Data in compliance with the GDPR and has prepared this statement to provide you with information about your rights under the GDPR.</p>
<p>This statement should be read together with the <a href="#European Economic Area (EEA) Privacy Statement">EEA Privacy Statement</a>.</p>
<h4>1. What is “EEA Personal Data”?</h4>
<p>For purposes of this statement for participants, your personal information is EEA Personal Data if it is “personal data” (as defined in the GDPR) and you are in the EEA when you provide the personal information to us in connection with being a research participant. The GDPR defines “personal data” broadly. It includes “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.” The person the personal data is about is called the “data subject.” Examples of personal data include your “name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier [and] factors specific to [your] physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.” GDPR. Article 4(1).</p>
<p>The GDPR often uses the term “processing,” which includes any way of working with personal data, from collecting to using to sharing to disposing of it. GDPR Article 4(2).</p>
<h4>2. How does this webpage relate to other information about data protection?</h4>
<p>The general information published on this page is intended to supplement the specific information that you have already been given (for example on a participant information sheet or a consent form) in connection with your participation in a research study or project run by academic researchers affiliated with Tufts University. The below information applies to all studies and projects that are conducted by Tufts researchers. In the unlikely event that there is any contradiction between this general information and the specific information that you have already been given, the specific information takes precedence.</p>
<p>In addition to the information published here, when you use specific services and facilities offered by Tufts, you may be told about other uses of your EEA Personal Data. For example, there are separate statements for persons who use or engage with Tufts websites (see <a href="#Privacy Statement">Privacy Statement</a>) and IT services (see <a href="https://it.tufts.edu/ispol">Use of Institutional Systems Policy</a>).</p>
<h4>3. What EEA Personal Data will be processed, who will process my EEA Personal Data, and who will my EEA Personal Data be shared with?</h4>
<p>You have already been told about the types of personal information we will use in connection with the specific research study or project you are participating in and (where applicable) its sources, any data sharing or international transfer arrangements, and any automated decision-making that affects you.</p>
<p>You have already been told about the types of personal information we will collect and process in connection with the specific research study or project you are participating in and where and how we might collect those data, any data sharing or international transfer arrangements that may be part of the research project, and any automated decision-making that affects you.</p>
<h4>4. What is the purpose and legal basis of the processing of EEA Personal Data?</h4>
<p>In general terms, we use your EEA Personal Data (including, where appropriate, EEA Personal Data that is sensitive) to carry out academic and/or translational research in the public interest.</p>
<h4>5. How long will my EEA Personal Data be kept?</h4>
<p>You have already been told about the long-term use (and, where applicable, re-use) and retention of your EEA Personal Data in connection with the specific research study or project you are participating in. General information about how long different types of information are retained by Tufts is published at <a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/dca/records-management/records-policies/records-retention-schedule/">Records Retention Schedule</a>.</p>
