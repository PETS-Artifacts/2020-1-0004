The goal of this measurement is to specify the number of visits on our website, the amount of visitors on our website and their surfing habits - based on a unified standard process - in order to receive market-wide comparable values.</p><p>For all digital offers which are members of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW – <a href="http://www.ivw.eu" rel="nofollow">http://www.ivw.eu</a>) or take part at studies of the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V.

These reach and statistics can be seen on the respective websites.</p><h3>Legal basis for the processing</h3> The measurement using the measurement method SZMnG of the INFOnline GmbH is taken place because of legitimate interest based on Art. 6 Para. 1 point f GDPR. Purpose of the processing of personal data is to create statistics and build categories of users. The statistics are used to understand and verify the usage of our service. The user categories are the basis to provide advertising materials or rather advertising measures based on their interest. The marketing of this website requires a measurement which is essential to compare with other market players. Our legitimate interest arises from the commercial exploitability of the resulting knowledge from these statistics and user categories and the market value of our website - especially directly compared to third party websites - which can be determined by these statistics. Furthermore we have a legitimate interest to provide the pseudonymised data of INFOnline, AGOF and IVW for the purpose of market research (AGOF, agma) and statistical purposes (INFOnline, IVW).

Even the brief storage of the IP address is technically necessary due to the operating principle of the internet. The IP addresses are shortened by 1 byte before any processing takes place and is only processed anonymously. There’s no further storage or processing of unabridged IP addresses.</li><li>A random created client-identifier: For recognition purposes the reach processing uses either a cookie with the identifier „ioam.de", a „local storage object“ or it uses a signature based on the automatically submitted data from your browser. This identifier is unique for a browser as long as the cookie or the local storage object doesn’t get deleted. A measurement of data and the subsequent assignment is therefore also possible if you visit a website which also makes use of the measurement method („SZMnG“) of INFOnline GmbH. The validity of the cookies is limited to a maximum of 1 year.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Use of the data</h3><p>The measurement method of INFOnline GmbH, which is used on this website, collects usage data.

This happens solely on basis of anonymized IP addresses only up to the geographic level of federal states / regions. It is not possible to draw conclusions to a specific whereabout of a user based on this collected geographic info.</li><li>The usage data of a technical client (e.g. a browser on a device) will be merged across the boundaries of the websites and stored in a database. These information will be used for a technical estimation of the socioinformation age and gender and will be transferred to service providers of the AGOF for further reach processings. Sample tests are taking place as a part of the AGOF-study to technically determine sociocharacteristics of the following categories: age, gender, nationality, professional activity, marital status, basic information about the household, household income, residence, internet usage, online interests, usage location, usage type.</li></ul><p></p><h3>Storage period of the data</h3><p>The complete IP address will not be stored by INFOnline GmbH.
