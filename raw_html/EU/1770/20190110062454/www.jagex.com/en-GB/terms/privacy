            <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF THIRD-PARTY TAILORED ADVERTISING</strong>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in our games on your mobile device, you may opt- out by:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>adjusting the ad tracking settings on your device</li>
             <li>resetting your Identifier For Advertising (IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioural data tied to the previous Identifier For Advertising (IDFA).</li>
             <li>visiting the following link: <a href="https://www.appsflyer.com/optout">https://www.appsflyer.com/optout</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within our games even if you opt out of tailored advertising, but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.</p>

            <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF GEOLOCATION</strong></p>

            <p>If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's settings for the games or the “settings” page for the games.</p>

            <p><strong>OPTING OUT OF OTHER COMMUNICATIONS</strong></p>

            <p>When you install our games on your mobile device you can choose to receive push notifications, which are messages our games send you on your mobile device even when the game is not on. You can turn off notifications by visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.</p>

            <p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>

            <p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see <a href="http://www.jagex.com/terms/cookies">our Cookie Policy</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>CHANGE OF PURPOSE</strong></p>

            <p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose.</p>

            <p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.</p>

            <p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>

            <p><strong>5. DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>

            <p>We may have to share your personal data with third parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above.</p>

            <ul>
             <li>Specific marketing partners listed <a href="https://www.jagex.com/terms/third-party-partners">here</a>.</li>
             <li>We may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>

            <p><strong>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></p>

            <p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>

            <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

            <ul>
             <li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
             <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
             <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>7. DATA SECURITY</strong></p>

            <p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

            <p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

            <p><strong>8. DATA RETENTION</strong></p>

            <p><strong>HOW LONG WILL YOU USE MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?</strong></p>

            <p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

            <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

            <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years plus current year after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>

            <p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <em>Request erasure</em> below for further information.</p>

            <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>

            <p><strong>9. YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>

            <p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. We set out below a brief description of such rights:</p>

            <ul>
             <li><strong>Request access to your personal data</strong> <strong>(commonly known as a “data subject access request”):</strong> This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
             <li><strong>Request correction of your personal data</strong><strong>:</strong> This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
             <li><strong>Request erasure of your personal data</strong><strong>:</strong> This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
             <li><strong>Object to processing </strong><strong>of your personal data:</strong> Where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms</li>
             <li><strong>Request restriction of processing your personal data</strong><strong>: </strong>This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; or (b) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it</li>
             <li><strong>Request the transfer </strong><strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party:</strong> We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</li>
             <li><strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong><strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data:</strong> However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please <a href="#co_anchor_a599551_1">Contact us</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>NO FEE USUALLY REQUIRED</strong></p>

            <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

            <p><strong>WHAT WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</strong></p>

            <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

            <p><strong>TIME LIMIT TO RESPOND</strong></p>

            <p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests, in which case we will inform you of an extension period of up to 2 months. In this case, we will keep you informed on progress.</p>

            <p><strong>10. GLOSSARY</strong></p>

            <p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p>

            <p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by <a href="#co_anchor_a599551_1">Contacting us</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>

            <p><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>

            <p><strong>Explicit consent</strong> <strong>for external marketing</strong> means your personal data will not be disclosed to any third party unless you have given your explicit consent to such disclosure.</p>

            <p><strong>11. POLICY UPDATES</strong></p>

            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in technology, legislation, our operations, or as we otherwise determine is necessary or appropriate. Any such changes will become effective when we make the revised policy available on our website. We encourage you to review the date above frequently to ensure you are aware of when our policy was last revised, and to help you better understand the nature of your interactions with us.</p> </div></div>   <footer class="c-footer c-footer--color-lime"><div class="c-footer__inner"><a class="c-footer__jagex" href="/">   <svg  viewBox="0 -1 277 80" version="1.1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><polygon fill="#d3d800" points="60.4872 -0.0002 57.6142 5.7558 24.2762 72.1228 13.3222 72.1228 29.3572 40.1918 29.3432 40.1638 29.3522 40.1408 13.3462 8.2678 33.4892 8.2678 29.3882 0.0448 0.0002 0.0448 20.1542 40.1708 0.0002 80.2968 0.0232 80.2968 0.0002 80.3408 29.3882 80.3408 65.5952 8.2178 76.5512 8.2178 60.5132 40.1478 60.5282 40.1798 60.5182 40.2018 76.5302 72.0768 56.3842 72.0768 60.4872 80.2968 89.8752 80.2968 69.7202 40.1708 89.8752 0.0448 89.8542 0.0448 89.8752 -0.0002"></polygon>  <g fill="#ffffff"><path d="M116.1294,47.9546 C117.0134,47.9546 117.7474,47.8226 118.3294,47.5546 C118.9104,47.2876 119.3754,46.9076 119.7244,46.4196 C120.0764,45.9316 120.3194,45.3496 120.4584,44.6736 C120.5984,43.9986 120.6684,43.2546 120.6684,42.4406 L120.6684,28.6846 L125.9404,28.6846 L125.9404,41.9846 C125.9404,43.2656 125.8344,44.5166 125.6254,45.7386 C125.4164,46.9616 124.9914,48.0426 124.3524,48.9866 C123.7114,49.9276 122.8044,50.6906 121.6284,51.2726 C120.4524,51.8536 118.8994,52.1456 116.9674,52.1456 C116.5714,52.1456 116.1414,52.1226 115.6764,52.0746 C115.2094,52.0296 114.7334,51.9586 114.2454,51.8656 C113.7564,51.7716 113.2724,51.6496 112.7964,51.4996 C112.3184,51.3486 111.8694,51.1676 111.4514,50.9576 L111.4514,46.5936 C112.2184,47.0376 113.0294,47.3726 113.8774,47.6056 C114.7274,47.8386 115.4784,47.9546 116.1294,47.9546"></path><path d="M158.0778,48.0956 L149.2458,48.0956 L147.6378,51.7266 L142.4688,51.7266 L153.3988,28.2656 L154.1648,28.2656 L164.9208,51.7266 L159.6468,51.7266 L158.0778,48.0956 Z M150.8148,44.5336 L156.5428,44.5336 L153.7838,38.1446 L153.6448,38.1446 L150.8148,44.5336 Z"></path><path d="M180.4916,40.3791 C180.4916,38.7051 180.7836,37.1271 181.3626,35.6481 C181.9466,34.1711 182.7836,32.8811 183.8796,31.7741 C184.9706,30.6681 186.2996,29.7951 187.8596,29.1561 C189.4166,28.5151 191.1746,28.1961 193.1296,28.1961 C194.0136,28.1961 195.0666,28.2831 196.2886,28.4561 C197.5126,28.6321 198.6456,28.9631 199.6946,29.4521 L199.6946,33.9541 C198.6666,33.4191 197.6216,33.0431 196.5526,32.8211 C195.4826,32.6001 194.4796,32.4891 193.5486,32.4891 C192.4316,32.4891 191.3996,32.6711 190.4566,33.0301 C189.5176,33.3921 188.7016,33.9141 188.0156,34.6021 C187.3276,35.2891 186.7856,36.1201 186.3906,37.0981 C185.9946,38.0751 185.7996,39.1931 185.7996,40.4501 C185.7996,41.4961 185.9426,42.4801 186.2346,43.3991 C186.5226,44.3201 186.9666,45.1171 187.5596,45.7921 C188.1566,46.4671 188.9006,47.0011 189.7966,47.3981 C190.6886,47.7921 191.7546,47.9911 192.9906,47.9911 C193.4766,47.9911 194.0136,47.9451 194.5976,47.8511 C195.1776,47.7581 195.6766,47.6301 196.0946,47.4661 L196.0946,39.8551 L200.7046,39.8551 L200.7046,50.7821 C199.5626,51.2511 198.2856,51.5871 196.8646,51.7971 C195.4446,52.0041 194.0136,52.1111 192.5706,52.1111 C190.5916,52.1111 188.8446,51.8191 187.3346,51.2381 C185.8206,50.6561 184.5606,49.8421 183.5456,48.7931 C182.5336,47.7471 181.7686,46.5071 181.2616,45.0751 C180.7446,43.6431 180.4916,42.0781 180.4916,40.3791"></path><polygon points="236.7309 51.7262 220.4629 51.7262 220.4629 28.6842 236.0669 28.6842 236.0669 32.6992 225.6659 32.6992 225.6659 37.7952 234.9839 37.7952 234.9839 41.6722 225.6659 41.6722 225.6659 47.7122 236.7309 47.7122"></polygon><path d="M265.3167,40.6595 L259.4537,51.7265 L253.8647,51.7265 L260.7097,39.8225 L254.3187,28.7185 L259.9057,28.7185 L265.3167,39.0535 L270.6917,28.7185 L276.3127,28.7185 L269.8547,39.8225 C270.9707,41.8225 272.1177,43.8075 273.2927,45.7735 C274.4687,47.7415 275.6147,49.7255 276.7327,51.7265 L271.1117,51.7265 L265.3167,40.6595 Z"></path></g>  </svg> </a><div class="c-footer__content"><p>Copyright &copy;
