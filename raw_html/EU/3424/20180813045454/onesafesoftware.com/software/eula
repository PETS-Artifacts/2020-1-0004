<h2>SOFTWARE UPDATES</h2>
<p>If the Licensed Software is an Update to a previous version, Licensee must possess a valid License to the previous version. Any Update provided to Licensee is made on a License-exchange basis such that Licensee agrees, as a condition for receiving an Update, that Licensee will terminate all of Licensee&#8217;s rights to use any previous version of the Licensed Software.

<p>Avanquest is not obligated by this EULA to provide Licensee with any technical support services relating to the Licensed Software; however, Licensee may order additional support services for an additional charge as Avanquest may offer from time to time during the term of this EULA.</p>
<h2>GOVERNING LAW</h2>
<p>You are a consumer. Nothing in this contract should prevent you from the benefit of rights granted to you by applicable consumer regulation. </p>
<p>This EULA is subject to, and will be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of France, to the extent permitted by applicable consumer law. This EULA will not be governed by the conflict of law rules of any jurisdiction, or the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded. </p>
<h2>DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
<p>IF YOU ARE RESIDING IN, LOCATED IN, CITIZEN OF A EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATE, OR ANYWHERE OTHER THAN THE UNITED-STATES, WHEN PURCHASING THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, THE FOLLOWING DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM APPLIES TO YOU:</p>
<p>Any dispute arising out of, or in connection with this EULA shall be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Paris, France, to the extent permitted by the consumer law of your usual place of residence.</p>
<p>IF YOU ARE RESIDENT, LOCATED IN, CITIZEN OF THE UNITED-STATES, WHEN PURCHASING THE LICENSED SOFTWARE THE FOLLOWING DISPUTE RESOLUTION MECHANISM APPLY TO YOU:</p>
<p>This provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any Disputes that may arise between you and Avanquest.  Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision.  You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your Disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.</p>
<p>Please read this Provision carefully.  It provides that all Disputes between you and Avanquest (as defined below, for this Provision) shall be resolved by binding arbitration.  Arbitration replaces the right to go to court.  In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in court, before a judge or jury, and/or participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions).  Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury.  There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorneys’ fees).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this Provision, “Avanquest” means Avanquest and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.  The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Avanquest regarding any aspect of your relationship with Avanquest, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below).  “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced.</p>
<p>WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.</p>
<p><u>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.</u>  For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Avanquest an opportunity to resolve the Dispute.  You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Avanquest, Legal Department, 89-91 boulevard National, 92250 La Garenne Colombe, France.  That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Dispute, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek.  If Avanquest does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.</p>
<p><u>Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out.</u>  Notwithstanding the above, you or Avanquest may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”).  You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Avanquest, Legal Department, 89-91 boulevard National, 92250 La Garenne Colombe, France.  Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Avanquest through arbitration.  Your decision to opt-out of this Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Avanquest.  <strong>Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.</strong></p>
<p><u>Arbitration Procedures.</u> If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (“Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution”) either you or Avanquest may initiate arbitration proceedings.  JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator.  The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration.  All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision.</p>
<p>The JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols For Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply.  The JAMS rules are available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling 1-800-352-5267.  This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules.  Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration.</p>
<p>Because this EULA and the Licensed Software concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes.  However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.  </p>
<p><u>Arbitration Award.</u> The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding.  The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party.  Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.</p>
<p><u>Location of Arbitration.</u> You or Avanquest may initiate arbitration in either Los Angeles, California or the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution.  In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes the address you provide in your written notification of Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution, Avanquest may transfer the arbitration to Los Angeles, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><u>Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs.</u>  Avanquest will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration.  You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses.  Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law.  In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Avanquest as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
<p><u><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong></u>  Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Avanquest specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. <strong> If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of this Provision, as specified above in section <u>“Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out”</u>, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you.</strong>  Neither you, nor any other user of the Licensed Software can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above. </p>
<p><u>Jury Waiver.</u>  You understand and agree that by entering into this agreement you and Avanquest are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court.  In the absence of this Provision, you and Avanquest might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).  Except as otherwise provided below, those rights are waived.  Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
<p><u>Severability.</u>  If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect.  If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.</p>
<p><u>Review by Arbitrator.</u>  Any dispute regarding this Provision, including the enforceability of this Provision or the arbitrability of any Dispute as provided in this Provision, shall be for the arbitrator to determine.</p>
<p><u>Continuation.</u>  This Provision “DISPUTE RESOLUTION” shall survive the termination of your use of the Licensed Software and any related Avanquest websites or services.</p>
<h2>LIMITED WARRANTY ON MEDIA</h2>
<p>Avanquest warrants that the media on which the Licensed Software is distributed will be free from material defects for a period of 30 days from the date the Licensed Software is delivered to Licensee. If Licensee discovers a defect in the media during this 30-day period, Licensee may return the defective media to Avanquest, and Licensee&#8217;s sole remedy is to have either the defective media replaced, or at Avanquest&#8217;s sole option, a refund of the money that Licensee paid for the Licensed Software.</p>
<h2>NO WARRANTY ON LICENSED SOFTWARE</h2>
<p>THE LICENSED SOFTWARE (EXLUDING THE MEDIA ON WHICH IT IS DISTRIBUTED) AND ALL AVANQUEST RELATED WEBSITES AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO LICENSEE &#8216;AS IS&#8217; AND “AS AVAILABLE,” AND AVANQUEST AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTY AS TO THEIR USE OR PERFORMANCE. AVANQUEST AND ITS SUPPLIERS AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WHETHER BY STATUTE, COMMON LAW, CUSTOM, USAGE, OR OTHERWISE) AS TO ANY MATTER INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION: QUALITY, AVAILABILITY, PERFORMANCE OR FUNCTIONALITY OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ANY RELATED AVANQUEST WEBSITES OR SERVICES; QUALITY OR ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED FROM OR AVAILABLE THROUGH USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR RELATED AVANQUEST WEBSITES OR SERVICES; ANY REPRESENATION OR WARRANTY THAT THE USE OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ANY RELATED AVANQUEST WEBSITES OR SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ALWAYS AVAILABLE (WHETHER DUE TO INTERNET FAILURE OR OTHERWISE), FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS OR OPERATE ON OR WITH ANY PARTICULAR HARDWARE, PLATFORM OR SOFTWARE; NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS, MERCHANTABILITY, INTEGRATION, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, EXCEPT FOR, AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT, THAT A WARRANTY MAY NOT BE EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN LICENSEE&#8217;S JURISDICTION.</p>
<h2>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
<p>IN NO EVENT WILL AVANQUEST, OR AVANQUEST&#8217;S SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS, BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE FOR ANY DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR COSTS WHATSOEVER, OR FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, PUNATIVE, INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS OR LOST SAVINGS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE BASED ON THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED SOFTWARE OR ANY AVANQUEST RELATED WEBSITES OR SERVICES), EVEN IF A REPRESENTATIVE OF AVANQUEST OR ONE OF AVANQUEST’S SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSS, DAMAGES, CLAIMS, OR COSTS, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN LICENSEE&#8217;S JURISDICTION. IN ANY CASE, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF AVANQUEST, AND AVANQUEST&#8217;S SUPPLIERS, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS EULA, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE, OR 5 EUROS.</p>
<h2>ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR BETA SOFTWARE</h2>
<p>If the Licensed Software that Licensee receives with this EULA is pre-commercial release or &#8216;BETA&#8217; software (&#8216;Pre-release Software&#8217;), then, to the extent that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this EULA, this section supersedes such conflicting term(s) and condition(s) as to the Pre-release Software, but only to the extent necessary to resolve the conflict.</p>
<p>Licensee acknowledges that the Pre-release Software does not represent the final product from Avanquest, and may contain bugs and other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Consequently, Avanquest disclaims any warranty or liability obligations to Licensee of any kind whatsoever.</p>
<p>IN APPLICABLE JURISDICTIONS WHERE LIABILITY CANNOT BE SO EXCLUDED FOR PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE, BUT MAY BE LIMITED, AVANQUEST&#8217;S LIABILITY, AND THAT OF ITS SUPPLIERS, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE TOTAL OF FIFTY EUROS (50 EUR).</p>
<p>Licensee acknowledges that Avanquest has not promised or guaranteed to Licensee that the Pre-release Software will be announced or made available to anyone in the future, and that Avanquest has no express or implied obligation to Licensee to announce or introduce the Pre-release Software. Avanquest may decide not to introduce a product similar to, or compatible with, the Pre-release Software. Accordingly, Licensee acknowledges that any research or development that Licensee performs regarding the Pre-release Software, or any product associated with the Pre-release Software, is done entirely at Licensee&#8217;s own risk.</p>
<p>During the term of this EULA, if requested by Avanquest, Licensee will provide feedback to Avanquest regarding testing and use of the Pre-release Software, including problem or bug reports.</p>
<p>If Licensee has been provided the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, then Licensee&#8217;s use of the Pre-release Software is also governed by that agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this EULA to the contrary, if Licensee is located outside the United States, Licensee will return or destroy all unreleased versions of the Pre-release Software within 30 days of the completion of Licensee&#8217;s testing of the Pre-release Software if that date is earlier than the date scheduled for Avanquest&#8217;s first commercial shipment of the publicly released (commercial) software.</p>
<h2>SURVIVAL OF DISCLAIMERS</h2>
<p>The exclusions of warranties and liability limitations shall survive the termination of this EULA, howsoever caused; but this survival shall not imply or create any continued right to use the Licensed Software after termination of this EULA.</p>
<h2>EXPORT RULES</h2>
<p>Licensee shall not ship, transfer, or export Licensed Software into any country or use Licensed Software in any manner prohibited by the applicable export control laws, notably where applicable, the United States Export Administration Act, restrictions, or regulations (collectively the &#8216;Export Laws&#8217;.) All rights to use the Licensed Software are granted on condition that Licensee complies with the Export Laws, and all such rights are forfeited if Licensee fails to comply with the Export Laws.</p>
<h2>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP</h2>
<p>The Licensed Software and any authorized copies that Licensee makes are the intellectual property of, and are owned by, Avanquest, and by third parties whose intellectual property has been licensed by Avanquest. The structure, organization, and code of the Licensed Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information of Avanquest and such third parties. The Licensed Software is protected by law, including without limitation, the copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international treaty provisions. Except as expressly provided in this EULA, Licensee is not granted any intellectual property rights in the Licensed Software.</p>
<h2>RESERVATION OF RIGHTS</h2>
<p>Avanquest reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee by this EULA. The rights granted to Licensee are limited to Avanquest&#8217;s intellectual property rights, and to the intellectual property rights of third parties licensed by Avanquest. All rights are reserved under the copyright laws of France and/or of other countries, to Avanquest Software SA, 89-91 Boulevard National, 92250 La Garennes-Colombes, France.</p>
<h2>COMPLETE AGREEMENT and BINDING EFFECT</h2>
<p>This EULA constitutes the entire agreement between the Licensee and Avanquest relating to the Licensed Software, and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, discussions, undertakings, communications, agreements, arrangements, advertisements, and understandings regulating the Licensed Software. This EULA is binding on and made for the benefit of the parties and their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<h2>MODIFICATION</h2>
<p>This EULA may only be modified, supplemented or amended by a writing signed by an authorized officer of Avanquest.</p>
<h2>SEVERABILITY</h2>
<p>Except as provided in the “Dispute Resolution and Arbitration” Provision, if any provision of this EULA is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions of this EULA will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<h2>WAIVER</h2>
<p>No failure or delay by Avanquest in exercising its rights or remedies shall operate as a waiver unless made by Avanquest’s specific written notice. No single or partial exercise of any right or remedy of Avanquest shall operate as a waiver or preclude any other, or further, exercise of that, or any other right, or remedy.</p>
<h2>PROOF OF COMPLIANCE</h2>
<p>Within 30 calendar days after request from Avanquest, or Avanquest&#8217;s authorized representative, Licensee will provide full documentation, and certify under penalty of perjury, that Licensee&#8217;s use of any and all Licensed Software is in conformity with this EULA.</p>
<h2>TERMINATION</h2>
<p>If Licensee breaches this EULA, and fails to cure any breach within 30 calendar days after request from Avanquest, or Avanquest&#8217;s authorized representative, Avanquest may terminate this EULA, whereupon all rights granted to Licensee shall immediately cease. Furthermore, upon termination, Licensee shall return to Avanquest all copies of the Licensed Software, or verify in writing that all copies of the Licensed Software have been destroyed.</p>
