		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Payment information</h3>
			<p>All payment for any products or services offered through our site, including for any adverts or Early Bird, access are made via a secure server provided by our third party payment processors, currently WorldPay, ImpulsePay (for mobile payments)  and Paypal.

		<li>
			<h3>Third party content, websites and contributors</h3>
			<ol>
			 	<li>Our website may contain content and links to other websites and microsites that are operated by third parties. In addition, advertisements contained on our website may operate as links to that advertiser’s website, and such advertisers and third parties may also use and place cookies on your computer.</li>
			 	<li>We do not control, and accept no liability or responsibility for, these third party websites, advertisements and cookies. This privacy policy does not apply to such third party websites, microsites, advertisements and cookies. Any information such third parties collect by virtue of you clicking on a third party link on our website will be collected and used in accordance with the privacy policy of that third party. Please consult the terms and conditions and privacy policy of those third party websites and microsites to find out how they collect and use your personal data and to establish whether and for what purpose they use cookies.</li>
			 </ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Security and data retention</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We employ appropriate technological and operational security measures to protect against any unauthorised access to or unlawful processing of any personal information about you that we hold. We will retain your information for a period as defined in our data retention policy or as long as the law requires or permits.</li>
				<li>Data transmission over the internet is inherently insecure. Although we employ appropriate technological and organisational security measures to protect your data we cannot guarantee the security of any data sent over the internet.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>International data transfers</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>We collect data from wherever users are situated. The information we collect will be transferred to the UK from any other country in which you may be located, and will as such be subject to General Data Protection Regulation rather than the laws of the country in which you are resident.</li>
				<li>We do not transfer personal data collected via our website outside the European Economic Area (unless you have consented; it is necessary to provide the services you have requested; or it is otherwise required or permitted by law).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h3>Your rights</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>You are entitled to know what personal data we hold about you and you may ask us to make any necessary changes to ensure it is accurate and kept up to date. If you wish to do this, please contact us using the contact information provided in section 1 above. There will be no charge for this service; if, however, you log multiple requests, a nominal charge may be applied to cover the administration of those requests. We may also require you to provide us with appropriate identification.</li>
				<li>
					Under the GDPR, you have the right to ‘block’ or request the deletion or removal of personal data to prevent further processing. This right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. Specific circumstances in which you can request the deletion or removal of personal data include:
					<ol>
						<li>Where the personal data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed</li>
						<li>Where you withdraw consent</li>
						<li>When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing</li>
						<li>Where the personal data was unlawfully processed (i.e. otherwise in breach of the GDPR)</li>
						<li>Where the personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation</li>
					</ol>
					In case a deletion is not possible due to legal, statutory or contractual retention periods, or if it requires disproportionate efforts or prejudices your legitimate interests, the data will be blocked instead of deleted.
				</li>
				<li>You may also request from us a copy of any of your personal data that has been processed through automated means. This will be provided in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format (where technically feasible), which you may then transmit to another controller. You have the right to request that we send this data to another controller on your behalf, but only if it is technically feasible to do so.</li>
				<li>You have the right to withdraw your consent for us to collect, process and store your data at any time. If you wish to withdraw your consent, please confirm this via email to <a class="email" href="mailto:DPO@spareroom.co.uk">DPO@<span class="hidden">null</span>spareroom.co.uk</a></li>
				<li>If you have a complaint about any aspect of data protection or if you feel your privacy has been breached by us, we would like to hear from you. To help us investigate and resolve your concerns as quickly as possible, please contact us via email to <a class="email" href="mailto:DPO@spareroom.co.uk">DPO@<span class="hidden">null</span>spareroom.co.uk</a></li>
