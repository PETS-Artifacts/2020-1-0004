<p class="bodytext">The purpose of this “Privacy Policy” is to inform all individuals from whom Personal Data is collected by 3DS (&quot;You&quot; or &quot;Your&quot;) how 3DS collects and uses such Personal Data and how You can control its use. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Please, note that this Privacy Policy does not cover the AppsforKids products and services which are subject to a separate privacy policy that can be found on the AppsforKids website.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>1. </b><b>SCOPE OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">This Privacy Policy sets forth the principles and guidelines governing the protection of Your Personal Data including the Personal Data collected on or through the Sites. </p>
<p class="bodytext">3DS collects Personal Data either online (including via email) or offline and this Privacy Policy is applicable regardless of the means of collection or processing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Personal data (&quot;Personal Data&quot;) means any information relating to an identified or identifiable person. An identifiable person is a person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the person. </p>
<p class="bodytext">Non-Personal Data means any information that does not result in the identification of a person. </p>
<p class="bodytext">For visitors and users of the Sites: each Site is subject to Terms of Use that can be found on each Site and are incorporated into this Privacy Policy. Your use of the Sites and any Personal Data You provide on the Sites are subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the applicable Terms of Use.</p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>2. </b><b>DATA COLLECTED </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext"><b>a. </b><b>Visitors </b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Visitors are individuals who visit the Sites without registering themselves. Their Personal Data likely includes:</p><ul><li>IP and/or MAC address</li><li>Cookies (as described in section 10); and</li><li>any other Personal Data as may be relevant for the purposes listed below. </li></ul><p class="bodytext"><b>b. </b><b>Users</b></p>
<p class="bodytext">Personal Data collected (including from those who visit Sites and enter information) for the purposes listed below likely includes: </p><ul><li>title; </li><li>first and last name; </li><li>postal address; </li><li>email address; </li><li>telephone number(s); </li><li>login and password; </li><li>university, degree and courses taken;</li><li>type of organization (company, school, university, etc.), organization name, organization size, department and job title;</li><li>industry and industry sub-industry sectors;</li><li>people to whom purchases are shipped;</li><li>financial data (credit card number and expiry date, name and address of the cardholder);</li><li>IP and/or MAC address; </li><li>Cookies (as described in section 10); and </li><li>any other Personal Data as may be relevant for the purposes listed below.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">In all cases, however, the Personal Data gathered is limited to data necessary for the purposes described in Article 4 below.</p>
<p class="bodytext">For visitors and users of the Sites: in order to use certain functions and features of the Site, 3DS requires that You provide certain Personal Data when visiting or using the Site. You are free to decide whether or not to provide all or part of Your Personal Data. However, if You choose not to provide all or part of this Personal Data, the purposes as described in Article 4 hereafter might not be achieved or not properly achieved, some areas and functions of the Sites may not function properly and/or You may be refused access to certain pages on the Site. In particular, You will not be authorized to purchase software licenses or other products or services via the Site. </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>3. </b><b>PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING CHILDREN</b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">With the exception of the AppsforKids products and services which are subject to a separate privacy policy, 3DS products and services are not designed to be marketed to children who are considered as minor under the applicable data protection law and 3DS does not knowingly collect or store Personal Data from children under such age. &nbsp;For children whose usual place of residence is in the European Union, Lichtenstein, Norway or Iceland, the default age at which a person is no longer considered a child is 16 subject to local law to adjust that limit between 13 and 16.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Certain 3DS products and services may be appropriate for use by children, however, in which case children below the age of consent under local data protection laws must seek consent from their parents or guardians prior to creating a 3DS account or registering a product. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and guardians and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents or guardians to do so).</p>
<p class="bodytext">If parents or guardians become aware that their child has provided 3DS with Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask 3DS to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account by sending an email to the 3DS Data Protection Officer: <a href="javascript:linkTo_UnCryptMailto('ocknvq,5FU0Eqornkcpeg/RtkxceaB5fu0eqo');" >3DS.Compliance-Privacy(at)3ds.com</a>. </p>
<p class="bodytext">If 3DS becomes aware that it has collected Personal Data from a child below the age of consent under local data protection laws without consent from a parent or guardian, 3DS will take steps to seek the parent’s or guardian’s consent for that processing or to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account. </p>
<p class="bodytext">&nbsp;</p>
<h3><b>4. </b><b>PURPOSES AND LEGAL GROUNDS FOR PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA </b></h3>
<p class="bodytext">Whether You are a visitor or a user, 3DS collects Your Personal Data for the following legal grounds and for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="bodytext">- Processing activities based on Your consent:</p><ul><li>To improve Your user experience; </li><li>To recognize that You have given a&nbsp; Personal Data so You don't need to do it for every web page requested; </li></ul><p class="bodytext"> <br />- Processing activities based on 3DS’s legitimate interest:<br /> </p><ul><li>To enable 3DS to manage surveys.</li></ul><p class="bodytext">In addition, when You are a user, 3DS collects Your Personal Data on the following legal grounds and for the following purposes:</p>

<p class="bodytext">3DS may provide some strictly necessary personal data such as&nbsp;a hashed user ID to third party operated social networks or other web offerings (such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, or Google) where this information is matched against the social networks own databases in order to display to You more relevant information.</p>
