                last URL you visited prior to clicking through to the Website) and browser and platform type (e.g., a

                using the Website.
            </li>
        </ul>

        We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across

                <strong>Web Beacons.</strong> Pages of our the Website and our e-mails may contain small electronic
                files known as web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, single-pixel gifs and web bugs) that
                are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the
                online movements of web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies which are stored on the user’s
                computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on the web pages (or in email) and are about the
                size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with
                cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages or opened an e-mail, to understand usage patterns
                and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website
                content and verifying system and server integrity). We also may receive an anonymous identification

                usage and user metrics when you use our Website. These tools and technologies collect and analyze
                certain types of information, including cookies, IP addresses, device and software identifiers,
                referring and exit URLs, onsite behavior and usage information, feature use metrics and statistics,
                usage and purchase history, media access control address (MAC Address), mobile unique device ID, and

                and other online products or services may combine the information collected with other information they
                have independently collected from other websites or other online or mobile products and services
                relating to your activities across their network of websites as well as online or mobile products and
                services. Many of these companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies. In

                your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of
                activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for
                Germany. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in
                the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of
                evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and
                providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google
                will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies

                You can refuse the use of Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be

        <strong class="heading">How We Protect Your Personal Information</strong>
        <br/><br/>
        We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard
        your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. For example, only authorized employees are
        permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for permitted business functions. In addition,
        we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and
        we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.
        The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have
        chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password
        confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out
        information in public areas of the Website like message boards. The information you share in public areas may be
        viewed by any user of the Website.
        We want you to feel confident using our Website. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore,
        although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
        personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care
        with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information
        through insecure email. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures
        contained on the Website.

        <br/><br/>
        <strong class="heading">User Contributions</strong>

        disclosed by other users of those features, by us, and other third parties without restriction, except to the
        extent limited access features are available, if any. In addition, such postings may appear on other websites or
        when searches are executed on the subject of your posting. If you post your email address, you may receive
        unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information
        you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal
        information. Once you have posted information, you may not be able to edit or delete such information. To
        request removal of your personal information from our blog, sharing service or community forum, for example,
        contact us at the information provided in this privacy policy. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your
        personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
