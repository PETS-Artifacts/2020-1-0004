            <p>Pinkbike allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the Pinkbike Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the Pinkbike Site. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>

However, please note that if an advertiser asks Pinkbike to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men aged 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men aged 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the Pinkbike Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.
