            <br>
            <br>
            Restream values the privacy of the users, publishers and others who visit and use the Restream Service
            (collectively or individually, "You" or "Users") and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and

            By agreeing to this Privacy Policy in your Restream account setup, or by using the Restream Service, you
            expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this notice.
            <br>
            <br>
            This Privacy Policy applies to Restream collection and use of your personal information (i.e., information
            that identifies a specific person, such as full name, address, phone number, or email address). It also
            describes generally Restream’s practices for handling non-personal information (for example, interests,
            demographics and services usage).

            <br>
            "Automatically Collected" Information : When you access the Restream Service or open one of our HTML emails,
            we may automatically record certain information from your system by using cookies and other types of
