<p class="margin-20">All account information for our Clients is held in strict confidence.</p>
<p class="margin-20">We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell or share your information with anyone.

<h3 class="margin-30">Legal Disclaimer</h3>
<p class="margin-20">We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, bankruptcy proceedings or similar legal process, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.</p>

<h3 class="margin-30">Security</h3>
<p class="margin-20">The security of your personal information and our Clients' information is important to us.

<p class="margin-20">We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can <a class="blue" href="contact-us.htm">contact us</a>.</p>
