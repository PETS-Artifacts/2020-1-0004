<p>Last updated: 28.06.2018</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BVBA MAXFLOW, a limited liability company under Belgian law with registered office at 3000 Leuven, Lei 33 box 0402, Belgium, registered under company registration number 0550.758.377 (RLE Leuven), with trade name “Crazy Games” (hereinafter: “<strong>Crazy Games</strong>”, “<strong>us</strong>”, “<strong>we</strong>”, or “<strong>our</strong>”) operates
<a href="https://www.crazygames.com">https://www.crazygames.com</a>
(the “<strong>Site</strong>”). This privacy policy applies to all of Crazy Games services and products. You should be aware that Crazy Games cannot be held responsible for the privacy policy of other sites and sources.</p>

<h2 id="iiwhydowecollectthesedatabasedonwhichlegalground">II. WHY DO WE COLLECT THESE DATA? BASED ON WHICH LEGAL GROUND?</h2>
<p>Your personal data will be used to enable us to optimise the services we render and the content we provide on the Site. In certain cases when we are under a legal requirement to process personal data, like age limits, we will process said personal data. </p>
<p>We may also use your personal data for direct marketing purposes, such as updates on new or existing games and newsletters. </p>
<p>We may opt to use your personal data for statistical purposes and to improve our services and product. These processing activities are thus based on a justified legitimate interest of Crazy Games.</p>

Unless there is a justified reason to retain the personal data, for example within the framework of customer relation management, your personal data will be deleted one month after you failed to visit our site during a consecutive period of [2] years.</p>
<h2 id="ivyourrights">IV. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
<p>You can get access to your personal data and rectify or erase them, free of charge. You also have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive newsletters or information about our products or services, you can at any moment and without any need for justification, object to the processing of your personal data for these purposes (“unsubscribe”). You can do this by sending us an e-mail or by contacting as at the address mentioned below. You can also do this by clicking on the unsubscribe link in our advertising e-mails.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have the right to data portability for the personal data you have provided to Crazy Games if any and to the extent that Crazy Games has retained your personal data. If you want more information on your rights, you can always contact us or take a look at the website of the Belgian Data Protection Authority:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.privacycommission.be/en">https://www.privacycommission.be/en</a>.</p>
<p>To exercise these rights, we ask you to send a clear request, to the address mentioned below, that states clearly what it is you want to know, rectify or erase. This request needs to be signed and dated and contain a copy of the front side of your identity card or driver’s license.</p>
<p>You should specifically motivate your request if you want to rectify or erase personal data or restrict the processing thereof. Once these conditions are fulfilled, Crazy Games will execute your request as soon as possible and send you a message on this matter.</p>
<h2 id="vcookies">V. COOKIES</h2>
<h3 id="whatarecookies">What are cookies?</h3>
<p>Cookies are small files that are saved on your computer when you visit web pages. They contain information linked to a web browser and the specific website. They are saved in a specific folder on your hard drive. If you return to a specific website, this page can recognize the visitor by means of the cookie and further elaborate the history. A web beacon is an (often transparent) graphic image, usually no larger than 1 pixel, that is placed on a website and that is used to monitor the behavior of the user visiting the website. </p>
<p>Cookies are used to increase visitor-friendliness: by identifying visitors with a cookie, they do not always have to enter the same data such as login information or screen settings every time you visit the website.</p>
<h3 id="whichkindofcookiesexist">Which kind of cookies exist?</h3>
<p>Often a distinction is made between two large groups of cookies:</p>
<p><strong>First party cookies</strong>: these cookies are created by a website to have the web page function better. They regulate the technical part of a site, such as language choice or remembering the products in the shopping basket in an online store. The visited website creates and places first party cookies.</p>
<p><strong>Third party cookies</strong>: these cookies are created and placed on your computer by another (third) party than the website you visit. They remember the behavior of a surfer. Examples are social media such as Facebook or Twitter, but Google Analytics as well. This is the system used most to measure website visits.</p>
<p>Cookies required for the correct functioning of the Site do not require permission. All other cookies do.</p>
<h3 id="whichcookiesdoweuse">Which cookies do we use?</h3>
<p>We will only use first party cookies to help improve your user experience on the Site. We would do this by recording specific information about the user such as the language chosen, the pages visited and the duration of the visits.</p>
<h4 id="youracceptanceofthisprivacypolicybyusingthesiteentailsthatthirdpartiesmaydropcookiesandorusewebbeaconsforadvertisingandtrackingpurposes">Your acceptance of this Privacy Policy by using the Site, entails that third parties may drop cookies and/or use web beacons for advertising and tracking purposes.**</h4>
<p>Third parties might use information gathered by cookies and/or web beacons for the purpose of online behavioral advertising and/or multisite advertising. The types of information that is gathered by third party cookies and/or web beacons as well as the purpose(s) for which this information is used, are set out in the privacy policy of said third parties which Crazy Games encourages you to review. Crazy Games declines all and any liability for any third party cookies or web beacons deployed by third parties for whatever purpose. </p>
<p>The Site may therefore use third party cookies such as cookies from:</p>

<p>In addition, the Site also uses third party cookies such as cookies from Google Analytics.</p>
<p>Google Analytics is a free service by Google to collect statistics of websites and to represent them in detail. The website administrator thus has a clear view on visitor flows, traffic flows and page displays.
