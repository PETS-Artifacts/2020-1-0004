    Dailymotion respects your privacy and has developed this privacy policy
    (the “<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>”) to demonstrate our commitment to
    protecting your privacy and to explain how we collect, use, and share
    information from or about you in connection with your use of the
    Dailymotion Service (the “<strong>Data</strong>”).
</p><p>
    If you reside in a country that is part of the European Economic Area, any
reference to "<strong>Dailymotion</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "    <strong>us</strong>", or “<strong>our</strong>” in this Privacy Policy will
always refer to “Dailymotion SA” whose details are provided    <a href="/legal/infos">here</a>.
</p><p>
    If you reside in a country that is not part of the European Economic Area,
any reference to "<strong>Dailymotion</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "    <strong>us</strong>", or “<strong>our</strong>” in this Privacy Policy will
always refer to “Dailymotion Inc.” whose details are provided    <a href="/legal/infos">here</a>.
</p><p>
    The term "<strong>Dailymotion Service</strong>" refers to the Dailymotion
    website (the "<strong>Dailymotion Site</strong>"), the Dailymotion video
player when it is embedded onto any website (the "<strong>Video Player</strong>"), the Dailymotion apps and web-apps (the “    <strong>Dailymotion Applications</strong>”) as accessible via any current
    or future device capable of distributing the Dailymotion Site and/or the
    Video Player, together with any Dailymotion products, content, channels,
    software, data feeds, services and functionality.
</p><p>
    We encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using the
    Dailymotion Service or transacting business with us.
</p><p>
By viewing any videos available on the Dailymotion Service (“    <strong>Content</strong>”) or otherwise using the Dailymotion Service,
    whether you are a Viewer, Visitor, User, or Partner (as defined in the
    Dailymotion
    <a href="/legal/terms?localization=en">
        Terms of Use
    </a>
    ), you consent to the collection, processing, and use of information from
    or about you as explained in this Privacy Policy. You can always choose not
    to provide certain information to us as further explained herein, but this
    may limit your ability to take full advantage of the many features we
    offer.
    <strong>
        If you do not consent to the collection and use of information from or
        about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, then you must not
        access or use the Dailymotion Service.
    </strong></p><br><p><strong>1. DATA WE COLLECT</strong></p><p><u>1.1. In General.</u>
    We may collect personal information that can identify you directly, such
    as your name and email address, and other information that does not
    identify you directly. When you provide personal information through our
    website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United
    States, France, and other countries around the world. This Section explains
    what personal information we collect and how we collect such information.
</p><p><u>1.2. When we Collect Data.</u></p><p><u>1.2.a. Data Collected from the Dailymotion Site and Applications.</u>
    We collect information when you use the Dailymotion Service directly on the
    Dailymotion Site or through the Dailymotion Applications. <u></u></p><p><u>
        1.2.b. Data Collected from Third Party Websites and Applications that
        use the Dailymotion Service.</u>
    We collect information when you use our Video Player while visiting or
    using third-party websites and apps into which our Video Player is
    embedded. This includes information about the websites and apps that you
    visit, your use of our Video Player on those websites and apps, as well as
    information the developer or publisher of such app or website provides to
    us.<u></u></p><p><u>1.3. Types of Data we Collect.</u></p><p><u>1.3.a. Data You Provide To Us.</u>
    We collect personal information you provide to us when you interact with
    the Dailymotion Service, including when you sign up for an account, upload
    Content, create a playlist or share a playlist with others. For instance,
    when you register to use the Dailymotion Service, we may collect your name,
    email address, birth date, gender, and other similar information. As a
    Partner (i.e. a member of the Dailymotion Partner Program), Dailymotion may
    also collect your payment information, such as your address, bank account
    details and authentication information, as well as billing, shipping and
    contact details. In addition, Dailymotion may collect information you
    provide to us when you respond to surveys, set your preferences on the
    Dailymotion Service, directly contact Dailymotion through the
    <a href="https://faq.dailymotion.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?">
        Dailymotion Help Center
    </a>
    or by other means, or agree to participate in promotions that Dailymotion
    may offer from time to time. Dailymotion also allows multiple profiles to
    be set up under one account, so we may collect information you provide to
    us if you create such profiles.
</p><p><u>1.3.b. Usage and Log Data.</u>
    We collect information when you use the Dailymotion Service or view
    Dailymotion advertising outside of the Dailymotion Service. We may also
    collect information from or about the computers, phones, tablets, or other
    devices where you install or access the Dailymotion Service, depending on
    the permissions you've granted. Examples of this information may include
    your IP address, device ID number, browser and software characteristics
    (such as type and operating system or language settings), activity on the
    Dailymotion Service including information about the videos you watch on the
    Dailymotion Service (e.g. video titles and categories), the frequency and
    duration of your activities, page views, ad data, referral URLs, network
    state, and carrier information.
</p><p><u>1.3.c. Account and Profile Data from Third-Party Services.</u>
    If you choose to log-in, access or otherwise connect to the Dailymotion
    Service, or contact Dailymotion, through a third-party service (e.g.,
    Facebook), we may collect your user ID and user name associated with that
    third-party service as well as any other information you make public using
    that service. We may also collect information you have authorized the
    third-party service to share with us (such as your user ID, billing
    information, public profile information, email address, birthday, friends
    list, pages you have "liked" and other account and profile data).
</p><p><u>1.3.d. Third-Party Data.</u>
    We may, if you authorized such third parties to share such information,
    receive information about you from other sources, such as data aggregators,
    public databases, and our business partners. Examples of this may include
    information (whether identified, de-identified or anonymous and whether
    collected online or offline) about your interests, demographic data,
    purchasing behavior, and your activities online (such as websites you have
    visited and/or advertisements you have viewed).
</p><p>
    We may combine the information we collect from or about you and use it in
    the manner described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise permitted by
    law.<strong></strong></p><p><u> 1.4. How the Data Is Collected.</u></p><p><u>1.4.a. Data Collected through Cookies and Similar Technologies.</u>
    Like many online services, we use various technologies to collect usage
    data and store preferences. The data collected helps us to propose, protect
    and improve the Dailymotion Service as well as to personalize your user
    experience by adapting the Content and advertising to your taste. The
    technologies we use are discussed below.
</p><p><ul><li><b><i>Cookies and Local Storage.</i></b> One technology we
    use is called a cookie, a small data file that is transferred to your
    computer’s hard disk. We may use both session cookies and persistent
    cookies to better understand how you interact with the Dailymotion Service
    or Dailymotion advertising published outside of the Dailymotion Service; to
    monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the
    Dailymotion Service; and to customize Content and advertising. We may
    create a unique device or user ID for you and store it in a cookie so we
    can customize your experience based on your preferences. These uses allow
    us to create a better experience for you on the Dailymotion Service. For
    further information on Dailymotion’s cookie management policy, please read
    out Cookie Policy available
    <a href="/legal/cookiemanagement?localization=en"><strong>here</strong>.
    </a>
    You may also decide to manage your cookie settings at any time by
    indicating which types of cookies you accept or refuse to receive by
    clicking on the cookie management page available at all times on the
    Dailymotion Service.
</p><p>
    We may collect information through other kinds of local storage (also
    referred to as "<strong>Flash cookies</strong>") and HTML5 local storage,
    including in connection with features such as volume/mute settings for the
    Video Player. Since these technologies are similar to browser cookies, they
    are sometimes referred to as "browser cookies" even though they may be
    stored in different parts of your computer.
</p><p>
    Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. By changing your
    browser settings, you can instruct your browser to stop accepting cookies
    or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. For
    further information on disabling cookies or deleting information contained
    in cookies in general, please click

        href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html"
    >
        here</a>.
    Please note that disabling cookies or deleting information contained in
    cookies or Flash cookies may interfere with the performance and features of
    the Dailymotion Service, including the Video Player. For example, we may
    not be able to store your preferences or login information or customize the
    Content and advertising to your viewing habits.
</p></li><li><b><i>Web Beacons or Pixels</i></b><em>.</em> In addition to
    cookies, we may use other technologies such as web beacons or pixel tags,
    which can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails. Web beacons or pixel
    tags are used to collect certain types of information from your browser or
    device; check whether you have viewed a particular web page, ad, or email
    message; and determine other usage details including: the time and date on
    which you viewed Content, the IP address of your computer, and the URL of
    the web page from which the Content was viewed.
</li><li><b><i>
            Mobile Device Identifiers and Software Development Kits ("SDKs").

    We may use or work with third parties, including our business partners and
    service providers, who use mobile SDKs to collect information such as
    advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA") and information related
    to how mobile devices interact with the Dailymotion Service. An SDK is
    computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads
    to be shown, data to be collected and related services and functionality to
    be implemented (a mobile SDK is in effect the mobile app version of a pixel
    tag or beacon, described above). For instance, we may use this technology
    to analyze how you interact with Content and advertisements and to enable
    analytics or other features through mobile devices.
</li><li>
    o The uses of these various technologies, notably in connection with
    advertising on the Dailymotion Service, are explained further below.
</li></ul></p><br><p><strong>2. PURPOSE FOR COLLECTING THIS DATA</strong></p><p>
    We collect Data because we are passionate about creating customized and
    engaging experiences for our users. We use all of the information we have
    to help us provide and support the Dailymotion Service with a first-class
    user experience. The way we use the Data we collect from or about you
    depends on how you use the Dailymotion Service.
</p><p>
Our purposes for the collection of the Data may include the following uses:    <u></u></p><p><u>2.1. Provide, Improve and Develop the Dailymotion Service.</u>
    We are able to deliver the Dailymotion Service, personalize the Content,
    evaluate how well the Content is performing, and make customized
    recommendations for you by using this information to understand how you use
    and interact with the Dailymotion Service and the things you’re interested
    in on and off our Services. For example, we collect your authentication
    data to allow you to connect to your account, and we collect information on
    your language setting preferences to provide you with the Dailymotion
    Service in the language of your choice. We may conduct surveys and
    research, test features in development and analyze the information that we
    have in order to evaluate and improve products and services, develop new
    products or features and conduct audits and troubleshooting activities.
</p><p><u>2.2. Communicate with You.</u>
    We may use your information to send you marketing communications,
    communicate with you about the Dailymotion Service and update you about our
    policies and terms. We also may use your information to respond to you when
    you contact us, or for any other purpose that is disclosed to you at the
    time we collect the Data or that is related to a request made by you. To
    learn about opting out of promotional communications, please see the
    information we have provided in Section 8 below (“Your Rights &amp;
    Opting-Out”).
</p><p><u>2.3. Show and Measure Ads and Services.</u>
    We may use the information we have to evaluate and improve our advertising
    and measurement systems so that we can show you relevant ads on and off our
    Services customized for you and measure the effectiveness and reach of ads
    and services. To learn about opting out of interest-based or online
    behavioral advertising, please see the information we have provided in
    Section 8 below ("Your Rights &amp; Opting-Out").<u></u></p><p><u>2.4. Pay You.</u>
    If you are a Dailymotion Partner, we use billing information, such as your
    billing address or payment methods to help provide the monetization
    features of the Dailymotion Service. For example, we use billing
    information to process payments to a Partner (using a third-party payment
    vendor), to retrieve account information for a Partner, and to detect abuse
    of the Dailymotion Service.
</p><p><u>2.5. Use of Precise Location Data.</u>
    In order to access certain services from your mobile device, you may be
    required to share with us your device’s location data (limited to the city
    level only). In addition to providing you with certain services, this also
    enables us to serve you Content related to your local area such as local
    news and sports videos, or to ensure the respect of Content
    geo-restrictions dictated by the Content uploader. This data may also be
    used to tailor advertising to you based on your location.
</p><p><u>2.6. Use of Aggregate or Anonymized Data.</u>
    In addition to any personally identifiable data use that is described in
    this Privacy Policy, we may aggregate information about you and other
    individuals together, or otherwise "de-identify" the Data about you
    (meaning that the Data is anonymized and aggregated so it no longer
    personally identifies you). We may use this “de-identified” information for
    any legitimate internal and external business purpose, including for
    research and analysis, administration of the Dailymotion Service,
    advertising (e.g. improving our targeting efforts), and business
    promotional purposes.
</p><p><u>2.7. Ensure Safety and Security.</u>
    We use the information we have to help verify accounts and activity, and to
    promote safety and security on and off our Services, such as by
    investigating suspicious activity or violations of our legal terms and
    policies. We work hard to protect your account using teams of engineers,
    automated systems and advanced technology such as encryption and machine
    learning<u>.</u></p><br><p><strong>3. DATA RECIPIENTS</strong></p><p>

    then such entities may be able to identify your browser details and
    associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other
    information that Facebook or Google already has about you. In addition,
    when you choose to share information about your activities on the
    Dailymotion Service with Facebook or Google, Dailymotion may send
    information about you to Facebook or Google. Facebook or Google may then
    make that information visible to Facebook users or Google users in
    accordance with applicable law, their respective data policies, and your
    Facebook or Google privacy settings. We recommend that you familiarize
    yourself with their data policies and account privacy controls. We remind
    you that Dailymotion is independent from these third party companies and
    that any privacy settings you might have chosen on the Dailymotion Service
    are not applicable on Facebook, Google or any other social network.
    </li></ul></p><p><u>3.3. Service Providers.</u>

</p><p><ul><li><em>Your Browsers and Devices.</em> We may work with service providers
    who use information collected from or about you to help us identify the
    browsers and devices you use for various purposes: including for targeted
    advertising, analytics, attribution, and measurement purposes. For example,
    these service providers (along with Dailymotion) may use your activity on
    one browser or device to serve you with more tailored advertising on
    another browser or device. They may also provide us with information about
    your current privacy settings on your device in order to allow us to
    respect your choices. In connection with your use of browsers and devices,
    please note that certain opt out choices you have (as described in Section
    8 (“Your Rights &amp; Opting-Out”)) apply only to the specific browser or
    device from which you opt out.
    </li></ul></p><p><u>3.4. Advertisers and Advertising-Related Service Providers.</u>
    We want our advertising to be relevant and interesting to you, therefore we
    may share the Data collected from or about you in encrypted, aggregated, or
    anonymized forms with advertisers and service providers that perform
    advertising-related services for us and our business partners in order to
    tailor advertisements, measure and improve advertising effectiveness, and
    enable other enhancements. This information includes Data on your online
    activities in relation to your use of the Dailymotion Service, such as the
    websites you have visited and advertisements you have viewed. For example,
    we may tell an advertiser how its ads performed, or how many people viewed
    their ads or installed an app after seeing an ad, or provide non-personally
    identifying demographic information (such as 25-year-old female, in New
    York) to these advertisers to help them understand their audience or
    customers, but only after the advertiser has agreed to abide by our Privacy
    Policy and strict confidentiality obligations. Please also note: we do not
    share directly identifiable information about you with advertisers and
    advertising-related service providers unless you give us express
    permission.
</p><p><u>3.5. Audience Measurement Providers.</u>
    Our business partners, such as content programmers, as well as our
    advertisers, seek to measure the performance of their creative material
    across many platforms, including the Dailymotion Service. Accordingly,
    Dailymotion may permit the use of third-party measurement software that
    enables third parties (e.g., Nielsen or comScore) to include your Content
    views on the Dailymotion Service in calculating measurement statistics. To
    learn more about your choices with respect to audience measurement
    software, please see the Data we have provided in Section 8 ("Your Rights
    &amp; Opting-Out ").
</p><p><u>
        3.6. Third Parties When Required by Law or When Necessary to Protect
        Your or Our Rights.</u>
    In some instances, we may be required to disclose information from or about
    you without providing you with notice or giving you the opportunity to
    consent. For example, we may disclose your information in good-faith in the
    following ways: to protect the legal rights of Dailymotion and our
    affiliates or partners, and each of our respective equity holders,
    directors, officers, employees, agents, and business partners; to protect
    the safety and security of users of the Dailymotion Service or third
parties; to enforce our    <a href="/legal?localization=en">Terms of Use</a>; to protect
    against fraud; for risk management purposes; and to comply with or respond
    to the law or legal process or a request for cooperation by a government
    entity. However, it is Dailymotion’s policy, whenever reasonably possible
    and legally permissible, to promptly notify you upon receipt of a subpoena
    or court order requesting your Data and to not produce your Data until
    after receipt of such subpoena or court order, so that you will have
    adequate opportunity to move to quash this request in court. Furthermore,
    if you notify us that you believe your legal rights have been violated by
    Dailymotion or another user of the Dailymotion Service, we may provide the
    Data that you provide to us to others to the extent that we believe it is
    necessary to evaluate and respond to your complaint.
</p><p><u>3.7. Third Parties in Connection with Certain Transactions.</u>
    If we sell all or part of our business, make a transfer of assets, or
    otherwise might be involved in a change of control transaction, or in the
    event of bankruptcy, we may transfer information from or about you to one
    or more third parties as part of the transaction, including as part of the
    due diligence process. Please note that in such a case your Data would be
    shared only as an integral part of the Dailymotion Service and not sold or
    transferred separately from the Service to third parties.

        3.8. Parties with Your Consent or When You Otherwise Choose to Share.</u>
    In addition to the sharing described in this Privacy Policy, we may share
    any information from or about you with any party when we have your consent
    or when you otherwise choose to share such information. Also, certain
    functions within the Dailymotion Service may give you the option to share

    takes all appropriate steps to limit the risk that it may be lost, damaged
    or misused. Our aim is to make you feel confident and safe when using the
    Dailymotion Service.
</p><p>
    We use a variety of physical, technical, and administrative measures to
    safeguard information in our possession against loss, theft and
    unauthorized use, disclosure, and modification. For example, we take steps
    to limit access to sensitive information from or about you to only those
    Dailymotion employees, agents, and contractors who have a legitimate
    business reason to access such information. We also use measures like
    encryption and hashing to help protect sensitive information when in
    transmission, and firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from
    gaining access to your personal information. We also use techniques such as
    data aggregation to render it more difficult to link and trace information
    to you.
</p><p>
    Despite these efforts, in today’s world there is always a possibility that
    a breach in data transmission or storage may occur. We want you to feel
    confident in our security when using the Dailymotion Service, but we cannot
    guarantee the security of any information from or about you 100% of the
    time.

    you permit to set up profiles under your account), they may be able to view
    information about your account or any of the profiles under your account,
    including information about the videos you view and your email address. You
    should take care of how you handle and disclose your personal information
    and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.
