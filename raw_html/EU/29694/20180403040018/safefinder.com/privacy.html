            <p>[Last Updated: March, 2015]</p>

We respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us.

            <p>The definitions in the <a href="http://safefinder.com/eula.html"> end user license agreement</a> apply to this policy unless stated otherwise. IN ADDITION TO THIS POLICY, PLEASE REVIEW OUR <a href="http://safefinder.com/eula.html"> END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT</a>, WHICH ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, TOGETHER WITH SUCH OTHER POLICIES OF WHICH YOU MAY BE NOTIFIED OF BY US FROM TIME TO TIME. </p>
            <p>Below we describe what information we collect when you use our Services, how we protect that information, how long we retain it, with whom do we share it, and what your privacy options are.  </p>
            <p>We will continue to evaluate this Privacy Policy against new technologies, business practices, and our users’ needs, and may make changes to the Privacy Policy accordingly.  Please check this page periodically for updates.  If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Privacy Policy here, along with its updated date, and notify you by means of a notice on our Website.  Your continued use of the Services after our posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you agree to be bound by such changes.</p>
            <p><u><b>What information do we collect about you?</b></u></p>
            <p>When you use the Search Application, you will be providing us with two types of information collected: (i) personal identifying information (“<b>PII</b>”) collected by us  through your use and interaction with the Services, or, provided by you when you submit a help request, a customer services inquiry or other inquiry to us, or fill in any other forms for the purposes of receiving our Services; interaction with the Search Application, and information which is obtained by you use of the Services; and (ii) non-personal identifying information (“<b>Non-PII</b>”) collected by us once you use, download or install the Search Application and Services. This Non-PII is aggregate non-identifying information, including without limitations, technical, statistic and aggregated information that does not identify you to us. </p>
            <p>Currently, we do not ask you to register to our Service and do not require the submission of any information that identifies you personally, such as your name, address and other PII unless you have commenced in a direct communications with us and we retained such communications and the accompanying information in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our Service.</p>
            <p>The non-PII collected is mainly statistical information we collect when you use of our Service, including, inter alia, advertisements viewed, the type of browser you are using as well as operating system, your time zone, the date and time you access the Service, screen resolution, browser and operating system language, VPN and Proxy services and ISP, default search, geo, etc.  </p>
            <p>We also collect information regarding your <b>usage of the Services</b> locally on your device, this information includes, among others, pages browsed and content viewed, offers and services that interest you, advertisement you were interested in, search quires and the time and date of your search, browsing history, interaction with social networks, and IP address, all as detailed herein.   </p>
            <p>While we would never collect any PII submitted to such websites, note that browsing history is aggregated separately for each specific IP, in order to continuously improve our products and provide the most relevant search results for each different location to better understand Internet trends statistics. That said, IP addresses, while identifying a device connected to the Internet, and its general location, are in themselves anonymous and contain no information regarding the identity of the ultimate person using the device – such identity is known solely to your ISP. Moreover, IP addresses assigned by ISPs are generally dynamic and subject to frequent change – static IP addresses are generally assigned only at subscriber's specific request and frequently require an additional fee.</p>
            <p>The data collected of your usage of the Service <b>may include</b> PII, as part of our privacy measures, we implement certain rules designed to avoid the unintentional collection of PII such as email addresses, social security numbers, credit card numbers, login information, etc. Such rules are based on known field types, parameters, values and algorithms but they are not foolproof and hence the Services may sometimes, unintentionally, collect unwanted information. </p>
