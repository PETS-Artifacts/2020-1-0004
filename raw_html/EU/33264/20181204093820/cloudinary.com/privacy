Changes to this Privacy Policy
</h3>
<p>
From time to time, we will update this policy. If the updates have minor if any consequences, they will take effect 7 days after we post a notice on the Service's website. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days after we initially posted the notice.
</p>
<p>
Until the new policy takes effect, if it materially reduces the protection of your privacy right under the then-existing policy you can choose not to accept it and terminate your use of the Service. Continuing to use the Service after the new policy takes effect means that you agree to the new policy. Note that if we need to adapt the policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective immediately or as required by law.
