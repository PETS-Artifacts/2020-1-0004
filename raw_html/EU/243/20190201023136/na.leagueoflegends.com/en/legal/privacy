    RIOT GAMES PRIVACY POLICY
</h1>
<div class="gray-stone">
  <p>
    Effective date: May 25, 2018.
  </p>
</div>
<br /><p>
  Welcome to Riot Games! Our privacy policy explains what info Riot Games collects when you visit the Riot services, as well as ways we might use or share it. We’re only describing our own practices – this policy doesn’t apply to third parties we don’t
  own or control, including other companies you might interact with on or through the Riot services (see <a href="#third-party">Third-Party Websites and Services</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Riot Games, Inc. and its subsidiaries are a global gaming company headquartered in Los Angeles with offices and operations around the world (see <a href="#international-data">International Data Processing</a>). When we say “Riot Games”, we’re referring
  to the Riot Games entity responsible for providing the Riot services in your region (see <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a> to see who that is).
</p>
<p>
  When we reference “the Riot services,” we mean League of Legends and any other games, websites, applications, and services that link to this policy, regardless of how you access or use them, including through mobile devices. Your use of the Riot services
  is also subject to the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> in your region (including its provisions regarding limitations on damages, resolution of disputes, and application of governing law).
  Please read this entire policy to make sure you understand it. You should also read the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> carefully, and make sure you understand and agree to them before using
  the Riot services.
</p>
<p>
  We encourage you to use the policy’s interactive features to guide you. We’ve written summaries to identify the key issues discussed in many sections at a glance. <strong><em>However, these summaries are intended solely to simplify things and the full policy should be read as it takes priority in the event of any ambiguity or conflicts (so be sure to read the whole thing carefully!).</em></strong>  Click on the “Learn More” buttons for further details about particular topics that interest you. To zip between sections, use the “Back To Top” buttons and the Table of Contents below.

  If you don’t understand any parts of the policy, <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a> with questions.

    <p>
      <strong>Summary:</strong> We collect info in three main ways:</p>
    <ul><li>You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).</li>
      <li>We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies).</li>
      <li>We receive some of it from third parties (like social media companies).</li>
    </ul><p>The particular kinds of info we gather usually depend on how you interact with us, like which Riot services you use and how you do so. </p>


    <br /><a id="info-you"></a>
    <h3>A. Info You Provide</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We collect info you choose to provide or give to us in any manner. You don’t have to share info when we ask you for it, but if you decline, you might not be able to access certain Riot services or take advantage of their
      full functionality.</p>

    <br /><div id="accordion" class="ui-accordion">
      <p class="accordion-header content-right">

        <a href="#info-you"><strong>Learn More</strong></a>
      </p>
      <div class="ui-accordion-content">
        <p>We collect info you enter or otherwise provide on the Riot services, including:</p>
        <ul><li>Your email address, date of birth, Summoner Name, and similar contact info (like when you <a target="_blank" href="https://play.na.leagueoflegends.com/en_US/signup">register for an account</a>);</li>

          <li> Your username, password, and other details that help us secure and provide access to the Riot services (like when you login to our games or websites);</li>

          <li>Your name, billing address, telephone number, payment method, and other details we collect to help process purchases you make (like when you buy Riot Points or shop at our Merch Store);</li>

          <li>Your support-related info, including the nature of your concern and your account or order details (like when you request help from us, such as by submitting a Player Support ticket);</li>

          <li>Your preferences, interests, and general demographic info (such as your hobbies, favorite games, or other info you share, like when you respond to a survey);</li>

          <li>Info you share with us in connection with contests or promotions (like to submit an entry, prove your eligibility, or claim a prize if you win); and</li>

          <li>
            <p>Your Riot Games account info (like your preferred game settings, key bindings, friends list, and mastery and rune pages).</p></li>
        </ul>
        The Riot services also offer social features like forums and chat. When you use these features, the info you share is public info – this means we may collect and use the info you provide (including to enforce our <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>,
        such as described in <a href="#anticheat-info">Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</a> and <a href="#pb-info">Chat &amp; Player Behavior</a> below), and in some cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge (for example, if you’re
        chatting with another player while they stream a League of Legends match). 
        <p>When you play multiplayer games like League of Legends, note that some info will be publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We may record gameplay and related info (such as Summoner Name, build order, and in-game
          actions), and replay or otherwise make it available to other players without further notice to you. For example, players can watch each other play League of Legends using <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/spectator-faq">Spectator Mode</a>,
          and we may use gameplay footage to help promote the Riot services.</p>

    <h3>C. Info We Collect From Third Parties</h3>
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Sometimes we obtain info from third parties to use along with the info we collect. For example, if you link your Facebook account with your Riot Games account, Facebook may share info with us in accordance with Facebook’s
      privacy policy and your privacy settings on it.</p>

      </p>
      <div class="ui-accordion-content">

        <p>We may collect info from third parties to supplement the info you provide and the info we collect automatically. For example:</p>
        <ul><li>We obtain info from third parties if you use their services in connection with the Riot services (such as linking your Facebook account with the Riot services via the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/features/faq-add-friends">Add Friends</a>            feature). Your privacy settings on the third party’s service control what info they share with us. Please make sure you’re comfortable with what they might share by reviewing their posted policies, and if applicable, modifying your privacy
            settings directly on their service.</li>

          <li> We gather advertising and analytics info from third parties to help support our marketing initiatives, improve the Riot services, and better manage our ad campaigns (like by displaying more personalized ads and measuring how effective they are).
            To learn more about these companies, see <a href="#info-analytics">Analytics &amp; Interest-Based Ads</a>.</li>

          <li>We collect info from third parties to help us identify where you’re using the Riot services from (like your approximate location based on your IP address). This helps us, for example, process purchases (like assessing tax obligations), prevent
            fraud or abuse of the Riot services (such as identifying suspicious transactions or activity), and customize your visit (like displaying the Riot services in your local language).</li>

          <li>We’ll also receive info from third-party platforms (like iTunes or Google Play) if you download the Riot services (such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/download-free-league-friends-mobile-app">League Friends</a>            app) on your mobile device.

    <h3>A. Cookies &amp; Related Technologies </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>Summary: </strong> We use our own servers and technologies like cookies to automatically collect and store info about how you interact with the Riot services, as well as the device you use to do so.

        <p>“Cookies” are small pieces of data that online services you use place on your device for record-keeping and identification purposes. “Web beacons” are transparent pixel images that allow online services to collect info about the ways you interact
          with them (like whether you’ve opened an email or clicked on an ad). Similar common technologies include things like tags, scripts, local shared objects (e.g., Flash cookies), local storage (e.g., HTML5), and related tools.</p>
        <p>The Riot services use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to automatically collect, store, and read files on your device. They may be delivered in a first-party (i.e., by Riot Games) or third-party (i.e., by other companies) context.
          These tools help the Riot services work and operate more efficiently, as well as capture info about how you interact with us (see <a href="#what-info">Info We Collect</a>).</p>
        <p>We also use our servers in connection with these technologies to collect info about the ways you interact with the Riot services and store it in log files. This may include, for example, info that your device, browser, or operating system sends
          to us when you access the Riot services (like device IDs, IP addresses, and hardware or software specifications) and details about how you use your Riot Games account (like the particular features you use, your in-game interactions and statistics,
          and other similar info).</p>
        <p>We use info gathered through technologies like cookies for several reasons, including:</p>
        <ul><li>To monitor, secure, and maintain the Riot services (like preventing fraud);</li>

          <li>To enhance your browsing experience (such as allowing you to log-in to your account);</li>

          <li>To analyze and improve our operations (like aggregating traffic and usage patterns);</li>

          <li>To control the display of ads (including providing you with targeted offers);</li>

          <li>To support and gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns (like letting us know if you’ve clicked on our ads or opened our emails);</li>

        <p>In addition to the technologies we place, other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you visit the Riot services. This includes vendors we’ve engaged to provide services on our behalf (like website analytics), as well as third
          parties that deliver content (like videos from YouTube) or offers (like ads from ad networks) contained on the Riot services. We may receive reports based on our partners’ use of these tools on an individual or aggregate basis. </p>
        <p>For example, we use third-party analytics providers (like Google Analytics) to help evaluate and report on use of the Riot services. We also partner with ad companies to support our marketing efforts, including by serving you ads better tailored
          to your likely interests (such as based on your browsing activity on the Riot services and when visiting other online services). These companies may set and read their own cookies and similar technologies to gather info about your online activities
          across websites and services. </p>
        <p>Some analytics providers and ad companies offer you choices about how they collect and use info directly on their websites. To learn more about opting out of Google Analytics, click <a target="_blank" href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>.

          the ads you do receive won’t be interest-based any longer and therefore might be less relevant to your interests.</p>

    <h3>B. Sharing Info</h3>

    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> We don’t share info that directly identifies you (such as your email or home address) with independent third parties without your knowledge except as described in this policy (like to enforce the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>,
      secure the Riot services, or if we’re required to do so by law). We do share info that doesn’t directly identify you (like your Summoner Name, match history, game stats, and other aggregate or anonymous info), including publicly via the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.riotgames.com/ ">Riot Games API</a>.</p>

    <p>If we ever stop providing Riot services (like if we’re bought out or invaded by Yordles), we may share your info with the buyer. Lastly, remember the stuff you share in social features (like chat and forums) is public -- please be careful about how
      you use them!</p>

      <div class="ui-accordion-content">

        <p>We share the info we collect with Riot Games-controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to help us more seamlessly operate, support, and improve the Riot services (such as to facilitate account transfers and provide Player Support in your local language).
          Since we’re a global company, this means your info may be transferred to or stored in locations outside your country of residence (see <a href="#international-data">International Data Processing</a>). To learn more about the Riot Games entity
          responsible for providing the Riot services in your region, see <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a> below.</p>
        <p>We also share info with service providers that operate on our behalf for the purposes discussed in this policy. For example, when you buy something on the Riot services, we’ll share your payment-related info with entities we’ve engaged to process
          payments and provide similar financial services (like fraud prevention). Other common examples include partners that help us store data, send marketing emails, and provide Player Support services. </p>
        <p>If you share info publicly through interactive features we control, such as forums and chat, you should understand that this info is public not private. We reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor your use of them, including for purposes
          like enforcing our <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> and applicable player behavior requirements (see <a href="#pb-info">Chat &amp; Player Behavior</a> and <a href="#anticheat-info">Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</a>).
          To request removal of your info from forums or similar features controlled by Riot Games, <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>.</p>
        <p>We may disclose player info in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar
          proceedings). This means your info may be one of the assets transferred to the acquiring entity in such situations. </p>
        <p>Please note that your Summoner Name and gameplay statistics (like your match history, item builds, and average number of kills and deaths) are public info that may be shared in-game and out-of-game with players and other third parties. This includes
          info we share with the League of Legends developer community via the <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.riotgames.com/">Riot Games API</a> so they can help contribute to the player experience.</p>
        <p>We may also use, disclose, and preserve info to:</p>

    <h3>C. Chat &amp; Player Behavior</h3>


    <p>We’ve empowered our players to help police compliance with our policies related to certain in-game behavior. For example, League of Legends players may report each other and submit descriptions of their in-game activity and actions to help us determine
      if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and procedures that apply to player conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions). </p>
    <p>We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor, chat and similar details about in-game interactions for a period we determine in our sole discretion is appropriate to help us, among other things, detect and prevent
      toxicity, enforce our rules and policies, and foster a more positive gaming community for our players. We use both manual (like many Player Support tickets) and automated (such as machine learning) tools and techniques to support these efforts.</p>
    <p>Please be kind to other players, observe our policies related to player behavior (including our <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>), and always be careful what you share in chat!</p>

    <br /><a id="anticheat-info"></a>
    <h3>D. Anti-Cheat &amp; Fraud Prevention</h3>

    <p>We always seek to offer players a fair, fun, and competitive gaming experience on the Riot services. Our <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a> strictly prohibit use of unauthorized third-party
      programs that interact with the Riot services, including mods, hacks, cheats, scripts, bots, trainers, and automation programs. When you create or use a Riot Games account, purchase things from us, play our games, or otherwise interact with the
      Riot services, we may use anti-cheat and fraud prevention technologies that may make automated decisions (such as temporary or permanent account suspensions or chat restrictions) based on the info we collect from or about you (see <a href="#what-info">Info We Collect</a>).
      This primarily helps us enforce our rules and policies, secure the Riot services, detect and prevent unauthorized activity, and maintain the competitive integrity of our games. </p>

          by law. You can also limit the info you share with third parties, such as by choosing not to link your Riot Games account with third-party services (see <a href="#third-party">Third-Party Websites And Services</a>).</p>
        <p>We offer players choices about the types of communications they receive from Riot Games. If you choose to receive marketing and promotional emails from us but later change your mind, simply “unsubscribe” by following the instructions in the relevant
          email. These choices don’t apply to mandatory communications that are part of the Riot services, like important account-related notices.</p>
        <p>The Riot services also have many built-in tools to help players exercise control over their info directly. For example, you can generally delete old forum posts, mute or disable voice chat functionality, and change other preferences from your
          account settings. If you need help with any of these options, be sure to <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>.</p>
        <p>Many Internet browsers allow you to reject, manage, and delete cookies. You may also be able to manage other similar technologies, like HTML5, by changing your browser settings (see <a href="#info-auto">Info We Collect Automatically</a>).</p>
        <p>If you don’t want to take advantage of the services that third-party analytics and advertising companies provide on the Riot services, you may be able to opt-out of some of them by visiting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a>          or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>, or if you’re located in the EU or Canada, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/</a>          or <a target="_blank" href="http://youradchoices.ca/">http://youradchoices.ca/</a> respectively. </p>
        <p>If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your info, or would like to update or delete the personal info associated with your Riot Games account, please <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>. Note that asking us to remove personal info or
          refrain from processing it may also result in account suspension or termination, in which case you’ll no longer be able to access many of the Riot services. We may also retain certain info associated with your account for purposes like complying
          with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud, resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this policy and the <a target="_blank" href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/legal/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a>.</p>
        <p>You can request access to the personal info we hold about you by visiting <a target="_blank" href="https://privacy.riotgames.com">privacy.riotgames.com</a> and following the instructions provided. You can also submit any account-related questions
          or concerns you may have (including access requests) directly to our Player Support team (see <a href="#contact-us">Contact Us</a>). </p>

        <p>Before we process requests to access, update, delete, or otherwise process personal info in different ways, we may ask you to verify your identity (like by logging-in to your account or providing us with certain info to help us confirm ownership)
          and we may request payment where allowed by law. </p>
