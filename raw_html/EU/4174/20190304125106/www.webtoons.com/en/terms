The company uses the information it gets from Google Analytics only to improve this site.

The company does not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google.

						<h3>WEBTOON Ad revenue sharing program terms of service</h3>
						<p class="date">Effective as of August 1, 2018</p>
						<p>
							<em class="bold">THESE TERMS OF SERVICE ("TERMS") SET OUT BELOW GOVERN YOUR PARTICIPATION IN THE WEBTOON AD REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM. PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AS THEY CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES AND OBLIGATIONS.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							The WEBTOON AD REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM (the "Program") is operated by WEBTOON ENTERTAINMENT Corp ("WEBTOON" or "we"), a Delaware corporation and US subsidiary of NAVER WEBTOON Corp., a Korean company ("NAVER"). While NAVER provides the service of the WEBTOON Website and APP ("Service") to users, WEBTOON operates the WEBTOON AD REVENUE SHARING PROGRAM in accordance with these Terms.
						</p>
						<h4>General</h4>
						<p>
							The Program provides a participatory revenue stream to those creators who (i) become a Member, defined below, of the Program in accordance with these Terms, and (ii) thereafter, elect to allow the placement of advertising in association with series owned by such creators and published on the Service. Specifically, upon applying for participation in the Program and electing to allow for the placement of such advertising, the participating creators ("Members") will receive a portion of the Net Ad Revenue, defined below, generated by WEBTOON from such advertising, as set forth in these Terms.
							<br>Only those creators who become Members in the Program in accordance with these Terms and whose content is approved by WEBTOON for Ad Display, defined below, will be entitled to share in the Net Ad Revenue.
						</p>
						<p>
							<em class="bold">THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT MEMBERS WILL RECEIVE NET AD REVENUE AS A RESULT OF THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM.</em>
						</p>
						<p>
							These Terms of Service, together with the Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, Discover Policy and other applicable policies and terms of WEBTOON and/or NAVER constitute the entire agreement by and among NAVER, WEBTOON and you (the "Agreement"). (For purposes of the Agreement and these Terms, "you" means the individual or entity using the Service and/or applying to participate in the Program (and/or any individual, agent, employee, representative, network, parent, subsidiary, affiliate, successor, related entities, assigns, or all other individuals or entities acting on your behalf, at your direction, under your control, or under the direction or control of the same individual or entity who controls you) and thereafter, if accepted by WEBTOON, becomes a Member. Capitalized terms not defined in these Terms are defined elsewhere in the Agreement.
							<br>By participating in the PROGRAM or clicking on the "Agree" button below, you agree to be bound by the Agreement, including these Terms. NAVER and WEBTOON reserve the right to modify or amend these Terms and/or the Agreement at any time by publishing an amended version on the WEBTOON Website and/or the WEBTOON App. Although NAVER and WEBTOON will try to notify you when major changes are made to the Agreement and/or these Terms, you should periodically review the most up-to-date version thereof, as you will be bound by the terms of the most current form of the Agreement and these Terms. Changes to the Agreement and/or these Terms will generally become effective 30 days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for the Program or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to any modifications or amendments to these Terms and/or the Agreement, your sole recourse is to immediately cancel your membership in the Program, as provided at your dashboard, and to cease using the Service.
							<br>Please read these Terms and the Agreement carefully. Your participation in the Program is only as permitted by these Terms and any applicable laws.

If your request is disapproved due to content related issues, you may reapply after revising your content in accordance with the Discover Policy. You can check the review status of your application in the ‘AD SHARING’ tab on your dashboard.

									</li>
									<li>
										<strong><span class="num">2 . 4</span>Approved Series</strong>
										<p>In the event WEBTOON approves your requested series for Ad Display ("Approved Series"), WEBTOON will thereafter seek to embed advertising into the Approved Series.

You have no right to select the advertisers, type or content of any Ad Display and/or the placement thereof within your Approved Series. In the event you do not wish to exhibit any Ad Display embedded into your Approved Series by WEBTOON, your sole right and remedy is to opt out of the Program, which you can do at any time. In furtherance of the foregoing, please consider that the actual advertisers and the content of each advertisement constituting any Ad Display will be automatically determined by WEBTOON’s ad platforms (e.g. Google or Facebook) through their respective systems and without input or direction from WEBTOON unless the advertisement is placed as the result of a direct sale.

WEBTOON cannot grant you any permission to use another creator’s content, nor can it release any creator’s contact information. Even if you have received the copyright owner’s permission in writing to publish the subject content (which you agree to provide to WEBTOON upon request by WEBTOON), WEBTOON may, in its sole discretion, disapprove Ad Display related to such content, cancel your participation in the Program, or withhold or refuse to distribute any Net Ad Revenues in the event any person or entity raises any copyright infringement or other claims related to the subject content. Furthermore, you agree to indemnify and hold WEBTOON and NAVER, together with their respective officers, directors, owners, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, agents and employees, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, actions, costs and expenses related to or arising from your use of such content, including, without limitation, violation of any governing copyright laws.</p>

										<strong><span class="num">4 . 1</span>Payment Conditions</strong>
										<p>
											You are only entitled to payment of Net Ad Revenue if the balance in your Account exceeds the minimum threshold amount of US$100. Furthermore, monthly payments to you are released only in US$100 increments and you are not entitled to receive payment of amounts less than US$100.
											<br><em class="bold">Note! You do NOT have the right to payment for amounts in your Account which are less than the minimum threshold amount of US$100 or are less than $US100 per payment.</em>

									<li>
										<strong><span class="num">4 . 2</span>Payment Schedule</strong>
										<p>The balance in your Account will be updated on the 21st day of the following month and displayed on the AD SHARING Tab as of that date. You will not receive a separate email notification respecting payment updates. Provided you are in compliance with the Agreement and these Terms, in each month in which the current balance in your Account exceeds the minimum threshold amount of US$100, you will receive payment <em class="bold">not later than the 15th day of the then following month of amounts in your Account equal to US$100 increments,</em> provided, however, that WEBTOON reserves the right to delay payment of sums owing to you hereunder in the event it suspects you have violated the Agreement and/or these Terms.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong><span class="num">4 . 3</span>Payment Method: Patreon ID</strong>
										<p>In order to receive payment, <em class="bold">you must register with and maintain a valid Patreon ID</em> in the AD SHARING Tab on your dashboard. WEBTOON is not responsible for any wrongly or unpaid Net Ad Revenue due to incorrectly entered Patreon account information. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong><span class="num">4 . 4</span>Payment Restrictions</strong>
										<p>
											You will not be entitled to payment of any Net Ad Revenue in your Account, whenever such Net Ad Revenue was accrued, in the event you are in violation of this Agreement, these Terms and/or any governing laws and/or regulations, as determined by WEBTOON or NAVER, in their sole discretion.
											<br>The fact that your AD SHARING Tab may show a balance in your Account does not in any way guarantee payment to you of that amount so displayed or any other amount.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<strong><span class="num">4 . 5</span>Payment Example</strong>
										<p>Let’s say you had a previous balance of US$20 in your Account as of June 1.</p>
										<ul>
											<li><span class="sign">•</span>If you have earned US$70 of Net Ad Revenue during June, that amount will appear on your dashboard on July 21st. In this case, your balance would then be US$90 (previous balance of US$20 + your June Net Ad Revenue sharing of US$70). However, there would be no payment in July, as your balance did not meet the minimum threshold amount of US$100. The balance of $90 carries over to the next month.</li>
											<li><span class="sign">•</span>If you have earned US$110 during June, your balance would then equal US$130 (previous balance of US$20 + June your portion of the Net Ad Revenue of US$110) on July 21st and you would be paid US$100 by the end of July. Your Account will have US$30 as a remaining balance after payment, and the US$30 carries over to the next month.</li>

										<strong><span class="num">4 . 6</span>Taxes</strong>
										<p class="bold">You are solely responsible for the payment of all taxes (if any) associated with your participation in the Program, including your receipt of any Net Ad Revenue, as well as the preparation and timely filing of all documentation required by taxing authorities having jurisdiction over you and/or your activities. All payments to you from WEBTOON, whether through Patreon or otherwise, in relation to the Program will be treated as inclusive of tax (if applicable) and will not be adjusted.</p>
										<p class="bold">Note! If you cancel your membership in the Ad Revenue Sharing Program or delete your Account at any time in which there is a balance of $10 or more in your Account, WEBTOON will pay you amounts in excess of $10.
