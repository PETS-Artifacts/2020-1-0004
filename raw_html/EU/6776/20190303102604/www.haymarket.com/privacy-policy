<h2 id="collection-of-your-personal-data">Collection of your personal data</h2>
<h3 id="personal-data-you-provide-directly-to-us">Personal data you provide directly to us</h3>
<p>We collect personal data from you when you enquire about or request a product or service directly from us. For example you will provide personal data to us when you;</p>
<ul>

<li>enter a competition or prize draw</li>
</ul>
<p>The information we routinely collect will include your contact details (e.g. name, email address, phone number and postal address). We will also collect specific information where relevant for a particular service. For example, you would provide your car registration number if requesting a vehicle valuation or you may choose to upload your CV when using one of our job sites.</p>
<p>When you register to attend one of our events, we may also collect details about your dietary and accessibility requirements. We only collect this information with your explicit consent and will only use it for the purposes of your attendance at the event.</p>
<p>To learn more please see <a href="#heading-5">How we use your personal data.</a></p>
<h3 id="when-you-visit-our-sites">When you visit our websites</h3>
<p>When you visit one of our websites for the first time, you will receive a "pop-up" notice informing you that we use Cookies. Some personal data (for example a unique identifier, your IP address and geographical location) will be collected through our and our technology partners' use of cookies and similar technologies. To learn more please see our <a href="#heading-12">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>
<h3 id="from-other-organisations-or-publicly-available-sources">From other organisations or publicly available sources</h3>
<p>We sometimes combine information we have collected from our websites or other sources, with information received from other organisations. This is used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>verify the personal data we hold for you (e.g. to check your postal address is correct)</li>
<li>enhance the content and relevance of the advertising we provide to you. To learn more please see <a href="#subgroup-9">Personalisation of marketing &amp; website content</a> and our <a href="#heading-12">Cookie Notice</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also research publicly available sources (e.g. websites and LinkedIn) and use external suppliers, to identify business contacts who are likely to be interested in the products and services we have to offer. We will only collect the minimal amount of information required for this purpose (e.g. name, job title, company and contact details) and when we contact you we will always provide you with an easy way to object to us continuing to retain your personal data.</p>
<h2 id="the-lawful-basis-we-rely-on">The lawful bases we rely on</h2>
<p>Under the GDPR there are six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data. We have identified four which we rely upon for our business activities: Consent, Contractual, Legitimate Interests and Legal Obligation.</p>
<p>Contractual - in many circumstances we rely on the lawful basis of "performance of a contract", this enables us to respond to you when you express an interest in our products and services and to fulfil any requests. To learn more please see <a href="#subgroup-7">Fulfilment of a service</a>.</p>
<p>Consent - in some circumstances we rely on your specific consent, whereby you actively agree and "opt-in". We will always make it clear how you can withdraw you consent at any time. To learn more please see <a href="#heading-6">How to stop marketing communications</a>.</p>
<p>Legal Obligation - there will be circumstances under which we are legally obliged to hold your personal data or required to disclose it to a third party by law.</p>
<p>Legitimate Interests - for some of our activities we rely on our legitimate business interests to collect and use your personal data.

<h2 id="protecting-children">Protecting children</h2>
<p>All of our brands are aimed at adults and are not designed for use by children. However, we accept that on occasion children may visit our websites. Where we believe any of our brands may attract children under the age of 16, we will clearly provide information notices to try and deter children from providing their personal data.</p>
<p>We clearly stipulate that entry into any of our competitions is only available to over 18s. In exceptional circumstances we may lower this, but never lower than 16 and this will always be clearly stipulated in the terms and conditions for the specific competition.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly intend to send marketing communications to children.</p>
<p>We actively encourage all our staff, whenever they are implementing new promotions, offers or events to assess whether these might be attractive to children and if so, will ensure clear information is provided to try and deter children from providing their personal data.</p>

<h2 id="storage-security-retention">Keeping your data secure</h2>
<h3 id="where-we-store-your-personal-data">Where we store and process your personal data</h3>
<p>Ensuring your personal data is kept and transferred securely is of the highest importance to us.</p>
<p>We hold your personal data on our secure systems, mainly based within the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA). Please also see <a href="#subgroup-21">How we keep your personal data secure</a>. Where we employ service providers, we have appropriate agreements in place to ensure your personal data is protected.</p>
<p>Your personal data may be transferred to a country outside the European Economic Area (EEA). This may be required for the purposes of our staff based outside the EEA or where a supplier of a service is based outside the EEA. We will take all reasonable steps necessary to ensure your personal data is treated securely. This includes Model Contractual Arrangements as approved by the European Commission, and the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-keep-your-personal-data-secure">How we keep your personal data secure</h3>
<p>We are committed to protecting the security of the personal data we hold. We deploy appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure your personal data is kept securely and to prevent any unauthorised access.

<h3 id="how-long-do-we-keep-your-personal-data">How long do we keep your personal data</h3>

We will only keep your personal data for a reasonable period of time and we base this on the purpose for which we are using it.</p>
<p>There will be circumstances in which we keep a strictly minimal amount of information about you, for example to ensure we can honour an objection to receiving direct marketing. We will also, in specific circumstances, be required to retain personal data for a longer period of time for contractual or legal reasons.</p>
<p>We have a detailed internal schedule for ensuring we do not hold your personal data for longer than we justifiably need it. To learn more please use <a href="#subgroup-2">Our contact details</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Reporting-security-vulnerabilities">Reporting security vulnerabilities</h3>

Please email us at <a href="mailto:data.protection@haymarket.com">data.protection@haymarket.com</a> and we will respond to you as soon as possible. This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue. Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability could put the wider community at risk, and therefore we encourage you to come to us first. We'll keep you informed as we move forward with our investigations.</p>
<h2 id="cookie-notice">Cookie Notice</h2>
<p>The aim of our Cookie Notice is to provide you with a summary of the tracking technologies we use and how you can control what is set and when. We keep our Cookie Notice under regular review to best reflect the technology we use on our sites.</p>
<h3 id="cookies-and-tracking-technologies-we-use">Cookies and tracking technologies we use</h3>
<p>Where Haymarket Media Group Ltd or its group companies talk about cookies and tracking technology on our websites (please see <a href="#subgroup-3">Our brands</a>) we refer to the following:</p>
<h4 id="flash-cookies">Flash Cookies</h4>
<p>A local shared object, sometimes called a "Flash cookie," is a data file that can be created on your computer by the websites you visit. They are most often used to enhance your web-browsing experience. Adobe's website provides details regarding <a href="https://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/privacy.html" target="_blank">Flash Cookies</a></p>
<h4 id="web-beacons">Web Beacons</h4>
<p>To help us better manage content we employ web beacons in emails that we send to our subscribers. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier and are used to track the online movements of internet users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on websites. We use them in our HTML-based emails to learn which emails have been opened by recipients enabling us to gauge the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.</p>
<h4 id="pixels">Pixels</h4>
<p>A pixel refers to the code that is placed on your computer in order to trigger a cookie. We sometimes use this methodology to allow us to deliver more relevant messages to you e.g. to understand how you interact with our email marketing.</p>
<h4 id="log-files">Log Files</h4>
<p>We use log files to record events that occur on our websites. This may include, though not exclusively, the type, content or time of transaction made via your device. These audit trails allow us to analyse activities on our websites.</p>
<h3 id="how-and-why-we-use-cookies-and-tracking-technologies">How and why we use cookies and tracking technologies</h3>
<h4 id="types-of-cookies-and-how-they-are-set">Types of Cookies and how they are set</h4>
<p>There are two types of cookies:</p>
<ol>
<li>"Session Cookies" - Stored temporarily in your computer's memory while you are visiting a website and are deleted when you close your browser.</li>
<li>"Persistent Cookies" - Stored for a set period on your computer and used to determine whether there has been any contact between us and your computer in the past.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two ways cookies set can be on our websites:</p>
<ol>
<li>"1st Party Cookies" - cookies that are set by the website domain (or belonging to a sub domain) of the website.</li>
<li>"3rd Party Cookies" - cookies that are set by another website domain. (e.g. by <a href="#our-main-technology-partners">one of our main technology partners</a> or by an <a href="#external-web-services">external web services</a>)</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cookies-classification">Cookies Classification</h4>
<p>We are categorising cookies set on the site by ourselves and our main technology partners into the following categories:</p>
<p><strong>Category 1: Strictly necessary cookies</strong><br />These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around a website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, services you've asked for (such as access to secure areas) can't be provided. These cookies don't gather information about you that can be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Category 2: Performance cookies</strong><br />These cookies collect information about how you use a website, for example which pages you go to most often and if you get any error messages from certain pages. These cookies don't gather information that identifies you. All information these cookies collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how our website works. These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising. Without these cookies we can't learn how our website is performing and make relevant improvements that could better your browsing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Category 3: Functionality cookies</strong><br />These cookies allow a website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. For instance, they can be used to remember log-in details, changes you've made to text size, font and other parts of pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you've asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. These cookies may be used to ensure that all our services and communications are relevant to you. The information these cookies collect cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience.</p>
<p><strong>Category 4: Targeting and advertising cookies</strong><br /> We use these to provide adverts on our sites that we believe are more relevant to you. Without these cookies, online adverts you encounter will be less relevant to you and your interests. We also enable some advertising partners to set cookies specifically to enable them to analyse advertising campaign performance.</p>
