            posting of changes to this Privacy Policy means that you agree to be bound by such changes.

        <p><b>How To Control Or Delete Cookies</b>:<br/>

        <p>Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. Users can usually set their browsers to
            block all third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting
            information on websites operated by other companies), block all cookies (including first-party
            cookies such as the ones IAC Publishing Labs uses to collect search activity information about its users), or
            block specific cookies. These settings will typically be found in the &#8220;options&#8220; or
            &#8220;preferences&#8221; menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the
            following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the &#8220;Help&#8221;option in your
            browser for more details.

        <p><b>Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile.</b> Advertisers and advertising networks place ads
            (including sponsored links in search results) on our website and in our mobile applications.
            These companies, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may use cookies, pixel
            tags, mobile device IDs and other similar technologies to collect data about you when you visit
            our site. They use the data to enable them to track your activity across various sites where
            they display ads and record your activities, so they can show ads that they consider relevant to
            you. You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from advertising networks that is
            delivered on reference.com and other websites by visiting the following websites:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Network Advertising Initiative (<a href="//www.networkadvertising.org/">www.networkadvertising.org/</a>)
            </li>

        <p>Please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop
            cookies on our website.
        </p>

        <p>If you are using an IAC Publishing Labs mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to
            recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings.
            Advertising companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that they
            consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.</p>

        <p>If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that
            relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: <a
                    href="//oo.apple.com/">oo.apple.com</a>. If you are using an iOS6 device,
            you also may limit the delivery of tailored ads by: Open Settings and tap &#8220;General&#8221;
            then tap &#8220;About&#8221;; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap &#8220;Advertising&#8221;;
            Flip &#8220;Limit Ad Tracking&#8221; to ON. If you are using an Android device and you do not
            wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can visit Google&#8217;s <a
                    href="//www.google.com/ads/preferences/">Ads Preferences</a> page from a browser on
            your device and make your choices there. We do not control how the applicable platform operator
            allows you to control receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the
            platform provider if the above options are no longer available.</p>

        <p><b>Mobile Device Location Information.</b>
            When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a
            mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location
            (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location
            information was recorded. Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to
            work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about
            you. We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing our services. If
            you wish to use the particular feature, you will be asked to consent to your data being used for
            this purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time by disabling the relevant feature. If
            you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile
            device, please follow these instructions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> If you are using an Apple device, click on &#8220;General,&#8221; then &#8220;Reset,&#8221;
                then &#8220;Reset Location and Privacy.&#8221; This will turn off location functionality for
                all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again
                to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information.
            </li>
            <li> If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click &#8220;Location,&#8221;
                and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable
                location services.
            </li>
            <li>
                If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device
                location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to
                disable the collection of this information.
            </li>
        </ul>  <br/>
        <p><b>5. Reviewing, changing or deleting information</b></p>

        <p>If you would like to review, change or delete personal information we have collected from you,
            please contact the IAC Publishing Labs Privacy Officer:
        </p>

            Oakland, CA 94607</p>

        <p><b>Do Not Track.</b> Do Not Track (&#8220;DNT&#8221;) is a privacy preference that users can set
            in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not
            want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or
            online services.
            We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our
            website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative
            and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or
            respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working
            toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach
            to responding to DNT.
        </p><br/><br/>

        <p><b>6. How do we keep the information we collect secure? </b></p>

        <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and
            organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful
            processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. We also limit access to personal
            information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or
            services to you, or in order to do their jobs. However, because no security system can be 100%
            effective, we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected
            from or about you.
        </p><br/><br/>

        <p><b>7. How long do we keep the information we collect?</b></p>

        <p>We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a
            business purpose or comply with a legal request. We may also choose to anonymize certain of the
            information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to
            retain it for longer periods of time.
        </p><br/><br/>

        <p><b>8. Children under 13</b></p>

        <p>The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any
            personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a person submitting
            information is under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible. You
            hereby represent that you are at least 13.
        </p><br/><br/>

        <p><b>9. Consent to Transfer of Information </b></p>

        <p>If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to
            and stored in our servers in the U.S. By using the Services, you consent to our collection and
            use of your data as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
