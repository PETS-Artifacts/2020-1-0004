<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">What lawful bases do we rely on for processing?</span></strong></p>
<p>In order to process your personal data, we must have a lawful reason for doing so. GDPR sets out six lawful bases under which organisations can collect, use and store personal data. We rely on four of the lawful bases:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Necessary for the performance of a contract</span><br />
If you are our customer, for example a subscriber of a magazine or an attendee at one of our events, we will process your personal data on the basis that it is necessary for us to provide our products and services to you.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Consent</span><br />
In some instances we rely on your specific consent to process your personal information. This is where you have actively agreed and ‘opted-in’, for example to receive marketing communications from us, and you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Compliance with laws</span><br />
We may have to process and share your personal data in order to comply with our legal obligations, or to protect our rights or the rights of others. For example, we are required to collect certain information from you when processing your subscription payment for tax or financial reporting reasons.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Legitimate interests</span><br />
In some situations we rely on our legitimate business interests in order to collect and use your personal data. In these situations, we have conducted a balancing test to carefully consider the impact of the processing on your interests, rights and freedoms. We will only undertake the processing if we are satisfied there is no negative impact on you. We rely on Legitimate Interests for the following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>providing, maintaining, improving and developing our products and services;</li>
<li>sending direct marketing communications about our products and services to customers;</li>
<li>sending marketing communications related to the products and services of carefully selected companies in a business-to-business context;</li>
<li>managing suppression and unsubscribe requests;</li>
<li>
<p id="3">researching publicly available business contact details;</p>
</li>
<li>managing certain aspects of our events;</li>
<li>analysing the use of our products and services;</li>
<li>using analytics to identify usage trends and determining the effectiveness of campaigns;</li>
<li>allowing you to comment on on our sites;</li>
<li>dealing with queries and complaints;</li>
<li>personalising your experience on our sites;</li>
<li>identifying fraudulent behaviour and ensuring our websites and systems are secure.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you object to our reliance on Legitimate Interests for any purpose please <a href="#1">contact our DPO</a>.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Who may we share your data with?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Agents</span><br />
We use third parties to perform certain functions on our behalf including fulfilling orders, sending emails, organising and managing events, running competitions and promotions, conducting surveys or polls, removing repetitive information from customer lists, comment hosting, website analysis, data analysis and processing credit card payments. They will have access to your personal information if necessary to perform their function but they cannot use it or disclose it for any other purpose, unless you have specifically given them consent to do so.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Aggregate information</span><br />
We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information, such as demographics and website usage statistics, with advertisers, sponsors and other organisations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Option to receive marketing information from associated third parties</span><br />

Only if you elect to receive such information, will we share your personal information with our associated third parties and they are only permitted by us to use it for the purpose of providing you with the marketing information you have requested. The use of your personal information by such third parties will be subject to their own privacy policy and practices. We are not responsible for the privacy policy or practices of any such third party. If you do not want to receive marketing information from associated companies you can notify us of this as part of the registration process. You can stop receiving this information at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions on the correspondence you receive, by amending your marketing preferences, or by emailing our DPO at DPO@futurenet.com giving your email address and details of the information you no longer wish to receive.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Products or services offered in partnership with third parties</span><br />
Certain products or services available through this website may be provided to you in partnership with a third party. That third party may require you to disclose personal information to them in order to receive such products or services. If you request a product or service offered in partnership with a third party, the identity of the third party will be disclosed to you and your personal information will be transferred to that third party. The use of your personal information by that third party is subject to its privacy policy and practices and we are not responsible for this.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Group Companies</span><br />
We only share your personal information with our group companies if you have elected to receive marketing information from them which may be of interest to you. They are only permitted by us to use it for the purpose of providing you with the marketing information you have requested. If you do not want to receive marketing information from our group companies you can notify us and you can stop receiving this information at any time by following the unsubscribe instructions on the correspondence you receive or by emailing our DPO at DPO@futurenet.com, giving your email address and details of the information you no longer wish to receive.</p>

We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely, including ensuring the location has been granted ‘adequacy status’ by the European Commission, or using our agreement with the supplier contains model contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, or ensuring the company we are transferring the data to is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield.</p>
<p id="7">We hold personal data for a variety of different purposes and the length of time we keep your data will vary depending on the services or products we are providing. We will only keep your data for a reasonable period of time, which is based on the purpose for which we are using your data. Once that purpose has been fulfilled, we will securely delete that data or anonymise your information (so that we, or anyone else, can no longer tell that data relates to you) unless we are required to retain the data longer for legal, tax or accounting reasons.</p>
<p id="8"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Security</strong></span></p>
<p>We are committed to protecting the personal data we hold. In accordance with GDPR, we adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures to help prevent unauthorised access to your information and ensure data is held securely. We also require any third parties to whom we may transfer personal data to have appropriate security measures in place. We ask third parties to complete Data Security Questionnaires so we can be sure they are a safe place for your data.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Protecting children’s privacy</strong></span></p>
<p id="9">Our products and services are for a general audience and not aimed at children. However, we recognise that some of our publications, for example in our Knowledge and Gaming portfolios, may appeal to a younger audience. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of sixteen or send any marketing communications to children. If we are running a competition which might be of interest to children, our competition rules specify that a parent or guardian must consent to entry. If, in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children in connection with our products and services, we will do so in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations including, without limitation, obtaining parental consent where necessary. The Internet offers children wonderful educational and entertainment resources. Your guidance and involvement are essential to help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience. We encourage you to visit <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/safetycenter/families/start/">https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/safetycenter/families/start/</a> for more information about keeping your family safe online. If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned that we may be processing personal data related to your child, please contact our <a href="#1">DPO</a>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Your rights</span></strong></p>
<p>You have the right to request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
<li>The correction of your personal data when incorrect, out of date or incomplete.</li>
<li>The erasure of your personal data.</li>
<li>That we stop using your personal data for direct marketing if you object to it.</li>
<li>That we stop any consent-based processing of your personal data after you withdraw that consent.</li>
<li>The right to request a transfer of your data to another service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your right to withdraw consent</span><br />
Whenever you have given us your consent to use your personal data, you have the right to change your mind at any time and withdraw that consent.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Where we rely on our legitimate interest</span><br />
In cases where we are processing your personal data on the basis of our legitimate interest, you can ask us to stop for reasons connected to your individual situation. We must then do so unless we believe we have a legitimate overriding reason to continue processing your personal data.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Direct marketing</span><br />
You have the right to stop the use of your personal data for direct marketing activity through all channels, or selected channels. We must always comply with your request. Remember, you can always stop direct marketing messages by clicking on an unsubscribe link in any of our emails or getting in touch with us.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Exercising your rights</span><br />
If you wish to exercise any of your rights please contact the Data Protection Officer:<br />
By post: Future Publishing Limited, Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA; or<br />
By email: DPO@futurenet.com.</p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). If you have authorised a third party to submit a request on your behalf, we will ask them to prove they have your permission to act. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request. We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. If this is case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p id="10"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">No fee usually required</span><br />
You will not usually have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the rights), however, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances. If we choose not to action your request we will explain to you the reasons for our refusal.</p>
<p id="11"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Information Commissioner’s Office</span><br />
If you feel you need to, you also have the right to make a complaint at any time to the ICO, the UK data protection supervisory authority (www.ico.org.uk).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Policy changes</strong></span></p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, so we encourage you to check it periodically. If we make material changes we will endeavour to provide you with appropriate notice before such changes take effect.</p>
