<p>We, and our affiliates, business partners, and third-party service providers may send &quot;cookies&quot; to your computer or use similar technologies to enhance your online experience at this Website. &quot;Cookies&quot; are a string of information that a website stores on a user's computer, and that the user's browser provides to the website each time the user submits a query to the website. Cookies can identify you as a unique customer and store your personal preferences as well as technical information (including click through and click stream data). Cookies manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through us or other networks or websites. Cookies can either be persistent - that is, they remain on your computer until you delete them - or temporary - that is, they last only until you close your browser.</p>
<p>When you login to this Website, we will record your user or member ID and the name associated with your user or member ID in the cookie file on your computer. We may also record your password in this cookie file, if you told us that you would like your password saved for automatic login. For security purposes, we encrypt account-related data that we store in these cookies. For services that do not require a user or member ID, the cookie will contain a unique identifier. We may use persistent tracking cookies on your mobile device, mainly for security protection purposes, such as to prevent phishers, scammers, unauthorized login attempts, and to help you access your hacked account. We may allow our service providers to serve cookies from this Website or application to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of this Website, its content, and advertising.</p>
<p>This Website may also use locally stored objects (sometimes referred to as &quot;Flash cookies&quot;) to provide certain content, such as video on demand, video clips, or animation. Adobe's Flash player and similar applications use this technology to remember settings, preferences, and usage similar to browser cookies. Flash cookies are not managed through your browser, but you can access your Flash management tools from Adobe's website.</p>
<p>We may also use &quot;Web beacons&quot; that monitor your use of this Website. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, or Web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users or to access cookies. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the user's device, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on the webpages (or in email) and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use Web beacons to collect the following information: (1) the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (2) the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the webpage on which the Web beacon appears; (3) the time the webpage containing the Web beacon was viewed; (4) the types of browser that fetched the Web beacon; and (5) the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. In addition, when corresponding with you through HTML capable email, Web beacons let us know whether you received and opened our email.</p>
<p>On their own, cookies or Web beacons do not contain or reveal any personally identifiable information. But if you choose to furnish personally identifiable information, this information can be linked to the data stored in the cookies or Web beacons.</p>
<p>Managing cookies and Web beacons. By accepting this privacy policy, you agree to our use of cookies and Web beacons as described in this privacy policy. You may adjust your browser to reject cookies from us or from any other website. Additionally, by setting your Web browser to display HTML emails as text only, you may be able to prevent the use of some Web beacons. Please consult the &quot;Help&quot; section of your browser for more information (for more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, or restrict the categories of cookies you wish to accept, you can consult the information at www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.) Please understand that certain areas of this Website can only be accessed in conjunction with cookies or similar devices and you should be aware that disabling cookies or similar devices might prevent you from accessing some of the content or Website features. You assume all responsibility for any resulting loss of functionality because of disabling cookies or similar devices.<br>
  5. How do you opt-out?</p>
<p>Marketing communications. We give you with an opportunity to express your preferences about receiving certain marketing communications from us or from unaffiliated third parties. If you decide in the future that you would like to update these preferences, you may (1) follow the &quot;unsubscribe&quot; instructions provided in any marketing email you receive from us or (2) send us an email at admin@yorkvillemarketing.net and we will edit your preferences accordingly. If you earlier chose to receive push notifications on your mobile device from us but no longer want to receive them, you can manage your preferences either through your device or app settings, depending on the type of device. Online opt-out requests are instant. However, we may continue to send you transactional emails, such as service announcements and administrative notices, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.</p>
<p>Mobile applications (if available). If you no longer want to have the application collect information, you may uninstall the application by using the standard uninstall processes available on your mobile device or through the mobile application marketplace or network. If you no longer want to receive tailored in-application advertisements, each operating system - Android for Android devices, iOS for Apple devices, and Windows for Microsoft devices - provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You should review the support materials or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator. Please note that the effect of opting out of targeted advertising (mobile or otherwise) will be to prevent targeted advertising, but not to prevent you from seeing all advertisements, and information may still be collected for other purposes (such as research, online services analytics, or internal operations).<br>
  6. Do you have any choices about what information you provide?</p>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of this Website because that information may be required: to register; purchase products or services; participate in a live interaction or promotion; ask a question; or initiate other transactions.<br>
  7. How secure is your personal information?</p>
<p>We take commercially reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personally identifiable information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network.</p>
<p>Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made 100% secure as recent cyber security breaches demonstrate. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personally identifiable information that we collect will never be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.<br>
  8. What about other websites linked to this Website?</p>
<p>Third parties are under no duty to comply with this privacy policy for personally identifiable information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We neither own nor control the third-party websites accessible through this Website. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to or gathered by third parties that operate them. We assume no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of any other websites that may provide links to this Website or to whom we may provide links, or for the privacy policies of any of their advertisers. Before visiting a third-party website, whether by means of a link on this Website or otherwise, and before providing any personally identifiable information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that website, and should take those steps necessary to, in your discretion, protect your privacy.<br>
  9. What is &quot;Do Not Track&quot; and does the Website follow it?</p>
<p>Do Not Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) is a privacy preference that you can set in your Web browser. DNT is a way for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out. However, we do not recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT.<br>
  10. Do California residents have special privacy rights?</p>
<p>If you are a California resident, you have the right to receive (1) information identifying any third-party company to whom we may have disclosed, within the past calendar year, personal information concerning you and your family for our direct marketing purposes; and (2) a description of the categories of personal information disclosed. If you want to exercise this right, you must make a request in writing to us to obtain this information. We will not process your request unless it includes your full name, email address, postal address, the URL for the website you visited, and the subject lined labeled &quot;Your California Privacy Rights.&quot; Please email your request to admin@yorkvillemarketing.net. We will only honor one request per calendar year.<br>
  11. Do Canadian citizens have special privacy rights?</p>
<p>The Website may be subject to Canadian law, specifically, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (S.C. 2000, c. 5). If you believe that we have violated your privacy rights in any way, please contact us immediately at admin@yorkvillemarketing.net. You may visit www.priv.gc.ca for more information about your privacy rights.<br>
  12. How do you update or correct your information?</p>
<p>To access the personally identifiable information that this Website collected about you, to correct factual errors in this information, or to update your information, please send an email to admin@yorkvillemarketing.net. To help protect your privacy and security, we will take commercially reasonable steps to help verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. If we have already given information to third parties as described in this privacy policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' privacy policies.<br>
  13. Can we change this privacy policy?</p>
<p>We may change this privacy policy, as we believe necessary or convenient to operate this Website. If we do make a change, we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to provide you with advance notice of any change by posting notice of the changed privacy policy on this Website at least 15 days before its effective date or by sending you an email message. Each version of this privacy policy will identify when we last updated it at the top of the webpage. We keep copies of earlier versions offline and we will send it to you on request. Unless we obtain your express consent, the changes will apply only to information collected after its last updated date, and not to information collected under earlier privacy policies. We encourage you to check this webpage frequently for any changes to this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the updated privacy policy, you must stop using this Website and delete any account you created with us. If you do not do this, we will consider your continued access to this Website as your acceptance of the updated privacy policy, and thus the updated privacy policy will govern your access to the Website after the last updated date.<br>
  14. What if you have more questions or want to contact us?</p>
<p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, our practices, or your dealings with us, please email us at admin@yorkvillemarketing.net. Please note that persons under 18-years old or the applicable age of majority may not access this Website. We do not collect any personal information from persons under 18-years old or the applicable age of majority.</p>
