Some mobile device IDs are persistent, while others may be resettable by accessing the device&rsquo;s privacy settings.

A log file is a file that records events that occur in connection with your use of the Service, such as your service use data.</li><li><strong>Cookies</strong>. A cookie is a small data file stored on your device that acts as a unique tag to identify your browser. We use several types of cookies including session cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies help with personalizing your experience, remembering your preferences, and supporting security features. Additionally, persistent cookies allow us to bring you advertising both on and off the Service. Persistent cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time, and generally may be controlled through your browser settings.</li><li><strong>Pixels</strong>. A pixel (also known as a web beacon) is code embedded in a website, video, e-mail, or advertisements that sends information about your use to a server. There are various types of pixels, including image pixels (which are small graphic images) and JavaScript pixels (which contains JavaScript code). When you access a website, video, e-mail, or advertisement that contains a pixel, the pixel may permit us or a third party to drop or read cookies on your browser.

These tracking technologies are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. For example, our apps may include third party SDKs, which is code that sends information about your use to a server, and is in effect the app version of a pixel. These SDKs allow us to track our conversions and communicate with you across devices, bring you advertising both on and off the Service, customize the app to your interests and preferences and link such across platforms and devices, and provide you with additional functionality, such as the ability to connect our Service with your social media account.</li><li><strong>Location-Identifying Technologies</strong>. GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and other location-aware technologies may be used to collect precise location data when you enable location-based services through your device. Location data may be used for purposes such as verifying your device&rsquo;s location and delivering or restricting relevant content and advertising based on that location.</li><li><strong>Voice Processing Technologies</strong>.
