<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Greenmangaming.com and playfire.com use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’). Our cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website.</p>

<p>Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier - if a website doesn’t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site. For example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won’t recognise you and it won’t be able to keep you logged in. Greenmangaming.com and playfire.com also use cookies to enable Us to target advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.

<h3>What is in a cookie?</h3>

<h3>What to do if you don’t want cookies to be set</h3>

Although this is generally quite harmless you may not, for example, want to see advertising that has been targeted to your interests. If you prefer, it is possible to block some or all cookies, or even to delete cookies that have already been set; but you need to be aware that you might lose some functions of the website.</p>

<h3>No Cookies please!</h3>
