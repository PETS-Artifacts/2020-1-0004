		&#39;TV Licensing&#39; is a trade mark of the BBC and is used under licence by companies contracted by the BBC to administer the collection of the television licence fee and enforcement of the television licensing system. We (the BBC) are a public authority in respect of our television licensing functions and we retain overall responsibility. We are also the data controller of personal data processed by TV Licensing.</p>
	<p>
		We are committed to safeguarding personal information that you provide to us. This commitment extends to our TV Licensing contractors and subcontractors. Whenever you or someone acting on your behalf provide us with your personal information, we are legally obliged to use it in line with all laws concerning the protection of such information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the &quot;data protection laws&quot;). The BBC is the data controller under the Data Protection Act 1998 in respect of our TV Licensing functions.</p>

		<span>4. TV Licensing and cookies</span></h3>
	<p>
		Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to &lsquo;remember&rsquo; you, either for the duration of your visit (using a &lsquo;session cookie&rsquo;) or for repeat visits (using a &lsquo;persistent cookie&rsquo;).</p>
	<p>
		Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier. Some are used to assess and improve the performance of a website based on how people are using it. Others are necessary to ensure you can transact or log in, for instance. If a website doesn&rsquo;t use cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site &ndash; for example, when you enter your login details and move to another page it won&rsquo;t recognise you and it won&rsquo;t be able to keep you logged in.</p>
	<p>
		Some websites will also use cookies to enable them to target their advertising or marketing messages based for example, on your location and/or browsing habits.</p>
	<p>
		Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (&lsquo;first party cookies&rsquo;) or they may be set by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (&lsquo;third party cookies&rsquo;). You can learn more about the <a href="#4.5">different types of cookies in Section 4.5</a>.</p>
	<h4 id="4.1" style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 118%; margin-bottom: 0em">
		4.1. What is in a cookie?</h4>
	<p>
		A cookie is a simple text file that is stored on your computer or mobile device by a website&rsquo;s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Each website can send its own cookie to your device. Each cookie is unique to your web browser and will contain some anonymous information such as a unique cookie id, the site you are browsing and a uniquely generated number that allows a website to remember your preferences or what&rsquo;s in your shopping basket, for example.</p>
	<h4 id="4.2" style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 118%; margin-bottom: 0em">
		4.2. Can I browse the TV Licensing website without receiving any cookies?</h4>
	<p>
		Depending on the web-browser that you use to access our website, you may have the ability to accept or decline cookies locally within your browser. Options include accepting all cookies automatically, notifying you when a cookie is downloaded, or not receiving cookies at any time. These options may be found in the &lsquo;preferences&rsquo; section of your web browser. Each browser is different, so check the &quot;Help&quot; menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences. You may find the <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org">www.aboutcookies.org</a> website useful for information on how to change cookie settings in a range of commonly used browsers. If you set your computer to reject cookies, you can still browse www.tvlicensing.co.uk. However, certain functions will not be available to you including paying for your TV Licence and updating your details.</p>

		4.5. Types of cookies</h4>
	<h5 id="4.5.1">
		4.5.1. First Party Cookies</h5>
	<p>
		First party cookies are set by the website, or domain, you are visiting (e.g. www.tvlicensing.co.uk) and only that website can retrieve the information stored in those cookies. You can tell if a cookie is a first party cookie if the host domain for a cookie is the same as the one in the browser. <a href="#4.8">Find out how to view cookies in your browser</a>.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.2">
		4.5.2. Third Party Cookies</h5>
	<p>
		Third party cookies are set by an organisation other than TV Licensing. For example, TV Licensing uses a number of suppliers who set cookies on TV Licensing&rsquo;s behalf in order to deliver the services that they are providing (e.g. reporting on visit volumes to a particular webpage). These will be third party cookies.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.2.1">
		4.5.2.1 How do third party organisations which display TV Licensing online communications use cookies?</h5>
	<p>
		We use a range of channels (including television, radio and online) in order to raise awareness, explain the law relating to TV Licensing, provide information about ways to pay and deter evaders.</p>
	<p>
		Where online communications are used (for example, banners displayed on other websites by third parties acting on behalf of TV Licensing), a cookie will be sent to your browser from the other website and stored on your computer. These cookies are used for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails.&nbsp; We will ensure that cookies set by third parties on behalf of TV Licensing comply with the TV Licensing Privacy Policy and we will not collect personal data during this process. <a href="#4.6">Find out more in section 4.6 How does TV Licensing use cookies?</a></p>
	<p>
		It is the responsibility of third party websites themselves to provide information about non-TV Licensing cookies that may be served from their site. We therefore recommend that you check the cookies policy of any external sites if you would like to know more about their use of cookies. If the host domain for a cookie is different to the one in the browser bar when it was downloaded, then it is a third party cookie.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.3">
		4.5.3. Session Cookies</h5>
	<p>
		Session Cookies are stored only temporarily during a browsing session and are deleted from your device when the browser is closed.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.4">
		4.5.4. Persistent Cookies</h5>
	<p>
		This type of cookie is saved on your computer for a fixed period (usually a year or longer) and is not deleted when the browser is closed. Persistent cookies are used where we need to identify your computer or device for more than one browsing session. For example, we use this type of cookie to count the number and frequency of repeat visits to the TV Licensing website.</p>
	<p>
		Persistent cookies can also be used if we need to know who you are so that we can store your preferences and remember them for the next visit. TV Licensing does not currently use persistent cookies in this way.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.5">
		4.5.5. Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs</h5>
	<p>
		These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many sites in order to help them to understand and analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of the site.</p>
	<p>
		A web beacon usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when the page or email was viewed, from what device and which geographic location.</p>
	<p>
		TV Licensing uses web beacons in emails to tell us if the email has been opened.</p>
	<h5 id="4.5.6">
		4.5.6. Opting out of web beacons</h5>
	<p>
		As a web beacon forms part of a web page, it is not possible to &lsquo;opt-out&rsquo; as such but you can render some of them ineffective by not downloading images in your email.</p>
	<p>

We use cookies that are <strong>strictly necessary</strong> to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain features you have requested, for instance to pay for your TV Licence or update your details. We also use cookies to help us to measure and improve the <strong>performance</strong> of our website to provide you with a better user experience and measure the effectiveness of our online communications, letters and emails.</p>

Information supplied by cookies helps us to understand how our visitors use the TV Licensing website so that we can improve how we present our content to you.&nbsp;They allow us to test different design ideas for particular pages, such as the TV Licensing home page. We also use data collected by cookies for analytical purposes in order to monitor the interaction between, and effectiveness of, our online communications, letters and emails.

		5.2. Will we share your personal information with anyone else?</h4>

		We will never sell your data to anyone. Any information you provide will only be used by us and our service providers for the purposes of administering TV Licensing. TV Licensing sometimes uses other companies to provide services that require them to process your personal information e.g. to append additional information, for example whether there has been a change of occupancy at an address. When this happens such companies are contractually required to follow our instructions, including keeping your data secure, and complying with the Data Protection Act 1998 where relevant. Similarly we may collect information from other parts of the BBC. Your data would still only be used for the purposes of collecting and enforcing the licence fee.</p>

We use strict procedures and security features to prevent any unauthorised access to, or misuse or loss of, your personal information.</p>

				<li>
					If you purchased your licence via the TV Licensing website at www.tvlicensing.co.uk you are required to provide a valid email address. We may then email you other messages regarding your TV Licence including reminders that your licence is about to expire. If you would prefer to receive these messages by post rather than email you can <a href="#5.5">change your communication preferences via one of the methods described in section 5.5</a>.</li>
				<li>
					If you did not purchase your licence via the TV Licensing website, you can change the way you receive messages from TV Licensing (including choosing to receive messages via email) by&nbsp;<a href="/cs/update/your-licence/index.app">updating your details</a> or by contacting us by phone, email or post.</li>
				<li>
					If you provide your email address to us when writing to us, we will take this as an indication that you are happy for us to send you email communications relating to TV Licensing. You can unsubscribe at any time as explained in section 5.5.
					<p>
						If you choose to provide us with an email address, it is your responsibility to ensure that it is valid and to notify TV Licensing of any changes. You can <a href="/cs/update/your-licence/index.app">change your email address online</a> or via phone or post.</p>

		5.4.2. Text Messages</h5>
	<p>
		If you provide us with your mobile phone number, we will only use it to contact you via text message if we have your consent to do so.</p>
	<p>
		You may also receive texts if you pay for your TV Licence by cash instalments, which means you can pay via SMS at your convenience, as we have your card details securely stored and encrypted.</p>
	<h4 id="5.5" style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 118%; margin-bottom: 0em">
		5.5. How do I stop receiving emails and/or text messages?</h4>
	<p>
		There are a number of ways in which you can stop (i.e. unsubscribe from) receiving emails and/or text messages from TV Licensing (refer to <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>-<a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>.). When you unsubscribe from either text message and/or email communications, we will record your decision and will not use your email address or mobile phone number for such messages unless you decide to subscribe to such communications again (refer to <a href="#5.6">5.6</a>).</p>
	<p>
		You can unsubscribe from email contact at any point (refer to <a href="#5.5.3">5.5.3</a>). However, if you do so less than a month before your current TV Licence expires the changes may not come into effect in time to receive a renewal reminder by post so you may still receive your reminder by email while our systems are being updated.</p>
	<p>
		Market Research emails that you have consented to receive can be stopped by unsubscribing to them.</p>
	<h5 id="5.5.1">
		5.5.1. Unsubscribe via the TV Licensing website</h5>
	<p>

		5.5.2. Unsubscribe via phone or post</h5>
	<p>
		You can <a href="/cs/update/your-licence/index.app">unsubscribe from receiving emails and/or text messages</a> by contacting us either by post at TV Licensing, Darlington, DL98 1TL, or by phoning us on 0300 790 6131.</p>
	<h5 id="5.5.3">
		5.5.3. Unsubscribe via the instructions contained in the emails / texts themselves.</h5>
	<p>
		You may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions included within any email or text message that we send to you. Please note that a minority of texts and emails (e.g. receipts for electronic payment) will not contain unsubscribe instructions. If the text or email you receive does not contain an unsubscribe link, you are still able to unsubscribe by using the methods set out at <a href="#5.5.1">5.5.1</a>-<a href="#5.5.2">5.5.2</a>.</p>
	<h4 id="5.6" style="margin-top: 0.5em; font-size: 118%; margin-bottom: 0em">
		5.6. How do I start receiving emails and/or text messages if I&rsquo;ve previously asked for those messages to be stopped?</h4>

		Under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">Data Protection Act 1998</a> you have the right to request copies of the personal information we hold about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. This is known as a subject access request or SAR. The process for making a SAR is to complete the relevant application form and provide two pieces of approved identification together with payment for a &pound;10 fee.</p>
	<p>

		9.1. Links to other websites</h4>
	<p>
		The TV Licensing website may contain links and references to other websites. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites and we encourage you to read the Privacy Policy of the other websites you visit.</p>

		9.2. Internet Protocol Addresses</h4>
	<p>
		Technical information is gathered about you without you actively providing it through the use of Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), so you can access the Internet. In most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing from time to time as you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user&#39;s computer). We log the IP address of any user visiting the website, but this data is not used to develop a personal profile of you.</p>
