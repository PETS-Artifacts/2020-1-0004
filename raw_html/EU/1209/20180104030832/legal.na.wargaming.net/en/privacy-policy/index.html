This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor. Please also note that when using a video game you should take certain standard health and safety precautions, including avoiding playing the game when tired and not had much sleep, taking 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour, sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, and playing the game in a well-lit environment.</p> <h2>10.

The following list is only a summary, but it gives some idea of names, images, signatures, avatars and clan logos which are not accepted with the Game environment:</p> <p>Names, Avatars, Images/Video, Signatures &amp; Clan logos ...</p> <p>3.01 that contain profanity, including its abbreviated form.</p> <p>3.02 that contain insults, personal attacks, abuse or harassment.</p> <p>3.03 that contain unprintable words or abbreviations, or which are unattractive and/or unreadable.</p> <p>3.04 which either in whole or partly contain copyrighted or registered trade mark elements.</p> <p>3.05 which have (in any way) racist or nationalistic implications which may create offense to a certain nation, ethnic, religious or racial group.</p> <p>3.06 that contain an allusion of racial or national supremacy, as well as discriminative propaganda on any level.</p> <p>3.07 which contain insults or derogatory comments based on race, nationality, religion, culture, mental stature, sex, or sexual preference.</p> <p>3.08 which have an association with sexuality, pedophilia, sexual abuse; or have an offensive connection to the human body or bodily functions.</p> <p>3.09 which contain nudity, sexually explicit material or content that is otherwise deemed inappropriate.</p> <p>3.10 which contain excessive gore or violence, or are obscene/vulgar.</p> <p>3.11 which make reference to addictive or illegal substances or their use, or any other illegal activities.</p> <p>3.12 that contain Logotypes, symbols, emblems or figures connected in one way or another with organizations, that violate or were violating existing laws and rules; i.e. anything that may provoke strong negative reaction/association or promote national/ethnic/religious hatred. (For example, using different variations of Nazi symbolic, abridgments and signs [88, 14, 420, SS], or similar stylizing [such as, 55] as well as credentials, names and surnames of Nazi leaders.)</p> <p>3.13 that contain reference to current mainstream religions that may create offense, i.e. names such as God, Jesus, Allah, etc.</p> <p>3.14 that are connected with negative historical or political personalities, first of all those who are judged by international courts for crimes against humanity, those that generally arouse feelings of suffering or disgust in the majority of people, as well as members of currently existing terrorist organizations.</p> <p>3.15 that negatively portrays the projects staff, or administration.</p> <p>3.16 which in any other manner violates the End User License Agreement or local laws, either implicitly or explicitly are prohibited (This also contains links to websites containing the above).</p> <p>If names (player or clan), avatars, signatures, images/video, clan logos within the forums or within the game violate these rules the offending account may be changed and/or the accounts may be sanctioned or suspended.

Inappropriate conduct in game / Fair play principles</h3> <p>The following actions are prohibited in game:</p> <p>4.01. Intentionally damaging vehicles belonging to a player on the same team (team damage).</p> <p>4.02. Intentionally destroying vehicles belonging to a player on the same team (team kill).</p> <p>4.03. Intentionally blocking (blocking from front and rear) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.</p> <p>4.04. Intentionally propping (blocking on one side, where the other side of a user's vehicle touches a fixed indestructible obstacle, preventing free movement.) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.</p> <p>4.05. Intentionally informing participants of the opposing team through battle, or voice chat, the location of vehicles belonging to players of the same team.</p> <p>4.06. Intentionally exploiting the physics system to damage an allied tank, plane, ship or similar actions. This includes, but is not limited to, pushing an allied tank into line of fire, pushing allied tanks off of cliffs, bridges, into water, etc.</p> <p>4.07. Using bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player within the battle (excessive and repetitive passive play).</p> <h3>5. Rules Enforcement </h3> <p>The "Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who massively cause damage to vehicles of their own team (team damage), or intentionally destroy vehicles of their teammates (team kill).</p> <p><strong>Please note that the Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System is not available in certain Games, for instance, World of Tanks Blitz, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. In such cases, please contact us through </strong><a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a>.</p> <p>5.01. Based on combat logs for a particular period of time, usually several days, the automated system finds players involved in friendly fire and team kill incidents. The calculations are quite complicated and the main factor that is taken into account is damage inflicted to allies to total damage ratio.</p> <p>5.02. If the above ratio for a particular user exceeds a certain fixed threshold value, the system identifies the user as a violator, since his main target is doing damage to allied vehicles.</p> <p>5.03. If the damage ratio for such user exceeds the verifying coefficient, introduced in order to make distinction between intentional and accidental team killers, such user is identified as an offender and goes onto the suspension list.</p> <p>5.04. While calculating damage to allies / total damage ratio only the battles with team kill/damage incidents are taken into account.</p> <p>5.05. In connection with the introduction of Automated Anti-TK Reporting System), listed below are set uniform measures that can be taken against offenders:*. First detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager leads to 1 hour game account suspension.*. Second detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager (recidivism) leads to 1 day game account suspension.*. Multiple detections of a user as a team killer and team-damager (systemic recidivism) will resort in escalating suspensions leading to a PERMANENT game account suspension.</p> <p>The "Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who use automated bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player.</p> <p>5.06. In the case of detection of single or short-term signs of use of automated scripts (bot software) in user's logs, user's account is taken under thorough control by the administration. The owner of the account can be informed by special notifications sent to the registered e-mail.</p> <p>5.07. In case of detection of signs of massive or overt use of automated scripts or botting software in user's logs, the user's account is suspended permanently, with a possibility of suspension being lifted in the future, after the administration conducts a complete rollback of vehicles, achievements, funds (credits) and research except premium tanks, premium consumables, premium shells and gold.</p> <p>5.08. Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System is not meant to substitute the Technical Support service, the system aims at making their work easier. The most difficult cases thereby will be solved individually via Technical Support service.</p> <h3>6. Reporting in-game violations</h3> <p>In certain Games you will be able to use the Automated Anti-TK Reporting System. In this case, an automated system of violations tracking (team damage, team kill) will operate and the administration draws your attention to the following information - with the introduction of this system, users' complaints about the above mentioned violations will not be considered. From now on all punishments for team damage and team kill incidents will be executed <strong>automatically without support service workers' interference</strong>. The system has been customized, tested multiple times and currently works correctly. We also draw your attention to the fact that a multitude of all possible circumstances accompanying different violations (including extenuating and aggravating ones) has been taken into consideration. All requests relating to ban cancellation or minimizing the punishment period, laid by the system, <strong>will be ignored</strong>. Additional information on the automated system of team killers and bot users tracking you will find on this page:</p> <p><a href="http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/topic/152218-friendly-fire-team-kill-auto-system/">Automated Anti-TK Reporting System</a></p> <h3>7. Official Language</h3> <p>7.01. General chat: The preferred language of the In Game Garage Chat &amp; Company lobby (or General Chat in World of Tanks Blitz) is any of our supported languages (English, Spanish, and Portuguese). Players who wish to communicate in their native language are urged to do so in channels created specifically for their language. </p> <p>7.02. In Game Battles and other In Game Chats: The preferred language is English, however non-English is allowed. Please be patient with players whose first language may not be your own.</p> <p>Please note that chat channels are not available in World of Tanks Blitz. </p> <h3>8. Important/Miscellaneous</h3> <p>8.01. Repeated violations any area of these Rules or the EULA, including the areas detailed above, will often result in permanent suspension from the game and/or forums.</p> <p>8.02. This policy is not language-restrictive. Language that falls under this policy will always be subject to the repercussions listed, whether it is inappropriate in English or any other language.</p> <p>8.03. Players may provide feedback or address any concerns to: Technical Support service (forum and game suspension appeals), website: <a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a>.</p></div>

Unless and to the extent that we have expressly authorised you in writing, you must not:</p> <ul> <li>(a) copy or download any Content from a Service (except as part of the proper use or operation of that Service);</li> <li>(b) distribute, publicly perform or display, lease, sell, transmit, transfer, publish, edit, copy, create derivative works from, rent, sub-license, distribute, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer or otherwise make unauthorized use of Content;</li> <li>(c) make any commercial use (i.e. for profit) of the Content; or</li> <li>(d) remove, obscure, or alter copyright, patent, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to Content.</li> </ul> <p>7.4 Wargaming makes the Content available to you subject to the following conditions:</p> <ul> <li>(a) we can only make Content available to you if it is legal for you to have access to that Content in your home country;</li> <li>(b) you may only obtain Content from us (or from any person or third party that we authorise for this purpose) and you must not obtain Content from any other person or attempt to do so;</li> <li>(c) we reserve the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Content, and we also reserve the right to limit or block any request to acquire or obtain Content for any reason;</li> <li>(d) WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE AVAILABLE AT <strong>ALL</strong> TIMES, IN <strong>ALL</strong> COUNTRIES AND/OR <strong>ALL</strong> GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, OR AT <strong>ANY</strong> GIVEN TIME OR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER PARTICULAR CONTENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH OF TIME (UNLESS WE EXPRESSLY SAY OTHERWISE AS PART OF THE SERVICES);</li> <li>(e) once you have redeemed or activated Content, including without limitation any Virtual Good, it is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content or for cash, or other goods or services; and</li> <li>(f) we may change, replace, remove access to or update the Content at any time in our sole discretion.</li> </ul> <h2>8. Virtual Goods</h2> <p>8.1 Virtual Goods. The Services may permit you to acquire and accumulate certain virtual goods as made available by Wargaming ("<strong>Virtual Goods</strong>"). Virtual Goods constitute a limited, non-transferable, revocable right to use features of the Services when, as, and if allowed by Wargaming and solely as governed by and permitted under these Terms of Service. Subject to these Terms of Service, Virtual Goods may be exchanged for access to upgraded features, may be exchanged for other Virtual Goods, or used in connection with other features made available by Wargaming through the Services. Virtual Goods are not real-world currency, have no monetary value, and cannot be used, exchanged, or redeemed except as provided in these Terms of Service, and cannot be transferred, in any case. For avoidance of doubt, Virtual Goods are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Wargaming or any third party at any time; provided, however, if and to the extent that any Virtual Goods are determined by applicable law to constitute real world currency or property, then they are the property of Wargaming.</p> <p>8.2 Acquiring Virtual Goods. You may accrue Virtual Goods in a variety of ways. Wargaming may distribute Virtual Goods in exchange for taking certain actions (either directly within the Services, or in connection with a third party service), for a fee, or without any fee or required action, in its sole discretion. Wargaming may charge fees for the right to exercise rights associated with Virtual Goods. You agree that you do not "own" the Virtual Goods and that Wargaming has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Virtual Goods in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Wargaming will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. Wargaming allows you to accumulate and manage your Virtual Goods, and may use terms such as "buy" and "sell" to refer to the grant or transfer of rights to use the Services. Use of terms such as "buy" or "sell" does not indicate any ownership right. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase. If your payment is in a currency other than that of the purchase amount shown on the website, the exchange rate applied on the payment date will depend on the selected payment method.</p> <p>8.3 Additional Terms and Conditions. Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules apply to Virtual Goods:</p> <ul> <li>(a) Virtual Goods may only be redeemed for other Virtual Goods where permitted in the Services;</li> <li>(b) once you have purchased Virtual Goods, those Virtual Goods are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them);</li> <li>(c) Virtual Goods cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Virtual Goods for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game;</li> <li>(d) Virtual Goods cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Virtual Goods as permitted in the Services);</li> <li>(e) to acquire Virtual Goods, you need to follow the instructions provided in the Services; this can include making a payment and providing personal and financial details (which you represent shall be complete and accurate).</li> <li>(f) the price payable for the Virtual Goods (including any value added tax or other applicable taxes of duties) will be as set out on our Sites or as part of the Services (as applicable), but we reserve the right to change the price of Virtual Goods at any time at our discretion;</li> <li>(g) we do not make any promises about how or when Virtual Goods may be available and can update or change Virtual Goods at any time;</li> <li>(h) you may only acquire Virtual Goods from us (or from any person that we authorise for this purpose), or from another authorized user of a Game through the use of a feature included in the Game by Wargaming expressly for such purpose (such as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game), and you must not obtain Virtual Goods from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and</li> <li>(i) we may limit or block a request to acquire Virtual Goods for any reason.</li> </ul> <p>8.4 Non-Refundable Purchase. In the event you purchase Virtual Goods from Wargaming, we will transfer the Virtual Goods to you only once that payment has been processed, and you may start using Virtual Goods as soon as you have completed the purchase process. You therefore have no right to cancel any transaction to purchase Virtual Goods after completion of the purchase process and being entitled to download the Virtual Goods.</p> <p>8.5 Restrictions. You agree and acknowledge that Wargaming may deny or place limitations or restrictions on any purchase, issue, or redemption of Virtual Goods, individually or with respect to general volume, at any time and for any reason. Wargaming may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Virtual Goods transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of other laws or regulations, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with the Services, or the service of any affiliated or related third party.</p> <p>8.6 Gifts. The following rules apply in regard to the gifts made through the Premium Shop:</p> <ul> <li>(a) <strong>As of the latest ToS update, gifts are only available in World of Tanks and World of Warplanes.

To receive a gift, the recipient must go to the My Gifts page in the Premium Shop and accept the gift.</li> <li>(d) A recipient may accept or decline a gift. A recipient has 30 days to accept a gift. If it is not accepted within this period, the sender will automatically receive compensation to their account as in-game currency equal to the price of the gift as at the time of purchase.</li> <li>(e) Within 24 hours after a recipient accepts or declines a gift, the sender will receive a notification via email.</li> <li>(f) If a recipient of a gift already owns a vehicle included in the gift, that vehicle's full cost in gold as at the time of purchase in the Premium Shop will be automatically compensated to the recipient. The vehicle will not be transferred to the recipient's account.</li> <li>(g) Any vehicles sent as a gift will be transferred together with a corresponding Garage Slot.</li> <li>(h) <strong>If the sender of a gift cancels the payment or fails to pay after the recipient accepts the gift, both accounts will be blocked until the circumstances are clarified. Please do not accept gifts from unknown senders.</strong></li> </ul> <h2>9. Fan Websites</h2> <p>9.1 This section relates to any fan web site that you may create or operate regarding any of our Games or Services (collectively, "<strong>Fansites,</strong>" and each a "<strong>Fansite</strong>").</p> <p>9.2 At some of our Sites we expressly designate certain Content, such as Wargaming game-related images, graphics or artwork and trade marks, as being "<strong>for fansite use</strong>" (for example see: http:///worldoftanks.eu/news/943-world-tanks-fankit). In these Terms of Service we refer to this specifically designated Content as "<strong>Fansite Content</strong>".</p> <p>9.3 Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Wargaming grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, personal, non-transferable and limited license to reproduce and display Fansite Content on Fansites owned and operated by you and solely for non-commercial purposes. This license is further conditional upon you complying with the following provisions:</p> <ul> <li>(a) you acknowledge and agree that Wargaming retains ownership of the Fansite Content, and any and all derivative works thereof, and has the right to amend, delete, add to or otherwise modify, or to revoke the foregoing license with respect to, any items of Fansite Content at any time;</li> <li>(b) you agree to include Wargaming's trade mark, copyright or other proprietary rights notices when displaying Fansite Content if we request you to do so and in the manner that we request you to do so;</li> <li>(c) you agree to comply with any usage guidelines that we may provide to you from time to time;</li> <li>(d) you shall not remove or alter any identifying information or copyright management information conveyed in connection with copies of Fansite Content, including in digital form, nor challenge Wargaming's ownership (or the ownership of any third party) of the Fansite Content;</li> <li>(e) you shall not use or adopt any trademarks that might be confusingly similar to any Fansite Content;</li> <li>(f) the Fansite will not post material that is disparaging, illegal or infringes on the rights of any third party or that damages (or that might damage) the reputation of Wargaming or of any of the Games;</li> <li>(g) except as expressly permitted in these Terms of Service, you shall not rent, lease, reproduce, modify, translate the Fansite Content, or make an adaptation of (including without limitation fiction or visual art), or in any way exploit, any of the Content without our express written permission; and</li> <li>(h) you must not make, or seek to make, any commercial use or profit out of the Fansite Content (including for example by selling subscriptions to your Fansite) without our prior written consent.</li> </ul> <p>9.4 If you fail to comply with any of the terms set out in this section, we reserve the right to terminate your license over the Fansite Content and also to close your Account.</p> <p>9.5 All goodwill arising from your use of Fansite Content, including from use of any trademarks owned by Wargaming, shall insure solely to the benefit of Wargaming.</p> <h2>10. User Generated Content</h2> <p>10.1 General. Some Services permit you to create or upload content which you own, have created or otherwise have appropriate rights in (which we refer to in these Terms of Service as "<strong>User Generated Content</strong>" or "<strong>UGC</strong>"). UGC includes, for example: Account personas, forum posts, chat posts, voice chat, messenger type features, profile content and any other content or materials contributed by users to, on, or through the Services. If Wargaming believes that your use or uploading of UGC breaches any of the terms and conditions set forth herein, then Wargaming may remove, block, edit, move or disable such UGC in its sole discretion. If you contravene any of the terms and conditions herein, Wargaming reserves the right to suspend or permanently remove availability of your UGC and to take any other steps which we consider appropriate.</p> <p>10.2 License Grant to Wargaming.

Feedback and User Submissions</h2> <p>11.1 We are always pleased to hear from our users and welcome specific comments about our Services. Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we have specifically requested. The aim of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects that we develop might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information such as game ideas or original artwork ("<strong>Submissions</strong>").</p> <p>11.2 Any and all Submissions that you send to us, whether at our specific request or notwithstanding our request that you do not do so, shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property from the time of uploading or transmission.</p> <p>11.3 Accordingly, you hereby assign to Wargaming (including as a present assignment of future rights) all intellectual property rights in Submissions that you send to us to the extent owned by you. If for any reason this assignment is not effective, then you agree that Wargaming shall have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license to do any of the acts restricted by the copyright in these Submissions and to use and exploit any other intellectual property rights in these Submissions and to authorise others to do so, throughout the world for any purpose and in any way whatsoever. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you also waive any moral rights or rights of a like nature that you may have in such Submissions.</p> <h2>12.

Suspension and Termination of Use, Account or Services</h2> <p>13.1 If you violate any provision of these Terms of Service or the EULA,, then we may, at our sole discretion depending on the seriousness of the breach and without any notice to you, take some or all of the following actions:</p> <ol> <li>suspend your Account for a short period of time;</li> <li>suspend your Account for a longer period of time; and</li> <li>may close your Account, and</li> </ol> <p>in each case the level of seriousness of the breach shall be determined exclusively by Wargaming and you agree not to appeal against such Wargaming decisions.</p> <p>If we suspend your Account, then during the period of that suspension you will not be able to access your Account or use any of the Services. If we close your Account, then you will never be able to access your Account and we may also prohibit you from accessing or using the Services in future.</p> <p>We will only close your Account in very serious circumstances where we consider that a suspension is not sufficient. For example, this might include a very serious contravention of these Terms of Service, the Forum Rules, a EULA, or the Privacy Policy, rules of third party platforms or where you have contravened the abovementioned rules or any of them on numerous occasions.</p> <p>We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue any or all of the Services at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Services) without notice to you.

Updates and Interruptions to the Services</h2> <p>14.1 From time to time we may need to update, reset, temporarily interrupt or shut down some or all of the Services. Any of these actions may cause you to lose access to the Services temporarily and/or cause you setbacks within a Game or other aspects of your use of the Services. Please bear in mind that these activities are sometimes required to enable us to continue to provide the Services.</p> <p>14.2 We shall have no liability to you if the Services or any aspect of them (including any Virtual Goods, accounts, statistics, user ranks or profile information) are interrupted or unavailable for any reason.</p> <h2>15. Links to Third Party Sites</h2> <p>The Services may include hyperlinks to web sites operated by third parties including advertisers and other content providers.

Beta Tests</h2> <p>16.1 We may give you the opportunity to beta test new games and features of the Sites. Your participation as a beta tester is subject to the following terms and conditions.</p> <p>16.2 Unless expressly indicated otherwise, all beta tests are confidential. The beta games, including information about features and functionality to be offered as part of the games, are confidential. If you participate in a beta test, you must safeguard and prevent unauthorised access to, copying, disclosure, and unauthorised use of the beta games. You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to beta games to any other person. Your obligation to keep the beta games confidential will continue until we publicly distribute, or otherwise disclose to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.</p> <p>16.3 If Wargaming notifies you that you have been selected as a beta tester for an applicable beta game, you are invited to play the beta game for the sole purpose of evaluating the beta game and identifying errors. Nothing in these Terms of Service or the Sites shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the beta games. THE BETA GAMES ARE PROVIDED FOR TESTING ON AN "AS IS" BASIS AND WE MAKE NO WARRANTY TO YOU OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p> <p>16.4 When playing certain beta games, you may accumulate or have access to Virtual Goods or other features referred to as treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators. We may reset this data when the relevant game completes this testing phase or at any time during the testing process. In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.</p> <p>16.5 By starting a beta game, you agree that:</p> <ul> <li>(a) playing beta games is at your own risk and that you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs;</li> <li>(b) any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time;</li> <li>(c) we have no obligation to make these games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all;</li> <li>(d) these games may be available only by subscription once the testing process is complete or at any time in the future;</li> <li>(e) these Terms of Service apply to your use of the games during the testing phase; and</li> <li>(f) unless otherwise expressly indicated by Wargaming, you will keep all information about the beta games confidential and not disclose such information to any other person.</li> </ul> <h2>17. Epilepsy Warning</h2> <p>Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain monitor images or playing certain video games. This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor. Please also note that when using a video game you should take certain standard health and safety precautions, including avoiding playing the game when tired and not had much sleep, taking 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour, sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, and playing the game in a well-lit environment.</p> <h2>18. Indemnity. </h2> <p>You agree that you are responsible for your use of the Services, and you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Wargaming and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, consultants, and agents (collectively, the "Wargaming Entities") from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with (i) your access to, use of, or alleged use of the Services; (ii) your violation of these Terms of Service or any representation, warranty, or agreements referenced herein, or any applicable law or regulation; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property or privacy right; or (iv) any disputes or issues between you and any third party. We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you (and without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to such matter), and in such case, you agree to cooperate with our defense of such claim.</p> <h2>19. Disclaimers; No Warranties</h2> <p>EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN AN APPLICABLE END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT, THE SERVICES, GAMES, ANCILLARY SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THE SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.</p> <p>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE SERVICES AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE SERVICES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT.</p> <h2>20. Limitation of Liability</h2> <p>20.1 IN NO EVENT WILL THE WARGAMING ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICES OR ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT THE WARGAMING ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p> <p>20.2 YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE WARGAMING ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE (INCLUDING ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE) OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (i) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO WARGAMING IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SPECIFIC SERVICE OR GAME FROM WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE OR (ii) $100.</p> <p>20.3 SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p> <p>20.4 EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS OF SERVICE THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.</p> <h2>21. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2> <p>These Terms of Service and any dispute, claim or obligation (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Wargaming agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Alameda County, California, USA for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.</p> <h2>22. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2> <p>22.1 Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Wargaming in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Wargaming agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms of Service shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong></p> <p>22.2 Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 22.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p> <p>22.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Wargaming.</p> <p>22.4 Notice; Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). Wargaming's address for Notice is: Wargaming PCL, 105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Wargaming may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Wargaming shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Wargaming in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.</p> <p>22.5 Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, Wargaming will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Wargaming for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p> <p>22.6 No Class Actions. <strong>YOU AND WARGAMING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and Wargaming agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p> <p>22.7 Modifications. In the event that Wargaming makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Wargaming's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Wargaming's address for Notice, in which case your account with Wargaming shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.</p> <p>22.8 Enforceability. If Subsection 22.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 22 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 22 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 22 shall govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.</p> <h2>23.

All rights reserved.</p> <p>This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:</p> <p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1</p> <p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:</p> <p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</p> <p>b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;</p> <p>c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</p> <p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p> <p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p> <p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</p> <p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p> <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p> <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.</p> <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p> <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p> <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p> <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p> <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p> <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.
