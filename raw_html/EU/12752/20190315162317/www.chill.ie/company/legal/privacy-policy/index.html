We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from children.
</p>
<p>
  We take great care with any personal data we hold, so that we provide the highest standard of service to you, whilst taking steps to keep your data secure and to ensure it is only used for the specified, explicit and legitimate purposes stated within this Policy.

<p>
  It is important that you read this Policy and show it to anyone else who is insured under your policy of insurance, including any named drivers, joint policyholders and anyone living at the property insured under your policy, as it also applies to them.
</p>
<p>
  In circumstances where you provide personal data including special categories of data or sensitive data relating to persons other than you who are or will be insured under your policy of insurance, you are confirming that you have obtained the consent of such other persons to the processing of their personal and special categories of data for the purposes set out in this Policy.

  <p>
    We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact our data protection officer at the contact details listed in Section 1 of this Policy. If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so. Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with this Policy, where this is required or permitted by law.

  <h3>
    3.2 Consequences of not providing us with information
  </h3>
  <p>
    You can choose not to give us personal information; however this may have an effect on you. 
We may need to collect personal information by law, or to enter into or fulfil a contract we have with you. If you choose not to give us this personal information, it may delay or prevent us from fulfilling our contract with you, or doing what we must do by law. It may also mean that we cannot provide you with a quote or manage your policies with us which means we may need to cancel a product or service you have with us.

  7. Automated individual decision making including profiling 
</h3>
  <p>
    Automated individual decision making, including profiling, takes place when you request a quote from Chill through our website. The insurance providers we provide quotes on behalf of carry out this automated individual decision making. This means that we run your personal data through algorithms and internal models set by each of the insurance providers to determine your risk profile and calculate your insurance premium.  This process includes the use of information you provide to Chill in your online quote form. For example, some factors that insurance providers would use for a car insurance policy are the age of the vehicle, location where the vehicle is parked and the age of drivers. This may include special categories of data, where relevant, such as Health Data or Criminal Convictions and offences data such as penalty point data. 
  </p>
  <p>
    You have the right to human intervention to express your interests and contest automated decisions.  If for any reason you are not satisfied with the quote obtained via our website please contact our office to request a quote on <a href="tel:01 400 3400">01 400 3400</a>.
For further information on individual insurance provider’s automated individual decision making processes, please refer to their privacy policies.

  8. Retention 
</h3>
  <p>
    We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. This means that the period of time for which we store your personal data may depend on the type of data we hold. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.

  11. International Transfers
</h3>
  <p>
    Some of our suppliers who provide us with services such as IT security or data hosting services may process your personal data such as identity and policy data outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. There are special requirements set out under Chapter V of the GDPR to regulate such data transfers and ensure that adequate security measures are in place to safeguard and maintain the integrity of your personal data on transfer. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Where we transfer your personal data outside the EEA to our suppliers, we will make sure that it is protected to the same extent as in the EEA and we will use at least one of the following safeguards:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Transfer it to a non-EEA country with privacy laws that give the same protection as the EEA</li>
    <li>Put in place a contract with the recipient that means they must protect it to the same standards as the EEA.</li>
    <li>Transfer it to organisations that are compliant with the EU/US Privacy Shield. This is a framework that sets privacy standards for data sent between the US and EU countries. It makes sure those standards are similar to those used and expected within the EEA. </li>
  </ul>

  13. Security
</h3>
  <p>
    Chill Insurance will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy. We will use all reasonable efforts to put in place security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our website; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use reasonable procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
