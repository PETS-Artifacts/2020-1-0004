<h3 id="whoisthedata">Who is the Data Controller? </h3>
<p>Indiegogo, Inc. is the “<i><b>data controller</i></b>” of personal data collected by all of Indiegogo, and Indiegogo, Inc. is responsible for deciding how personal data is collected, used, and disclosed. Campaign Owners may also be data controllers of certain data you provide to Campaign Owners when you make a Contribution to a Campaign or through any other Services.</p>

<p>You should be aware that when you provide information to us using a third-party site or platform, the information you provide may be separately collected by the third-party site or platform. The information we collect is covered by the Indiegogo Privacy Policy only, and the information the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform’s privacy practices. Privacy choices you have made on the third-party site or platform will not apply to our use of the information we have collected directly through our Site or Services. Please also keep in mind that our Site and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Site or Services and to read the policies of other sites that may collect your personal information.</p>

</ul>

<p>You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services. You may pledge to a project as a User by providing only an email address.

<h3 id="europeanresidents">European Economic Area residents: Legal bases for use of your information & controls and choices</h3>
<p>The laws in the European Economic Area and some other jurisdictions require us to provide Users, to the extent those laws apply to such Users, with the following information:</p>
<h4>Legal grounds for use and disclosure of personal information</h4>
<ul>
    <li>As necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you, including to provide for campaign disbursement, manage your Campaign or otherwise comply with the Indiegogo Terms of Use; or</li>
    <li>On the basis of implied or express consent, such as to send you certain information, including marketing communications, to share your information with partners when you have requested we do that, or to collect and process your information for research purposes if you have Contributed to a Campaign, or otherwise agreed; or</li>
    <li>For our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of others such as to ensure the security of our Sites, operate and improve our business and our Sites, respond to your questions, engage in certain marketing, make and receive payments, comply with our legal obligations, prevent fraud, conduct analysis, enforce our Terms, engage in a business change (e.g., sale, merger), to know User to whom we are providing the Service, and to create anonymous data.</li>
    <li>To protect the vital interests of the individual or others. For example, we may collect or share personal data to help resolve an urgent medical situation.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Controls and choices </h4>
<ul>
    <li>In addition, Users in the European Economic Area and some other jurisdictions outside the United States have certain legal rights to obtain confirmation of whether we hold personal data about them, to access personal data we hold about them (including, in some cases, in portable form), and to obtain its correction, update, amendment or deletion in appropriate circumstances. They may also object to our uses or disclosures of personal data, to request a restriction on its processing, or withdraw any consent, though such actions typically will not have retroactive effect. They also will not affect our ability to continue processing data in lawful ways (for example, if you opt out of the use of your telephone number for direct marketing, we might still decide to contact you by phone regarding potential fraud on your account). </li>
    <li>Users in the European Economic Area have the right to opt-out of all of our processing of their personal data for direct marketing purposes. To exercise this right, they may <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</li>
    <li>The rights and options described above are subject to limitations and exceptions under applicable law. In situations in which we process personal data on behalf of our User, we may refer the request to the relevant User and cooperate with their handling of the request, subject to any special contractual arrangement with that User. </li>
    <li>In addition to these rights, Users in the European Economic Area have the right to lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority. However, we encourage you to contact us first, and we will do our very best to resolve your concern.</li>
</ul>

We will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. To dispose of personal data, we may anonymize it, delete it or take other appropriate steps. Data may persist in copies made for backup and business continuity purposes for additional time.</p>

<h3 id="datatransfers">Data transfers, storage, and processing globally</h3>

<p>
    If you are a California resident under the age of 18, and a registered user of any site where this policy is posted, California Business and Professions Code Section 22581 permits you to request and obtain removal of content or information you have publicly posted.
