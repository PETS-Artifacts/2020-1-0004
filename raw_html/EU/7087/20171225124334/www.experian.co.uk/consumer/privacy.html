                                        <p>Establishing your identity is important as the services may provide you with your
                                            personal credit information (such as your credit score or credit report) and

                                            checking the registration information you give us against information we already

                                            to our services and for the collection of any future payments or overdue amounts

                                        <p>Your payment card provider may let us know if the card details relating to your Experian
                                            payment change. If this happens, we reserve the right to update certain card

                                        <p>So for example, if you get a new payment card with a later expiry date to the one
                                            you currently pay with (but all the other details stay the same), we may update
                                            your payment card expiry date accordingly.</p>

                        <p>Experian is based in the UK, which is where our main databases are. We also operate elsewhere in
                            and outside the European Economic Area, so we may access your personal information from and transfer
                            it to these locations as well. Don’t worry though, any personal information we access from or
                            transfer to these locations is protected by European data protection standards.</p>
                        <p>While countries in the European Economic Area all ensure rigorous data protection laws, there are
                            parts of the world that may not be quite so rigorous and don’t provide the same quality of legal
                            protection when it comes to your personal information.</p>
                        <p>To make sure we keep your personal information safe, we apply strict safeguards when transferring
                            it overseas. For example:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Sending your personal information to countries approved by the European Commission as having
                                high quality data protection laws, such as Switzerland, Canada and the Isle of Man.</li>
                            <li>Putting in place a contract that has been approved by the European Commission with the recipient
                                of your personal information that provides a suitable level of high quality protection.</li>
                            <li>Sending your personal information to a member organisation approved by the European Commission
                                as providing a suitable level of high quality protection. For example, the Privacy Shield
