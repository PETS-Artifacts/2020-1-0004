                    <h3>To enable you to access our website and use our services</h3>
                    <p>We will use your information to accept you as a new/returning customer and continue to provide you with our products and services.</p>
                    <h3>To let you know about significant changes to our products, terms or privacy policy</h3>
                    <p>We’ll let you know by email, SMS, push notification or when you log in to the site if there are significant changes to our products or their features which change how we process your personal data.</p>
                    <h3>To confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide</h3>
                    <p>As part of providing services to you we will confirm your identity and authenticate the information you provide for security purposes.</p>
                    <p>Establishing your identity is important as the services may provide you with your personal credit information (such as your credit score or credit report) and we must be sure you are who you say you are. Identity checking may
                      also involve checking the registration information you give us against information we already hold about you as a credit reference agency and potentially publicly available information about you such as from social media.</p>
                    <p>If we are unable to confirm your identity from the registration information you provide, we will let you know by using the contact details you have provided and you may then have the option to make a written application and
                      provide further proof of your identity.</p>
                    <h3>To process payments and collect arrears</h3>
                    <p>We will use your information to process the payments you commit to when signing up to our services and for the collection of any future payments or overdue amounts for those services.</p>
                    <p>Your payment card provider may let us know if the card details relating to your Experian payment change. If this happens, we reserve the right to update certain card details to make sure your access to our services isn’t
                      interrupted.</p>
                    <p>So for example, if you get a new payment card with a later expiry date to the one you currently pay with (but all the other details stay the same), we may update your payment card expiry date accordingly.</p>
                    <h3>To provide and improve customer support</h3>
                    <p>We will use your information to be able to provide and improve the customer support we provide to you (e.g. when you have questions or when you forget your log-in information).</p>
                    <h3>To provide alerts</h3>
                    <p>We will use your information to send you alerts where ‘Alerts’ are part of the service you ask us to provide e.g.</p>
                    <ul class="list-bullet list-marg">
                      <li>web-monitoring when we find your personal details are available to others online.</li>
                      <li>where there are certain changes to your credit report.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>To send you service communications</h3>
                    <p>We will use your information to contact you to tell you about changes to or issues affecting the services you are taking.</p>
                    <h3>To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings</h3>
                    <p>When you use our comparison service to search for products, the information you provide is used to retrieve information about products relevant to your search and create a table which allows you to compare them.</p>
                    <p>Where eligibility ratings are available, information from your credit file with Experian (and sometimes TransUnion and Equifax) is also used to help you understand whether you are likely to be accepted.</p>
                    <p>In some circumstances, we will share that information and your personal information (such as name and address) with brokers, aggregators, insurers, lenders and providers of credit, insurance and other financial products
                      themselves (as described in the section "Who we share your personal information with").</p>

                      information about introductions you’ve requested to brokers and lenders.</p>
                    <h3>To send you product eligibility alerts</h3>
                    <p>As part of our free services (which are available to all customers), Experian will retrieve and use your credit bureau data (whether it’s from Experian or the other two main credit reference agencies Equifax and TransUnion) to
                      check your eligibility (as described in the above section ‘To provide comparison services and create eligibility ratings’) for third party products or services and notify you of credit opportunities, products and services that
                      you may be eligible for.</p>
                    <p>When you log in to the website, we will show you updated eligibility ratings for products and services that may be available to you.</p>
                    <p>As part of this service we may also notify you by e-mail, SMS or post of new or updated eligibility ratings for products and services; for example if new products and services are added, or your eligibility has changed. You
                      can choose not to receive email, SMS and postal communications about product eligibility whenever you want from your Experian Account page.</p>
                    <p>We will check your eligibility for third party products and services, and may send you alerts:</p>

                      <li>when you log in to the website;</li>
                      <li>when you request an eligibility check;</li>

                      <li>when there is a change to your credit bureau data or Experian Credit Score (and we may pro-actively check your credit bureau data and Experian Credit Score to do this – which will not affect your credit rating);</li>
                      <li>when we predict you may be interested in a new credit product or service, for example if your existing promotional period is coming to an end;</li>
                      <li>if you have used our insurance comparison service and our system identifies that your insurance renewal is due, we will resubmit your quote details to give you an idea of what your quotes could be for your next renewal.

                      <li><strong>Marketing (including electronic marketing)</strong><br /> From time to time, we would like to let you know about products, services and offers from Experian and our partners.</li>
                      <li><strong>Helping to prevent and detect crime such as fraud and money laundering</strong><br />Fraud and money laundering cost the British economy many billions of pounds every year. That cost is ultimately passed on to the
                        public in the form of higher prices. By helping to avoid fraud such as identity theft, we help to stop this from happening.</li>
                      <li><strong>Complying with/supporting compliance with legal and regulatory requirements</strong><br />We must comply with various legal and regulatory requirements. Additionally, the services we provide help other organisations
                        to comply with their own legal and regulatory obligations. For example, Experian is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.</li>

                        provide services to third parties which help them to run their businesses more effectively and efficiently.<br />We have put in place various safeguards to ensure that individuals’ whose personal information we handle are not
                        unduly harmed by the activities we use their personal data for. These include making information available to individuals so that they understand how their personal data will be used by Experian, explaining their rights to

            <p>Experian is based in the UK, which is where our main databases are. We also operate elsewhere in and outside the European Economic Area, so we may access your personal information from and transfer it to these locations as well. Don’t

              personal information.</p>
            <p>To make sure we keep your personal information safe, we apply strict safeguards when transferring it overseas. For example:</p>
            <ol class="list-align list-marg">
              <li>Sending your personal information to countries approved by the European Commission as having high quality data protection laws, such as Switzerland, Canada and the Isle of Man.</li>
              <li>Putting in place a contract that has been approved by the European Commission with the recipient of your personal information that provides a suitable level of high quality protection.</li>
              <li>Sending your personal information to a member organisation approved by the European Commission as providing a suitable level of high quality protection. For example, the Privacy Shield Scheme that exists in the US.</li>
