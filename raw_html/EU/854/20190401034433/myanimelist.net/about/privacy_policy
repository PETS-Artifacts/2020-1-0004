    In the course of using our Services, you may provide us, directly and indirectly, with both personal and non-personal information.
    Personal information is information that can be used to identify you as an individual. Non-personal information is information

    or in the aggregate with information collected from other users. Certain non-personal information would be considered a part
    of your personal information if it were combined with other identifiers (e.g., combining your zip or postal code with your
    street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered non-personal
    information if they are taken alone or combined only with other non-personal information (e.g., your viewing preferences).

  <p class="term-text">Your information may also be made available to us when you register with any SNS for use of our Services and/or permit any SNS to share any of your information with us in connection with your use of our Services, including any profile information (such as username, images, date of birth, real name), type of Device, SNS account ID, gender, location information, and your SNS friends' lists, and when any changes are made to that information. By accepting an SNS's applicable terms, you agree and consent to the SNS making such information available to us on those terms.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Promotion services</h3>
  <p class="term-text">If you actively choose to participate in a Promotion, we may request that you provide us with personal information such as your email address or postal address in order to administer your participation in the Promotion.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Duration of Storage</h3>
  <p class="term-text">We will not keep your personal information any longer than needed for the purpose it was collected or than is necessary for legal or legitimate business purposes.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="term-header2" id="cc3">The How</h2>
<div>
  <p class="term-text">As already mentioned, we may collect information from you when you directly interact with our Services and otherwise indirectly through your access to or use of our Services.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Direct interaction</h3>
  <p class="pb8">Direct interaction includes such actions as creating a username, providing an email address, creating a friends' list, chatting with other users, or posting to walls and other forums through our Services. It also includes the sending of pre-formatted messages for various purposes such as to challenge friends to beat a high score. We may store the email address of the friend that you choose to email via our Services, but would only do so for social purposes such as generating friend recommendations. You specifically agree that we shall have the right, but not the obligation, to collect and store the information referred to in this paragraph.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Information from Third Parties</h3>
  <p class="pb8">We may also collect your information from third parties who provide it to us, including other users of our Services.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Cookies</h3>
  <p class="pb8">A cookie is a small string of text placed on your Device. In addition to strictly necessary cookies that enable us to provide our Services (such those that provide your SNS log-in status when that account ID is linked to functionality on the Services), we may use both performance-gauging and functionality-gauging cookies. Performance-gauging cookies reveal how you use the Services, for instance, which content is the most popular, how much time users are spending there, and what advertising is relevant to you, which helps us provide an optimized experience (we may engage third parties to carry out this analysis, and they may set their own "third party" cookies--see "The Who" for more). Functionality-gauging cookies enables us to remember certain choices you make in interacting with the Services, for instance, any geographic location, language, or fonts you choose, which helps us tailor the Services to your preferences. Neither performance-gauging cookies nor functionality-gauging cookies collect information in any way that personally identifies you.</p>
  <p class="pb8">Except for cookies strictly necessary for enabling us to provide our Services, you have the option to disable cookies stored on your browser by changing the options in your browser to stop accepting cookies, or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the content you visit, or by installing opt-out cookies offered by third parties. Note that "flash cookies", which are different from HTTP cookies, may require different treatment for removal of disablement depending on the version of the browser used. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to view or use parts of our Services due to limited functionality. Some cookies we use may be stored using a web-browsing component other than a browser application--these cannot be disabled on your Device, but the information collected does not personally identify you, and does not permit tracking between Services. We generate and collect Session ID and Browser ID by cookies for the user identification.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">"Click-Through URLs"</h3>
  <p class="pb8">Some of our Services, including messaging, may use "click-through URLs" linked to other content on our Services. We track this click-through data to help us determine interest in topics, Services usability, and other measures of user engagement.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Recording information from your Device</h3>
  <p class="pb8">In using our Services, our servers record information sent from your Device, which may include information such as device type, mobile carrier, unique device identifier ("Device Number"), Internet Protocol ("IP") address, email address, browser type, language, Internet service provider, network status, time zone, geo location, referring and exit pages, time spent, information searched for, time and date stamp, clickstream data, and other statistics on your use of our Services; for some games or other software no Device Number is recorded but in those and other cases we may have access to a generated and non-permanent unique identification number functionally matched with your Device ("Matching Number").</p>
</div>


<h2 class="term-header2" id="cc4">The Who</h2>
<div>
  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Our Responsibility for Our Collections</h3>
  <p class="pb8">While we will collect and use your information as explained in this Privacy Policy, as a user of our Services you may be permitted to use and create your own profile, connect with other users of our Services, and send messages and transmit information through various channels. Please remember that any communications you have via our Services, depending on, for example, the functionality of the Services used, may reveal information such as any SNS and/or Services profile(s) you create (including your username(s), profile image(s), and profile status/comments, "Profile") and the content of your communications, making this information publicly available to other users. We are not responsible for the activities of other users or other third parties with whom you choose to provide your information or otherwise interact.</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Interaction with Other Users via Social Features</h3>
  <p class="pb8">As mentioned in "The Why", social interaction is an important part of our Services. You understand and agree that your Profile may be viewable in the Services by other users of the Services and may also be searchable for the purpose of facilitating user-user invitations or other social aspects of the Services. You also understand and agree that certain in-Services achievements/activities of yours may be displayed and viewable in the Services by other users of the Services in connection with social features of the Services. For example, other users of the Services may be able to see your leaderboard ranking, an item you received in a game, or your in-game event history (event ranking, points, etc.). Note that where available you may have the option to change certain aspects of your Profile (e.g., profile image).</p>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Persons and Entities with Whom We May Share Your Information</h3>
  <p class="pb8">To the extent you have agreed in the consent form in section “The What” above, we may share your information as follows:</p>
  <ul class="ul-list">
    <li class="list-style">
      With Third Parties for Industry Analysis and Advertising<br>

      <p class="pt8 pb8">You agree that we may share technical information related to your Device (such as IP address, Matching Number, or Device ID), aggregated non-personal information, and anonymous information with advertisers, ad networks, and analytics analysis entities ("Ad Entities") with whom we have strategic relationships, and Ad Entities may also be permitted to collect such information via cookies and other tracking technologies. This information may be used to undertake user trend analyses, demographic profiling, and analytics, and to provide to you tailored and personalized ads and advertising (behavioural advertising). Please note, though, that some Ad Entities also act as Service Providers (defined below) for us, and in those cases we may share your information as explained below.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-style">
      With our Service Providers<br>

      <p class="pt8 pb8">
        Sharing of your information may also occur where we engage or employ service providers, vendors, or other third parties to help us provide our Services (such as Instabug, Google Cloud Functions and Firebase, Google Analytics, Google Data Studio, or Google Big Query, each a "Service Provider") (e.g., improvement of our Services' features, promotion and marketing, administration, analytics, customer service, cloud storage, hosting, and other related services), to provide the Services on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are being used. Our Service Providers may have access to your personal information only to perform these tasks on our behalf, and they are obligated not to disclose or use your personal information for any other purpose.
      </p>
    </li>

    <li class="list-style">
      With Certain Third Parties in Special Circumstances<br>

      <p class="pt8 pb8">
        At times, we may disclose information about you to law enforcement officials or private parties as we believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of MAL or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity.
      </p>
      <p class="pb8">
        Under another special set of circumstances, for example, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy, we may sell or transfer some or all of our assets, and in this connection we may transfer all of your information, including personal information, to any successor entity.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="fw-b term-header3">Policy Not to Collect Personal Information from Children</h3>
  <p class="pb8">
    None of our Services is intended for children under the age of 13 ("children") and we do not knowingly collect personal information from, or store personal information of, children. We will upon notice or discovery take all reasonable efforts to erase or destroy any such personal information that may have been collected or stored by us without our knowledge.
  </p>
</div>


<h2 class="term-header2" id="cc5">The Where</h2>
<div>
  <p class="term-text">
    You understand and agree that we may transfer your information to and process it outside your country of residence, including in the Unites States. Your consent to this Privacy Policy by accessing or using our Services represents your consent to such transfer and processing.
  </p>
  <p class="term-text">
    The transfer of personal data to recipients outside the EU/EEA is generally prohibited unless:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul-list">
    <li class="list-style">
      the jurisdiction in which the recipient is located is deemed to provide an adequate level of data protection;
    </li>
    <li class="list-style">
      the data exporter puts in place appropriate safeguards (e.g. binding corporate rules; contractual arrangements with the recipient of the personal data, using, for example, the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission, adherence to a code of conduct or certification mechanism together with obtaining binding and enforceable commitments from the recipient) or
    </li>
    <li class="list-style">
      derogation or exemption applies (e.g. where an individual has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer after having been provided with all necessary information about the risks associated with the transfer)
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>


<h2 class="term-header2" id="cc6">Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
<div>
  <p class="term-text">

You understand that by deleting a Matching Number any and all data you had prior to the reset may be lost and irretrievable, and that you may not be able to view or use portions of our Services due to limited functionality.
  </p>
</div>


<h2 class="term-header2">Push and Local Notifications</h2>
<p class="term-text">
