<br />
<strong>Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terror Financing</strong><br />
 <br />
<strong>Purpose of the policy</strong><br />
 <br />
All jurisdictions to varying degrees have requirements that persons in business are required to look out for and then report activities which may be criminal, aimed at money laundering or the financing of terror activity.<br />
 <br />
This policy sets out the organisation&rsquo;s requirements and processes for the identifying, investigation and reporting of improper activity.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Application of the policy</strong><br />
 <br />
This policy is applicable to all stakeholders.  Regulators and law enforcement expect all persons involved in the operation of a business to be concerned and act accordingly.  It is not the case that money laundering only takes place in the financial services.  Anywhere where money moves is potentially exploitable by criminals and terror financers.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Key Definitions</strong><br />
 <br />
<u>Money Laundering</u> is the process whereby money from the proceeds of an illegal activity is made to look like it came from a legitimate source.  A criminal may have stolen $ 1,000 in cash.  In order to conceal where he got the cash from, he might go to a bank and deposit the funds.  This is the &lsquo;placement phase&rsquo; where the dirty funds are mixed with legitimate deposits.  The criminal may transfer the funds between accounts to give the funds the appearance of being legitimate in the &lsquo;layering phase&rsquo;.  Finally the criminal withdraws the funds in the &lsquo;integration phase&rsquo;.  <br />
 <br />
<u>The Money Laundering Reporting Officer</u> or MLRO, is the designated person charged with investigation potential incidents of money laundering and terror financing.  <br />
 <br />
<u>Terror Financing</u> is the process whereby funds are moved to a point where they can be utilised by an organisation planning or supporting terror attacks.<br />
 <br />
<u>Tipping-off</u> is a behaviour whereby a money launderer or terror financer is able to suspect or learn that someone believes they may be acting inappropriately.  Tipping-off is a criminal offence in many jurisdictions.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Typologies</strong><br />
 <br />
Certain kinds of behaviour can alert a stakeholder to an attempt at money laundering or terror financing.  The following examples are by no means extensive.  Generally, if any aspect of a business transaction inclines a stakeholder to look at that aspect more closely, it potentially highlights suspicious activity.<br />
 
<ol>
	<li>Refusing to undergo the Know Your Client (KYC) process;</li>
	<li>Being reluctant to reveal the details behind the source of the funds;</li>
	<li>Outright boasting as the source of the funds or criminal intent;</li>
	<li>Behaving in such a way that makes no commercial sense, such as signing-up for the product and immediately withdrawing;</li>
	<li>Providing KYC details or documents that are incorrect;</li>
	<li>Transacting from a high risk geography.  Certain parts of the world are highlighted from time-to-time as being centres for criminal or terrorist funding activity and are sanctioned.  The MLRO can provide you with a list; or,</li>
	<li>Asking detailed questions around the controls instituted to counter money laundering or terror financing.</li>
</ol>
 <br />
<strong>The KYC Process</strong><br />
 <br />
No business can knowingly deal with a criminal undertaking a crime or terror financer.  No business can deal with someone they reasonably suspect of engaging in such activities.  Should the Business suspect that it is dealing with a party breaking any applicable law, or planning to do so, the Business reserves the right to carry out the KYC Process.<br />
 <br />
The KYC process is a tool enabling the business to establish who it is dealing with and whether they constitute a threat.<br />
 <br />
For <u>individuals</u>, the following original documents (copies are not acceptable) are required to be viewed:<br />
 
<ol>
	<li>A photo ID.  A valid passport, drivers license, or national ID is required.  If there is any doubt as to the suitability of the ID, the MLRO must be consulted;</li>
	<li>Proof of address. A utility bill, rent agreement, mortgage statement is required.  This document is to be less than three months old.</li>
</ol>
 <br />
For <u>companies</u>, trusts or similar organisations, the following documents are required to be viewed:<br />
 
<ol>
	<li>A founding statement (such as that from a registrar or court), a contract (in the case of a partnership), a trust deed, or other proof of formal registration;</li>
	<li>A list of the current directors, trustees, partners, etc.</li>
</ol>
 <br />
The MLRO reserves the right to demand that the KYC process be repeated at any time or that proof of source of funds be immediately supplied.<br />
 <br />
If the parties are never physically present together, the documents supplied are to be certified as original copies by a suitably qualified person (a solicitor, policeman, clergy, etc) along with a statement from that person that the individual is known to them and that they have had sight of the original documentation.<br />
 <br />
No part of the KYC process is to be undertaken by a third party not connected to the business.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
 <br />
<strong>Record keeping</strong><br />
 <br />
Records are kept centrally for a period of five years after the termination of the relationship.  <br />
 <br />
Records are required to be lodged via <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#d992809aabbcbab6abbd99b6b7bcbab6b0b7f7bcac"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c78c9e84b5a2a4a8b5a387a8a9a2a4a8aea9e9a2b2">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a> within three working days of the KYC process having been completed.  The MLRO reserves the right to terminate a relationship if documents are not forthcoming or in a format or state that cannot be opened or interpreted.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<strong>Personal liability</strong><br />
 <br />
No person may suffer civil or criminal consequences or any kind of harassment for having raised a suspicion in good faith.  Failure to treat a matter with the concern and delicacy it requires may result in disciplinary action.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Tipping-off</strong><br />
 <br />
Tipping-off is a criminal offence in many jurisdictions.  Terminating a transaction after a suspicion often amounts to tipping-off.<br />
 <br />
<strong>Making a report</strong><br />
 <br />
Reports are to be e-mailed to <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#c18c8d938e81aeafa4a2aea8afefa4b4"><u><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="5a171608151a35343f39353334743f2f">[email&#160;protected]</span></u></a>.<br />
 <br />
The reports should contain:
<ol>
	<li>The names of all concerned parties;</li>
	<li>The dates at which they became customers and the date or dates at which suspicion arose; and,</li>
	<li>What caused the suspicion to arise and how this came about and other information that may be relevant.</li>
</ol>
 <br />
The MLRO will investigate the incident and may require further documentation or information.  <br />
 <br />
The MLRO will make decision as to whether to file a Suspicious Transaction Report with the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions concerned.<br />
