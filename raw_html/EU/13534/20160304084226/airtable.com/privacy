        <h1>Airtable Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: February 3, 2015</p>
        <p>
            Thanks for using Airtable. Our goal is to empower individuals and organizations to structure and organize data. As such, it is important for us to safely and respectfully secure your data. We are committed to following and continuously evolving best practices to support this principle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your data is yours, and we guard it closely. We do not sell any of your information. We want to be fully transparent on how we collect and use your data, so please read on for more details.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Collect and Use Your Information</h2>
        <h3>ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
            When you create an account, we collect certain “personally identifiable information” or “PII.” This may include your name, email address, gender, zip code, and, if you are using a paid account, postal address, phone number, and credit card billing information. If you choose to create an Airtable account via a third-party service, such as Google, you provide us with your username or user ID so that your identity can be authenticated. Once the authentication is complete, we have the ability to access information based on your privacy policy from that third-party service. We don’t receive or store passwords for any accounts on third-party services.
        </p>
        <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTED USING COOKIES</h3>
        <p>
            We collect certain information through the use of “cookies,” which are small text files saved by your browser when you access websites. You must enable session cookies to login to Airtable, as with many other sites. We may use long-term cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing and to customize and improve Airtable. We may use third-party service providers for the purpose of support, outbound communication, and marketing, and these third-party service providers may place their own cookies on your browser.
        </p>
        <h3>INFORMATION RELATED TO USE OF AIRTABLE</h3>
        <p>
            Airtable automatically records information including IP addresses, browser types, operating systems, pages or features of Airtable used and time spent on each, search terms and other statistics. This information is used to analyze how people use Airtable, and is analyzed in aggregate for the purpose of customizing and improving user experience.
        </p>
        <h3>LOCATION INFORMATION</h3>
        <p>
            In some cases we may convert your IP address into a rough geolocation to improve and personalize Airtable (for example, to display time data in the correct local time).
        </p>
        <h3>Information We Share With Third Parties</h3>
        <p>
            We’ll only share your PII in the following cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                With companies that are contractually engaged in providing us with services, such as data storage, hosting and credit card processing. These companies are obligated by contract to safeguard any PII they receive from us.
            </li>
            <li>
                We need to disclose it as part of a business transaction. Information collected from our users, including PII, could be disclosed or transferred to a third-party acquirer as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition, or asset sale. We will notify you if a different company will receive your PII.  
            </li>
            <li>
                The need to protect ourselves or others, or for other legal reasons. We strongly believe in contesting claims that we believe to be invalid under applicable law, and in protecting you from privacy violations we consider to be abuse of legal systems, whether by individuals, entities or government. However, we reserve the right to disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties if we believe it is reasonably necessary to satisfy or comply with a law, regulation, valid legal process (e.g., subpoenas or warrants served on us), or to protect the rights, property and safety of us or others, and to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.
            </li>
            <li>
                You expressly ask us to do so.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            We may share aggregated non-PII with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.
        </p>
        <h2>Modifying Your Information</h2>
        <p>
            To delete your PII and cancel your account, please send an email to <a href="mailto:legal@airtable.com">legal@airtable.com</a>. We will delete your information as soon as is practicable, but some information may remain in archived or backup copies for our records or otherwise required by law.
        </p>
        <h2>International Transfer</h2>
        <p>
            If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may transfer this information to computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>
        <p>
            Airtable is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13, we will take steps to delete such information from our files as soon as is practicable.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Any information that we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may, however, revise the Privacy Policy from time to time. If a revision is material, as determined solely by us, we will notify you, for example via email. The current version will always be posted to our Privacy Policy page.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@airtable.com">privacy@airtable.com</a>.
