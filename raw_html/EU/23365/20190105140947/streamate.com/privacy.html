<h1>Legal bases for processing (For EEA users)</h1>
<p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have a legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws. The legal basis depends on the Services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
<ul style="padding: 10px;">
<li>a.  We need it to provide you with the Services you requested, including to operate the Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the Services, which includes all processing necessary for the performance of our contract(s) with you;</li>

<li>c.  You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li>
<li>d.  We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have consented to our use of information about you for a specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place.  Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use although, in some cases, this may mean no longer using our services.</p>

<h1>Location of Your data</h1>

<li>a.  To our subsidiaries and affiliates.</li>

To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of ICF Technology, Inc.’s assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which personal information held by ICF Technology, Inc. about our website users is among the assets transferred.</li>
<li>d.  To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it.  For example, if you give us an email address to use the "email a friend" feature of our website, or copy a co-worker on a request being made through our portal, we will transmit the contents of that email/request and possibly your email address to the recipients.</li>
<li>e.  For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
<li>f.  With your consent.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also disclose your personal information:</p>
