        <h1 id="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>We, the Jimdo GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “Jimdo” or “we”) via this Privacy Policy wish to hereby inform Jimdo users and visitors of our websites as to the purpose, type and extent of the processing of personal information. The responsible body for this data processing within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) is the Jimdo GmbH, Stresemannstrasse 375, 22761 Hamburg, Germany (privacy@jimdo.com).</p>
        <p>Our websites and services are constantly being revised and improved. Corresponding thereto, this Privacy Policy shall regularly be revised and updated. This applies in particular to those procedures used by us to carry out usage analysis, as well as those used to measure the effectiveness of advertising methods and comparable services, in particular those belonging to third parties. The current status of each of these services can be found in the tabulation located at the end of this Privacy Policy statement.</p>
        <p>We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally. Thus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union. We operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet. Generally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level. However, we also wish to be completely transparent. For many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative. As a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA. We take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.</p>
        <h2 id="usageofpersonaldata">Usage of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>We collect, process and use personal data (in accordance with the definitions of the German Federal Data Processing Law) and the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in order to provide our services. The promotion of our products and provision of information as regards product functions etc. to Jimdo Users as well as other interested parties is a natural component thereof. The scope of the processing of the personal data concerned depends on whether our websites are merely being visited or alternatively being used by a Jimdo User or more specifically if a registration as a user takes place.</p>
        <h3 id="childrensprivacy">Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>Our websites are generally accessible websites and not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from users who are considered to be children under their respective national laws.</p>
        <h2 id="theprocessingofpersonaldata">The processing of personal data</h2>
        <h3 id="thepurposesofprocessingbyjimdo">The Purposes of Processing by Jimdo</h3>
        <p>Jimdo uses the personal data of the Jimdo user to fulfill the contract with the Jimdo user, as well as to provide our services (Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR), to comply with our legal obligations (Article 6 (1) (c) GDPR) and/or to protect the vital interests of the Jimdo user (Article 6 (1) (d) GDPR).</p>
        <p>This includes the following cases:</p>

        <li><p>to contact the Jimdo user regarding their account by email, fax or live chat, troubleshoot account issues, resolve disputes, enforce fee claims, or provide other necessary customer services;</p></li>

We have introduced appropriate controls, in order to reconcile our interests with the rights of the Jimdo user. On this basis, we use the data as follows:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><p>to improve our services, e.g. by reviewing information related to blocked or crashed pages, so we can identify and fix issues and provide a better user experience;</p></li>
        <li><p>to personalize, measure and improve our advertising based on what the Jimdo user might like;</p></li>
        <li><p>to contact the Jimdo user by e-mail or mail under applicable law, to offer coupons, discounts and promotions, to collect their opinion through surveys or questionnaires, and to inform the Jimdo user about the Jimdo services;</p></li>

        <li><p>to monitor and improve the information security of our services.</p></li>

        <h3 id="informationprovidedbythejimdouserwhencreatinganaccountandenteringintoacontractwithjimdo">Information provided by the Jimdo user when creating an account and entering into a contract with Jimdo:</h3>
        <p>When registering for a Jimdo website, it is necessary to provide an email address and password and to create a user account. The username can be published as part of the system-generated subdomain or web address. The email address is used, among other things, to send notifications about the Jimdo website to the Jimdo user.

The exact data that is collected in each specific case can be reviewed via the respective input forms. A deletion of the user account is possible at any time and can be carried out by the user directly in their user account or via sending a message to Jimdo (privacy@jimdo.com).</p>
        <p>Legal basis: Article 6 (1) (b) GDPR</p>
        <h2 id="signinwithfacebookandgoogle">Sign-in with Facebook and Google+</h2>
        <h3 id="facebookconnect">Facebook Connect</h3>
        <p>If a Jimdo user has a Facebook profile, they can visit our website to create a user account or to register using the social plugin "Facebook Connect" of the social network Facebook, published by Facebook Inc., 1 Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025, USA ("Facebook"), under the so-called single sign-on technique.</p>
        <h3 id="google">Google+</h3>
        <p>Any Jimdo user that has a Google+ account may create a customer account or register using the social plug-in "Google+ Sign-In" of the social network Google+, published by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (" Google+ "), as part of the so-called single sign-on technology.</p>
        <h3 id="thedataprocessingviasinglesignon">The Data Processing via Single Sign-On</h3>
        <p>When the page visitor visits a page of our website that contains such a plugin, his browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook or the Google+ servers. The content of the plugin is transmitted by Facebook or Google+ directly to the browser and integrated into the page. Through this integration, Facebook or Google+ receives the information that the browser has accessed the corresponding page of our website, even if the visitor / user does not have a Facebook or Google+ profile or is currently not logged in to those profiles. This information (including the IP address) is transmitted by the browser directly to a Facebook or Google+ server in the USA and stored there.</p>
        <p>*<em>Legal Basis:</em>  *<br />
        These data processing operations are carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR based on the legitimate interest of Facebook or Google+ in the display of personalized advertising based on the surfing behavior.</p>
        <p>Jimdo shall receive access to the general and public accessible information stored in the respective Facebook/Google+ profile(depending on the personal data settings of the user’s Facebook/Google+ profile), if the user, prior to the registration process provides their express consent to Facebook/Google+, in accordance with Article 6(1) (a) GDPR. This information can include the user ID, name, profile picture and age.</p>
        <p>The data provided by Facebook/Google+ are stored and processed by us to create a user account for the Jimdo user. We only use the data that are necessary to create a user account and only if they have been released by the user via Facebook/Google+. This can include a salutation, first name, last name, address data, country, email address. Conversely, based on the user’s Facebook/Google+ profile, consent, data (such as information about browsing or buying behavior) may be transmitted by us to Facebook/Google+. Where the user deletes this data or removes permission for Jimdo to receive this data via Facebook or Google+, Jimdo shall immediately block the webpage that has been created with the data and in accordance with the deletion note below, delete the data where no statutory obligations prevent the deletion.</p>
        <p>Facebook Inc. and Google LLC participate in and have both certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">Privacy Shield</a> Framework. The purpose and scope of the data collection and the further processing and use of the data by Facebook/Google+ as well as the related rights and setting options for the protection of privacy can be found in Facebook's Privacy Policy / or in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google+ Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p>If the user does not want Facebook/Google+ to directly associate the data collected via our website with their Facebook/Google+ profile, they must first log out of Facebook/Google+ before visiting our website. The visitor can completely prevent the loading of the Facebook/Google+ plugins with add-ons for the browser, e.g. with "<a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>".</p>
        <h2 id="useofpaymentserviceproviders">Use of Payment Service Providers</h2>
        <p>Jimdo processes payments made by the Jimdo user via the following payment service providers:</p>

This log includes information regarding the activity (including used storage space, number of logins, etc.), statistical data (such as e.g. browser type, date and time of access, cookies id and referrer URL) as well as the IP address of the Jimdo-user.

This information includes your request, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request.</p>
        <p>All of the above information is used for analyzing and maintaining the technical operation of the servers and network as well as assisting our anti-abuse measures as a whole, pursuant to Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR and our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our websites.

        <p>Google AdWords stores a cookie for conversion tracking on the computer's hard drive (so-called "conversion cookie") when the site visitor clicks on a Google-served ad. These cookies lose their validity after 30 days and are not used for personal identification. When certain pages are visited on our website, Google and Jimdo may recognize that the page visitor has clicked on the ad and has been redirected to this page.</p>
        <p>The information obtained through the conversion cookies is used to generate statistics for AdWords customers who use conversion tracking. These statistics tell us the total number of users who clicked on the ad served by Google and viewed a page with a conversion tracking tag. More information about Google AdWords Terms of Service and Privacy can be found <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        <p>With Google AdWords Remarketing, Google sets a cookie in the terminal's browser, which automatically enables interest-based advertising by means of a pseudonymous cookie ID and based on the pages visited by the Jimdo user / page visitor. If the user has consented to sharing his web history with Google, then Google can use the history of the visit to the Jimdo website, along with the Google analytics data and the Google AdWords data in order to create targeted audiences for cross device remarketing.

As part of this call, technical information, such as information about the browser and the system, as well as the IP address and time of the retrieval are collected.</p>
        <p>This information is used to improve the technical performance of the services based on the technical data or the target groups and the reading behavior based on their call sites (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. Statistical surveys also include determining if the newsletters will be opened, when they will be opened and which links will be clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the newsletter service provider to observe individual users. The evaluations serve us much more to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to them or to send different content according to the interests of our users.</p>
        <p>The processing of the data entered into the newsletter application form is based solely on consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). The given consent to the storage of the data, the e-mail address and their use for sending the newsletter can be revoked at any time by the Jimdo newsletter subscriber, for example via the "unsubscribe" link in each newsletter. The legality of the data processing that has already taken place shall remain unaffected by the revocation.</p>
        <p>The data provided to Jimdo by the Jimdo User for the purposes of sending the newsletter will be stored by us until the Jimdo User is removed from the newsletter and deleted after the newsletter has been unsubscribed. Data that has been stored for other purposes with us (such as e-mail addresses for the members area) shall remain unaffected by this deletion.</p>

        <h3 id="disquscommentmanagement">DISQUS comment management</h3>
        <p>Based on our legitimate interests in an efficient, secure and user-friendly commentary system for our blog pages we use the comment management service DISQUS.</p>
        <p>In order to use the DISQUS features, users can log in using their own DISQUS user account or existing social media accounts (e.g., OpenID, Facebook, Twitter, or Google). Here, the user credentials are obtained from the platforms through DISQUS. It is also possible to use the DISQUS comment feature as a guest without creating or using user accounts with DISQUS or any of the social media providers listed.</p>
        <p>Jimdo embeds DISQUS with its features on our Jimdo Blog, “8 days”. However, users enter into a direct contractual relationship with DISQUS, in which DISQUS processes users' comments and acts as point of contact for any deletion of users' data. Please refer to the DISQUS privacy policy: <a href="https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy" target="_blank">https://help.disqus.com/terms-and-policies/disqus-privacy-policy</a> in which DISQUS informs users that they save the comment content, as well as store the IP address of the commenter and the timestamp of submission. Disqus also saves cookies on users' computers and may use them to display advertising. However, users may object to the processing of their data to display ads:</p>
        <p>Jimdo reserves the right to delete comments if their content violates the Jimdo Terms of Service. In addition, we reserve the right to stop or remove the comment function and the associated comments on any article, at any time.</p>
        <h2 id="accessandpubliclyavailableinformation">Access and Publicly Available Information</h2>
        <h3 id="thejimdowebsite">The Jimdo Website:</h3>
        <p>All information posted on the Jimdo website of a Jimdo user may, in principle, be accessed by other Internet users e.g. when it is published by the Jimdo user on the Jimdo user’s website. Therefore, the publication of personal information (eg addresses, telephone numbers) and sensitive data (e.g. passwords, access data) should be handled carefully and prudently. Hidden subpages and password-protected areas do not provide absolute protection against unauthorized access; The same applies to uploaded files, as these may be accessible via direct links.</p>
        <h3 id="administrativeaccesstoyourjimdowebsite">Administrative Access to your Jimdo Website:</h3>
        <p>As part of our customer service and error tracing, our employees also have access to the administrative area of Jimdo Websites (CMS) on an ad hoc basis. Administrative access is to be understood as insight into all areas of the corresponding Jimdo website, including the password-protected areas. All our employees are regularly schooled in data protection and are bound to maintain confidentiality and the secrecy of data (§5 of the German Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) or from 25.05.2018 § 53 BDSG (new)).</p>
        <h3 id="encryption">Encryption</h3>
        <p>For the encryption (HTTPS over TLS) of Jimdo websites of the Jimdo user we use the free service "<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>". Through the certificates, we can offer a so-called transport encryption, which protects the communication to a Jimdo website from access by unauthorized third parties.</p>
        <h3 id="rightsofthedatasubjects">Rights of the Data Subjects</h3>
        <p>(i.e. Jimdo user or Jimdo Site Visitor, hereinafter referred to collectively as “Jimdo user”)</p>
        <p>According to the relevant legislation, including the GDPR, the Jimdo user and site visitors have certain rights in relation to their personal data that is processed by Jimdo. In particular, they have a right to information, correction, transferability or <a href="http://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-17-right-to-erasure-'right-to-be-forgotten'-GDPR.htm" target="_blank">deletion</a> of their data. The Jimdo user also has the right to object to certain processing of their data.</p>
        <p>In some cases, it will not be possible to change or remove content after it has been published on the Jimdo website. Upon receipt of such request, Jimdo may close the corresponding Jimdo Account and remove the offending personal information from public areas as soon as possible based on account activity and applicable law. The legal right to information, correction or deletion of personal data remains unaffected.</p>

        <p>The Jimdo user can usually access, verify and edit their personal information in their Jimdo account by logging in and directly updating or deleting the appropriate information.</p>
        <p>We are happy to inform you, which personal data we have stored on you, as well as any fees incurred under applicable law. The information will be processed by us immediately and is usually sent via email. In order to receive detailed information, please inform us as far as possible as to the type of personal data requested. To be sure that the requesting person is also the person whom they claim to be, we require proof of identity. This can be a copy of an official identity document. Please ensure that serial numbers, passport numbers or similar are blackened out or removed. We use this copy solely for identification and processing of the request and delete it as soon as it has served its purpose.</p>
        <h3 id="righttoobject">Right to Object</h3>
        <p>Insofar as the Jimdo user’s or site visitor’s data is collected on the basis of Jimdo’s legitimate interests (Article 6(1) (f) GDPR, the Jimdo user/site visitor may object to the future processing of their data in accordance with Article 21 GDPR at any time, for the future. The objection may in particular be expressed against processing for direct marketing purposes(via sending an email to <a href="&#109;&#x61;i&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#x3a;p&#x72;&#105;&#x76;&#97;&#x63;y&#64;&#106;&#x69;&#109;d&#x6f;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#112;&#114;&#x69;&#x76;&#x61;&#x63;&#x79;&#64;&#x6a;&#x69;&#109;&#x64;&#x6f;&#46;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> or unsubscribing directly from such communications via the unsubscribe link in every mail). A corresponding note as regards the Jimdo Newsletter unsubscription process can be found in every newsletter email.</p>
        <p>If the Jimdo user makes use of his right to object, Jimdo will stop the processing of the data concerned. However, further processing is reserved if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate reasons for the processing that outweighs the interests of the Jimdo user, their fundamental rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves the purpose of asserting, exercising or defending legal claims. If Jimdo is asked to cease all or any part of the processing of the personal information, or if the Jimdo user revokes his consent (if any) to the use or disclosure of their personal information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, Jimdo may cease to be able to provide all Jimdo services to the Jimdo user.</p>
        <p>The Jimdo user also has the right to object to the processing personal data that is used for statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89 (1) GDPR for reasons that arise from their particular situation via a simple email to that effect sent to privacy@jimdo.com.</p>
        <h3 id="righttodataportability">Right to Data Portability</h3>
        <p>In certain cases, which are listed in detail in Art. 20 GDPR, the site visitor or the Jimdo user has the right to receive personal data concerning him or her, in a structured, common and machine-readable format or to have this data transferred to a third party upon demand.</p>

However, Jimdo will give the reasons in these cases.</p>
