        <p class="wt-cm-section-content__paragraph">
           We, the Jimdo GmbH (hereinafter referred to as “Jimdo” or “we”) via this Privacy Policy wish to hereby inform Jimdo users and visitors of our websites as to the purpose, type and extent of the processing of personal information. The responsible body for this data processing within the meaning of the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) is the Jimdo GmbH, Stresemannstrasse 375, 22761 Hamburg, Germany (privacy@jimdo.com).
        </p>
        <p class="wt-cm-section-content__paragraph">
           Our websites and services are constantly being revised and improved. Corresponding thereto, this Privacy Policy shall regularly be revised and updated. This applies in particular to those procedures used by us to carry out usage analysis, as well as those used to measure the effectiveness of advertising methods and comparable services, in particular those belonging to third parties. The current status of each of these services can be found in the tabulation located at the end of this Privacy Policy statement.
        </p>
        <p class="wt-cm-section-content__paragraph">
           We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally. Thus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union. We operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet. Generally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level. However, we also wish to be completely transparent. For many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative. As a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA. We take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.

The promotion of our products and provision of information as regards product functions etc. to Jimdo Users as well as other interested parties is a natural component thereof. The scope of the processing of the personal data concerned depends on whether our websites are merely being visited or alternatively being used by a Jimdo User or more specifically if a registration as a user takes place.

If Jimdo is asked to cease all or any part of the processing of the personal information, or if the Jimdo user revokes his consent (if any) to the use or disclosure of their personal information for purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, Jimdo may cease to be able to provide all Jimdo services to the Jimdo user.
