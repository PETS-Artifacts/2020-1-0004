                        <p>We would also like to note the following as regards to the usage of service providers located outside of the European Union: Jimdo is a service that is offered internationally. Thus, it extends not only beyond the federal republic of Germany, but also beyond the European Union. We operate worldwide and our users are scattered across this planet. Generally we give priority to European service providers when selecting particular services and service offerings, especially where such providers can deliver the required services at a comparable and competitive price and service level. However, we also wish to be completely transparent. For many of the services that we use there is simply no comparable, acceptable alternative. As a result we therefore employ the use of a range of service providers outside the European Union, in particular from the USA. We take steps to ensure that measures according to European Data Protection law are taken and applied so as to guarantee an adequate level of data protection.</p>

Conversely, based on the user’s Facebook/Google+ profile, consent, data (such as information about browsing or buying behavior) may be transmitted by us to Facebook/Google+. Where the user deletes this data or removes permission for Jimdo to receive this data via Facebook or Google+, Jimdo shall immediately block the webpage that has been created with the data and in accordance with the deletion note below, delete the data where no statutory obligations prevent the deletion.</p>
                        <p>Facebook Inc. and Google LLC participate in and have both certified their compliance with the EU-U.S. <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">Privacy Shield</a> Framework.

                        <p>With Google AdWords Remarketing, Google sets a cookie in the terminal's browser, which automatically enables interest-based advertising by means of a pseudonymous cookie ID and based on the pages visited by the Jimdo user / page visitor. If the user has consented to sharing his web history with Google, then Google can use the history of the visit to the Jimdo website, along with the Google analytics data and the Google AdWords data in order to create targeted audiences for cross device remarketing. The user can permanently disable the setting of such cookies by installing the browser plug-in available at the following link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a></p>

                        <p>Jimdo also uses the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick from the provider Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
                        <p>This feature allows the Google Analytics remarketing ad groups described above, to be linked to the cross-device features of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. In this way, interest-based, personalized advertising messages that have been adapted to the particular user based on their previous usage and browsing behavior on one terminal (e.g., cell phone) may also be displayed on another user's terminal (e.g., tablet or PC).</p>
                        <p>Once the user has given their consent, Google links the web and app browsing history to the corresponding Google account for this purpose. In this way, the same personalized advertising messages can be displayed on each device on which the user logs on with his Google Account.
                        To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users who are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.
                        The site visitor can permanently object to cross-device remarketing / targeting by disabling personalized ads in their Google Account: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>. 
                        If the site visitor wishes to object to Google's general tracking process, the conversion tracking cookies can be disabled by setting the browser to block cookies from the domain <a href="http://www.googleadservices.com:" target="_blank">www.googleadservices.com:</a> <a href="https://www.google.de/settings/ads" target="_blank">https://www.google.de/settings/ads</a>.</p>
                        <p>The aggregation of the collected data in the Google account of the site visitor takes place exclusively on the basis of his consent, which he can give or revoke on Google (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). For data collection operations that are not merged into the user’s Google Account (for example, because they do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The legitimate interest arises from the fact that Jimdo has an interest in the anonymous analysis of the website visitors for advertising purposes.</p>

The Braze Privacy Policy can be viewed at any time under: <a href="https://www.braze.com/privacy/" target="_blank">https://www.braze.com/privacy/</a></p>
                        <p>The legal basis for the use of the service provider Braze, is that of valid consent (Article 6 (1)(a) GDPR). Braze can use the data of the recipients in pseudonymous form only, i.e.  without assignment to a specific user, in order to optimize or improve their own services, e.g. for the technical optimization of the sending and the presentation of the newsletter or for statistical purposes. However, Braze is not permitted to use the data of our newsletter recipients in order to contact them themselves, nor are they permitted to pass this data on to third parties.</p>
                        <p><em>Newsletter Performance:</em><br />
                        Our newsletters contain so-called "web-beacons", i.e. pixel-sized files that are retrieved from our server or when used,from the Server of the service provider, Braze, when opening the newsletter. As part of this process, technical information, such as information about the browser and the system used, as well as the IP address and time of the retrieval are collected.</p>
                        <p>This information is used to improve the technical performance of the newsletter services based on the technical data or the target groups and the reading behavior based on the Subscriber's access location (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or the access times. The Statistical data collected also includes determining if the newsletters is opened, when they are opened and which links are clicked. For technical reasons, this information can be assigned to the individual newsletter recipients. However, it is neither our goal nor, if used, that of the newsletter service provider, to observe individual users. These evaluations serve rather to recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our content to their preferences or to send them more suitable content in accordance with their interests.</p>
                        <p><em>Unsubscribing:</em><br />
                        The processing of the data entered into the newsletter application form is based solely on consent (Article 6 (1) (a) GDPR). The consent provided can be revoked at any time by the Jimdo newsletter subscriber, for example via the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of each newsletter or via the checkbox in the Login area of the user’s account. The legality of the data processing that has already taken place shall remain unaffected by the revocation of the user’s consent.</p>
                        <p>The data provided to Jimdo by the Jimdo newsletter subscriber for the purposes of sending the newsletter will be stored by Jimdo, until the newsletter Subscriber is removed from the newsletter list, and shall be deleted after the newsletter Subscriber has been unsubscribed. Data that has been stored for other purposes with us (such as e-mail addresses for the Jimdo User’s login area) shall remain unaffected by this deletion.</p>
