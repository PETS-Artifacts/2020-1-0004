Privacy policy hoplr
</div>
You might not always be aware but using HOPLR implies releasing some personal data. According to the legal definition, personal data is data that allows the identification of a natural person. It is sufficient when the data allow us to lay a, direct or indirect, link between one or more data-pieces and a natural person.
<br/><br/>
The collection and processing of personal data is governed by strict legislative conditions in order provide you as a user the necessary guarantees that you personal data will not be inappropriately disclosed. Each processing should therefore always be consistent with the legislation, primarily the Belgian Law of 8 December 1992 on the protection of privacy (Privacy Act).
<br/><br/>
As we also consider the protection of your privacy very important and want to be very clear about this, we have prepared this Privacy Statement. By providing this Privacy Statement, HOPLR responds to the information-duty under Article 9 Privacy Law. The structure of this document follows the structure of the law. This Privacy Statement is fully consistent with the Privacy Act, and is only about the collection of 'personal data'.
<br/><br/>
While using HOPLR and its services, we assume that each user has taken note of this Privacy Statement. We consider that you accept to the collection and processing of personal information that is in accordance to this privacy statement. 
<br/><br/>

Any substantial change will be clearly communicated.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="margin-bottom fontweight-bold fontsize-medium color-brandtext">
The data controller?
</div>
The Privacy Act makes a distinction between the controller and the parties in appeals where the actual processing. Giving a clear notice of this distinction is extremely important to avoid some ambiguity about responsibilities.
<br/><br/>
The (data) controller is every natural person and/or legal entity which determines the purposes and the means (legal and technical) of the processing of personal data. This determination can be done alone or jointly with others. The controller behind HOPLR is;

<div class="margin-bottom fontweight-bold fontsize-medium color-brandtext">
The data processor?
</div>
The actual processor is any natural person or legal entity that processes on behalf of the data controller the personal data. The data processor is responsible for the proper technical operation of the website (data transmission). A person should not be regarded as processor if he is processing the personal data under the direct authority of the data controller, such as his employees or similar personnel. 
<br/><br/>
The data controller has been extremely careful in his selection of actual processor. The processor must offer the adequate guarantees with regard to technical and organizational security measures regarding the processing and at the same time satisfy the requirements of Article 16, § 1 Privacy Act.
<br/><br/>
The controller is not responsible for any loss or corruption of personal data, identity theft, data theft, viruses or Trojans, SQL injections or other attacks on computer systems or online portals cloud. The processor decides in an autonomous way over the most technically appropriate application to process the data. The processor gained professional expertise in this domain. The data controller cannot be expected to have the same expertise. At this time, HOPLR does not make use of an external data processor.
