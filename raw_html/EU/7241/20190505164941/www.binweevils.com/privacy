            <h2 id="pp-1">1. What we collect on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform</h2>
            <p>
                We do not purposely or knowingly collect personal information from you, except under limited exceptions set forth below. Information and content provided by Players goes through our moderation process, which includes technical analysis, automated text moderation, and trained, human moderators. The purpose of the moderation process is to remove any personal information or inappropriate content entered by Players before it is posted on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform or shared with other Players.
            </p>

            <h3>User Profile</h3>
            <p>
                Creating an account on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform does not require, or permit, the use of any personal information. When you sign up for the 55 Pixels Kids Platform, you create an anonymous account, including a username which is then publicly available inside the 55 Pixels Kids Platform. You may not use your real name, or any other information that could identify you or your location in the creation of your account or in posting content to 55 Pixels. Your 55 Pixels account contains:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Username, which may not contain your real name;</li>
                <li>In-game Character;</li>
                <li>Your membership status</li>
                <li>Login status/recency</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Plus the following which are not visible to other players:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your Buddies in the 55 Pixels Kids Platform, but these are not visible to other players;</li>
                <li>Information about your progress and position within the game</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Chat and Messaging</h3>
            <p>
                Players can chat and message other players in a virtual public area. All chat and messages are moderated and filtered using best of breed moderation technology with human supervision and with tightly controlled kid-specific filtering rules.
                <br><br>Players may block any or all requests to become ‘Buddies’ and for direct chat/messaging.
                <br><br>Players can search for each other on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform with a username using the search and browsing tools on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform.
            </p>

            <h3>Communicating with Us</h3>
            <p>
                Players may also provide us with personal information by communicating directly with us. For example, if you choose, you may use one of our public email addresses to contact us. If you write to us (or otherwise contacts us), we may ask you to put us in contact with a parent or guardian, through whom we can then provide support. We may also ask you to prove to us that you are the parent of the owner of the Player account you are communicating with us about.
                <br><br>Consistent with the one-time use exception under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we only use players’ contact information to respond to inquiries, and we then delete Players’ email addresses from our servers.
            </p>

            <h3>Password Recovery</h3>
            <p>
                You have the option of providing a parent/guardian email address to enable us to recover your password if you forget it. When requesting a password reset, we will ask you for this email address. We will then anonymise the email address by ‘hashing’ it, compare the anonymised hashes of your email address to confirm your identity, and then send you a password reset link using (but not storing) the email address.
            </p>

            <h3>Other Non-personal information</h3>
            <p>
                We collect other non-personal information about Players whenever they interact with the 55 Pixels Kids Platform. Non-personal information includes the number and frequency of visitors to the 55 Pixels Kids Platform and the length of their stays and how they interact with the Platform, browser name, the type of computer, and technical information about the means of connection, such as the operating system. Information also includes player IP addresses, which we use solely for the internal support of the 55 Pixels Kids Platform, such as security, system administration, and in case requested by law enforcement.
                <br><br>Information (including stored chat and messages) relating to Players who do not have an active membership and who have not logged in to the 55 Pixels Kids Platform within two years is deleted at the next inactive data purge or sooner. Inactive data purges take place at least twice per year.
            </p>

            <h2 id="pp-2">2. Why we collect information on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform</h2>
            <p>
                As set forth above, we collect personal information to serve our legitimate commercial business interests while protecting Players’ privacy. Specifically, we collect email addresses to allow us to respond to their questions or requests, including requests to reset user passwords; and we collect persistent identifiers (e.g., IP addresses) to support the internal operations of the 55 Pixels Kids Platform. We use the non-personal information we collect to improve Players’ experiences, and our products and services.
            </p>

            <h2 id="pp-3">3. How we protect Player Information</h2>
            <p>
                55 Pixels takes reasonable steps to protect against possible breaches of the 55 Pixels Kids Platform. We adopt and implement appropriate and reasonable security practices regarding the collection, storage and processing of the information we collect, such as encryption. We also put in place physical safeguards such as limited employee access and confidentiality agreements with employees and contractors.
                <br><br>Despite our efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable. In the event we experience a data breach involving unencrypted personal information, we will notify Players by posting notice on the affected 55 Pixels website or app.
            </p>

            <h2 id="pp-4">4. Sharing Players’ Personal Information</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others, and will not do so except as required by law or in connection with a merger, asset sale or similar business transaction (as described below). We may share aggregated demographic or non-personal information not linked to any personal information regarding visitors and Players with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers. Moreover, as set forth below, we use third-party service providers to help us operate our business and the 55 Pixels Kids Platform or administer activities on our behalf.
            </p>

            <h3>Service providers</h3>

            <p>
                We may use cookies, local storage and other tracking technologies to collect information about visitors to the 55 Pixels Kids Platform and to help optimise their user experience. Cookies and local storage are a way of remembering a Player or visitor based on their device. Cookies are pieces of information that a website sends to a user’s computer while the user is viewing the website. A user can choose to have his or her computer warn the user each time a cookie is sent, or the user can choose to turn off all cookies. Players can do this through their browsers’ (e.g., Edge, Firefox, Chrome) settings. If a user turns off cookies, the user may not have access to certain features that make the web experience smoother.<br><br>
                Cookies are used for internal support only and are not linked to Players’ personal information.
            </p>

            <h3>Do Not Track disclosure</h3>

                Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Currently, our system does not support and does not act on DNT signal headers that we may receive.

            <h2 id="pp-7">7. Advertisements</h2>
            <p>
                We may serve advertising from child-friendly brands. Advertising supports us in keeping the 55 Pixels Kids Platform free to use. Any ads we serve will be delivered by ad serving technology which has been designed to be compliant with COPPA and is certified as such by the ESRB Privacy Certified and kidSAFE COPPA Certified, or other such certification programs. Such advertisements will only be targeted based on the context or content you are viewing on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform, and not on your historical browsing behaviour. All ads served in the 55 Pixels Kids Platform will carry the SuperAwesome SafeAd watermark, which indicates that (a) the ad is not collecting personal information in contravention of COPPA, (b) its content has been reviewed for compliance with best practice and the CARU self-regulatory principles to be appropriate for children, and (c) it is age-appropriate for the 55 Pixels Kids Platform. If you have any questions about advertising on the 55 Pixels Kids Platform or concerns about specific ads that you see, please contact us on <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5525273c2334362c156060253c2d3039267b363a38"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="c1b1b3a8b7a0a2b881f4f4b1a8b9a4adb2efa2aeac">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

            <h2 id="pp-8">8. Access, Modify, Delete and Other User Rights</h2>
            <p>
                Notwithstanding the limited nature of the personal information we collect from or about the Players on our 55 Pixels Kids Platform, Players or their parents have the right to request access to review and/or modify (including delete) personal information about a player. Players or their parents may also contact us to request certain information regarding our disclosures to third parties for direct marketing purposes. However, we do not share information with third parties for this purpose.<br><br>

                If a user or parent wishes to exercise any of the above rights, please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#6616140f1007051f265353160f1e030a154805090b"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="7e0e0c17081f1d073e4b4b0e17061b120d501d1113">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or using the information within Section 10 of this Privacy Policy.<br><br>

                Chat posted in the 55 Pixels Kids Platform may be publicly viewable during that player session. Players are prohibited from communicating personal or inappropriate information at any time, and we take reasonable steps to screen all messages/chat to remove any such information. Should you wish to edit or remove any message/chat after it has been posted, you may contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3c4c4e554a5d5f457c09094c554459504f125f5351"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="e090928996818399a0d5d5908998858c93ce838f8d">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> or using the information within Section 10 of this Privacy Policy. Removal of the information from public view does not guarantee complete or comprehensive removal, however. After the removal request has been honoured, we may retain copies of the messages/chat. Additionally, we do not have control over third parties (e.g., other Players) who may have copied or reposted this information.<br><br>

                You also have the right to lodge a complaint with an EU supervisory data protection authority.
