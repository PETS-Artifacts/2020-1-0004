<p>
<strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong>

<strong>Effective: June 12, 2015</strong> </p>

<p>
<strong>Background Regarding The Trade Desk&rsquo;s Technology and Services</strong>

The Trade Desk (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) is an online advertising and technology platform headquartered in the United States. We provide this privacy policy to inform you about how our technology platform (&ldquo;Technology&rdquo;) processes information on behalf of online advertisers, website owners, data providers and other businesses that use our services (collectively, our &ldquo;Clients&rdquo;). This policy also outlines our privacy practices for our corporate website, which is located at <a href="http://thetradedesk.com/">www.thetradedesk.com</a> (the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;).  If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@thetradedesk.com">privacy@thetradedesk.com</a>.

The Trade Desk runs a buying platform for media and data. The Trade Desk Technology allows our Clients to buy ad space on websites for online advertising and allows for the use of proprietary and third party data in the purchase of that media.  When ad space on or within a website or mobile application is bought or sold (usually to an advertiser or ad agency by a web publisher) the Technology, fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to Internet and mobile users who visit that site or use that application.  Generally, an Internet user&rsquo;s computer, browser or device comes into contact with The Trade Desk when a user views an ad, or visits a website (or uses an app), delivered or serviced by or with our Technology.  Serving users relevant advertising is sometimes referred to as interest based advertising or online behavioral advertising (&ldquo;<a href="http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/#oba">OBA</a>&rdquo;). </p>

<p>
<strong><u>PRIVACY PRACTICES FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY</u></strong> </p>

<p>
<strong>Information Our Technology Collects</strong>

We believe that consumers prefer more (rather than less) relevant ads, tailored to their interests.  To do this, we collect a variety of data from Clients and across platforms, to help optimize ads and increase the likelihood that a particular unique, but anonymous users will be interested in (rather than potentially annoyed by) an ad they see.  For more information on the technology used to collect the below information, please refer to the below section titled &ldquo;Cookies, Web Beacons and Mobile SDKs.&rdquo;
</p>

<ul><li>Our Technology collects Non-Personally Identifiable Information (&ldquo;Non-PII&rdquo;) that may include, but is not limited to, your IP host address, the date and time of the ad request, pages viewed, browser type, the referring URL, Internet Service Provider, and your computer&rsquo;s operating system, as well as how you interact with a web page or ad. We may also collect Non-PII such as age, gender, income, education, interests, and usage activity from Clients or other third parties.  We also may collect analogous Non-PII from mobile platforms, which may include information about your interactions with those applications (including your IP address and time-stamp information), and information about your mobile device (including device type, handset name, operating system information, mobile identifiers such as Apple IDFA and Android Advertising ID, app-specific identifiers, and a list of the applications your device interacts with).</li>
	<li>Sometimes, we obtain the above information from other ad platforms, application platforms or providers, customers or websites and services (including our Clients).  We may work with Clients to synchronize or &ldquo;sync&rdquo; unique, anonymous identifiers to match our Clients&rsquo; non-PII data or identifiers to our own, in order to , enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus, and thus  enable or send ads that are more relevant,  match consumers to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.</li>
</ul><p><strong>How We Use Information Our Technology Collects</strong></p>

<p>The Trade Desk uses Non-PII to target and serve relevant advertising to consumers and to perform attribution analysis or other analytics regarding advertising audiences, as well as to compile, match and link audiences on behalf of Clients.  For instance, we may use this non-PII, generally on behalf of Client, to:</p>

<ul><li>Determine what ad to show a consumer, and customize ads to particular types of audiences;</li>
	<li>Customize ads to the type of web page users are viewing;</li>
	<li>Limit the number of times a consumer sees an ad or a type of ad;</li>
	<li>Perform analysis of how&nbsp;effective the&nbsp;ads are;</li>
	<li>Help advertisers learn more about their own consumers.</li>
</ul><p>Sometimes we may use or make available to Clients the non-PII we collect or receive (such as IP Address) to recognize users or try to resolve a commonality of users (or households) across platforms or across devices, such as smartphones, computers, tablets or related browsers.  For instance, we might infer that a common IP address seen across different devices represents a common user (or a related or similar user), and use that inference in tailoring ads.  Occasionally, we receive anonymized data sets (which may constitute hashed or obfuscated personally identifiable information (&ldquo;PII&rdquo;)), in order to promote, test or validate the accuracy of such inferences.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies,  Web Beacons and Mobile SDKs</strong></p>

<p>In order to help make the online advertisements more relevant to users, our Technology uses the standard &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on users&rsquo; computers about users&rsquo; visits to certain websites. We also use cookies to understand users&rsquo; browsing and buying activities so that we can measure the success of online advertising campaigns we run.</p>

<p>Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users&rsquo; computer when they visit a website. Cookies are stored as text files on users&rsquo; hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user visits a website or views an advertisement. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user&rsquo;s website visits &ndash; for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information helps companies improve a user&rsquo;s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, making the website easier to use, measuring the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailoring their website (including the ads and offers they receive) to better match a user&rsquo;s interests and preferences.<em> .</em> Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive.</p>

<p>The Trade Desk cookie is set to expire after one year; our opt-out cookie lasts longer.   Our cookie expiration may reset upon further interaction between ourselves (or as applicable a Client) and a browser or device.</p>

<p>The Trade Desk also uses web beacons (also known as 1&times;1 gifs), along with cookies, to determine if a user has visited a particular website. These beacons aid in providing more relevant advertising to the user, as well measuring the success of an advertising campaign, but provide no personally identifiable information.</p>

<p><strong><u>HTML5 and Locally Stored Objects.</u></strong>  Similar to cookies are &ldquo;locally stored objects,&rdquo; which we may also use for storing non-PII.  Locally stored objects, such as HTML5 Web Storage, are used for similar purposes as cookies but typically may contain a greater amount and different types of data than browser cookies.  Most current versions of common web browsers clear this locally stored data when you delete or clear your cookie cache.  To confirm whether this is the case for the browser you are using, or to learn more about how to precisely control this data storage, please consult the Help function of your browser.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Device Identifiers and SDKs.</strong>  We may sometimes work with Clients that use mobile SDKs to collect information.  A mobile SDK is the mobile app version of a pixel tag or beacon (see those descriptions, above).  The SDK is a bit of computer code that app developers can include in their apps to enable ads to be shown, data to be collected, and related services to be implemented.  We may use this technology, or work with others who use this technology, to deliver certain advertising through mobile applications and browsers based on information associated with mobile devices.  If you&rsquo;d like to opt-out from having ads tailored to you in this way on your mobile device, please follow the instructions in the &ldquo;<a href="#Choices">Choices</a>&rdquo; section below.</p>

<p><strong>Information Sharing</strong></p>

<p>The Trade Desk may share the non-PII that we collect and receive in various ways.</p>

<ul><li>Primarily, we may work with Clients and other third parties to help optimize ads and make them more likely to be relevant to consumers, by comparing, syncing and sharing the non-PII described above.  For instance, we may disclose to other ad platforms, customers or websites and services (including our Clients), non-PII we have collected (generally, unique, anonymous identifiers representing consumers&rsquo; browsers), to match their unique identifiers to our own, so that we can &ldquo;sync&rdquo; identifiers in order to help them show more relevant ads, match consumers to their likely interests, or better synchronize, cap, or otherwise optimize advertising.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Further, the non-PII we collect and receive may be processed on our behalf by third-party service providers that assist us in running our business, including providers of data storage and processing facilities.</li>
</ul><ul><li>We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual activities that may harm any person, our company, the Technology, or otherwise violate any law.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Also, in the event The Trade Desk is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of The Trade Desk&rsquo;s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by The Trade Desk may be among the items transferred in that transaction.</li>
</ul><ul><li>Finally, we  may share aggregated, non-personal information with Clients in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis (such as the creation of predictive models).</li>
</ul><p><strong>Your Opt-Out Choices </strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to opt-out from having The Trade Desk use your Non-PII in connection with ad targeting based on your behavioral activity, please click <a href="http://www.adsrvr.org/">here</a>. When you opt out, we will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII to tailor our online advertising campaigns.  Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser or update or re-install your current browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice. Please also note that if you choose to disable this function, your online experience may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.</p>

<p>The online advertising industry also provides websites from which you may opt-out of receiving targeted ads from our data and advertising partners.  You can access these, and also learn more about targeted advertising and consumer choice and privacy, at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">http://www.aboutads.info</a> and at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/</a>. If you are located in the EU you can access this information at <a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu">http://www.youronlinechoices.eu</a>.</p>

<p>You may also opt out of ad tracking on devices such as iPhones, iPads, or iPods, or Android Devices.  For the most effective and up to date methods of doing so, you should consult your device settings, and instructions provided by those device manufacturers.  However, we provide the following exemplary information solely for informational purposes, and we disclaim any warranty or representation that the below opt out methods will work in all cases, or that they are most current.</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out on iOS Devices Such as iPhones, iPads or iPods</strong></p>

<p>If you have an Apple device, you can opt out of our behaviorally targeted advertising services by updating to iOS 6.0 or higher, and setting Limit Ad Tracking to &lsquo;ON&rsquo;. You can do this by clicking on Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About -&gt; Advertising and toggling Limit Ad Tracking to &lsquo;ON&rsquo;. Our systems are designed to respect your choice and not use information to provide interest-based advertising when this setting is ON.  Again, you should consult Apple&rsquo;s support web pages and instructions for the most current applicable settings.</p>

<p><strong>Opting Out on Android Devices</strong></p>

<h4>If you have an Android device and would like to opt out of our behaviorally targeted advertising services, you may do this as follows:</h4>

<ol><li>Open the Google Settings app on your device</li>
	<li>Select Ads</li>
	<li>Either &ldquo;Reset advertising ID&rdquo; or</li>
	<li>Opt out of interest-based ads</li>
</ol><p>Our systems are likewise designed to respect these choices transmitted by your Android device.  Again, however, please consult Google&rsquo;s settings and instructions for the most current settings information.</p>

<p><strong>Data Storage and Security</strong></p>

<p>We retain the non-Personally Identifiable Information collected via our Technology for up to eighteen months. After 18 months (or sooner) the data is stored in aggregate for up to three years.</p>

<p>The security of your information is important to us.  The Trade Desk has implemented security measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that our Technology collects, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

<p><strong>Changes To Our Policy</strong></p>

<p>We may revise this policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to the policy will be updated directly on this page. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review our current privacy policy so that you will always know what information we gather and how we may use that information.</p>

<p>The Trade Desk operates the Technology from servers located in the United States of America and the information it collects through Clients is processed in the United States of America.  Laws governing the collection and use of data in the United States may not be equivalent to those in the country where you reside, but The Trade Desk will at all times protect your data in accordance with this Policy.</p>
