Additionally, we will access and share account or other personal data when we believe it is necessary to comply with law, to protect our interests or property, to prevent fraud or other illegal activity perpetrated through the Service or using the Duolingo name, or to prevent imminent harm.

Duolingo uses age-gating to restrict what services are available to children depending on the age of the user and the applicable laws of their country. For example, a 15 year old child in Germany will require parental consent to use the Service, whereas a 12 year old child in the United States of America would receive a restricted service but not require parental consent.</p><h4>Children within the European Union</h4><p>Each European Union (EU) member state is permitted to legally define its own digital age of consent between 13 and 16. Duolingo checks the age and country of the user to determine if the user is able to consent to the Service. If consent of a parent/guardian is required, the user will input the e-mail address of an adult who will receive a request to approve the child’s account registration. In the absence of a country specific Act of Law, the age of consent will be set at 16.</p><p>These EU child users will receive the following service restrictions: they will not be able to use the service until their parent/guardian has provided consent for the child to do so. After the parent/guardian has given consent, they child will be allowed to access the full Duolingo service.</p><p>Where Duolingo does make features and services available to children, we recognize that collecting personal data from children requires further privacy protections. Accordingly, Duolingo will: (1) notify parents or guardians about Duolingo’s privacy and information practices regarding children, including what personal data we collection and how we use, share, and protect that personal data; (2) limit our collection of personal data to ensure that we collect no more than is necessary to provide Duolingo’s services; (3) obtain parental consent before collecting personal data from children; and (4) allow parents to request that Duolingo change or delete personal data about their children.</p><h4>Children outside of the European Union</h4><p>If a child of under 13 years from outside the EU registers for the Duolingo service, upon registration the child will provide an adult’s e-mail address, to whom Duolingo sends a notification.</p><p>These child users will receive the following service restrictions:</p><ul><li>Instead of any Personally Identifiable Information about the child, we will only store the e-mail address of their parent/guardian.</li><li>Only family friendly advertisements are shown and these ads do not do behavioral tracking.</li><li>Mature words such as "beer" and "wine" are disabled.</li><li>Social features are disabled, e.g. profiles, forums, clubs, etc.</li><li>They can not enter profile information such as a profile picture or a bio.</li></ul><p>At the point when the user is known to have reached the age of 13, the account will automatically be transitioned to be a normal non-restricted account.</p><p><!-- react-text: 353 -->At all times Duolingo does not knowingly collect personal information from children in connection with the Service.
