</br>
<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data shall have the right to require the controller to immediately delete the personal data concerning him, provided that one of the following reasons is satisfied and the processing is not required:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The personal data has been collected for such purposes or otherwise processed for which they are no longer necessary.</li>
	<li>The data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing was based the data controller lacks any other legal basis for the processing.</li>

	<li>Processing is unlawful, the data subject refuses to delete the personal data and instead requests the restriction of the use of personal data.</li>
	<li>The controller no longer needs the personal data for processing purposes, but the data subject needs them to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.</li>
	<li>The data subject has objected to the processing and it is not yet clear whether the legitimate reasons of the person responsible outweigh those of the data subject.</li>
</ul>

<p>If one of the above conditions is met and an affected person wishes to request the restriction of personal data stored by us, they may at any time contact our data protection officer or another employee of the controller.

It also has the right to transfer this data to another person responsible, without hindrance by the controller, to whom the personal data was provided, provided that the processing is based on the consent or on a contract and processing by means of automated processes, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task of public interest or in the exercise of public authority, which has been assigned to the responsible person.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in exercising their right to data portability, the data subject has the right to obtain that the personal data are transmitted directly from one controller to another, insofar as this is technically feasible and if so this does not affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

</br>
<p>4.7. Right to Object</p>
</br>
<p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right, for reasons arising from its particular situation, against the processing of personal data relating to it. </p>

<p>If we process personal data in order to operate direct mail, the data subject has the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data for the purposes of such advertising. This also applies to the profiling, as far as it is associated with such direct mail. If the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, we will no longer process the personal data for these purposes.</p>
<p>In addition, the data subject has the right, for reasons that arise from their particular situation, against the processing of personal data relating to them, which we carry out for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, to object, unless such processing is necessary to fulfill a public interest task.</p>

<p>In order to exercise the right to object, the data subject can directly contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a>, or write to us at the address given at the end of this Policy. The data subject is also free, in the context of the use of information society services, to exercise his right of opposition by means of automated procedures using technical specifications.</p>
</br>
<p>4.8  Automated Decisions in Individual Cases Including Profiling</p>
</br>
<p>Any person concerned by the processing of personal data shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which has a legal effect on it or, in a similar manner, significantly affects it; unless the decision (1) is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller, or (2) is permitted by Union or Member State legislation to which the controller is subject, and that legislation provides for appropriate measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms as well as the legitimate interests of the data subject; or (3) with the express consent of the data subject.</p>

<p>If the decision (1) is required for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or (2) it is done with the express consent of the data subject, we shall take appropriate measures to safeguard the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject person, including at least the right to obtain the intervention of a person by the controller, to express his / her own position and to contest the decision.</p>

<p>If the data subject wishes to enforce automated decision-making rights, they may contact our data protection officer or other data controller at any time.</p>
</br>
<p>4.9  Right to Revoke Consent</p>
</br>
<p>Any person affected by the processing of personal data has the right, granted by the European directive and regulatory authority, to revoke consent to the processing of personal data at any time.</p>

<p>If the data subject wishes to assert their right to withdraw consent, they may at any time contact contact us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a>, or write to us at the address given at the end of this Policy.</p>

</br>
<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website or you request a service from a third party, our Policy no longer applies. Your browsing and interaction on any other website or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website’s or third party service provider’s own rules and policies. We do not monitor, control, or endorse the Information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Policy applies solely to Information collected by us through our website or services and does not apply to these third party websites and third party service providers.</p>
</br>
<h3 id="section-10">10. Where we store your information</h3>
</br>

<p>We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your Information so as to prevent unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal Information to comply with the same. However, unfortunately, the transmission of Information via the Internet is not completely secure. So, we cannot ensure the security of your Information transmitted by you to us via the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk and you acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of your Information, except to the extent we are required to accept such responsibility by the GDPR. Once we have received your Information we will use security procedures and features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>

Please email us at <a href="mailto:datacontroller@motorsport.com">datacontroller@motorsport.com</a> and we will respond to you as soon as possible.  This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue.
