We automatically analyze and aggregate frequently used search terms to improve the accuracy and relevance of suggested topics that auto-populate when you use the search feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some cases, we apply these learnings across our Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with some users before rolling the feature out to all users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>To communicate with you about the Services</strong></em>: We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp; We send you email notifications when you or others interact with you on the Services, for example, when you are&nbsp;@mentioned on a page or ticket or when a task if assigned to you.&nbsp;We also provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions with us.&nbsp; For example, certain actions you take in the Services may automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp; We also send you communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp; These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out&nbsp;of them.&nbsp; If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your account settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>To market, promote and drive engagement with the Services: </strong></em>We use your contact information and information about how you use the Services to send promotional communications that may be of specific interest to you, including by email and by displaying Atlassian ads on other companies&#39;

We also communicate with you about new product offers, promotions and contests.&nbsp; You can control whether you receive these communications as described below under &quot;Opt-out of communications.&quot;</p> <p><em><strong>Customer support</strong></em>:&nbsp;We use your information to resolve technical issues you encounter, to respond to your requests for assistance, to analyze crash information, and to repair and improve the Services.</p> <p><em><strong>For safety and security</strong></em>:&nbsp;We use information about you and your Service use to verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations&nbsp;of Service policies.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>To protect our legitimate business interests and legal rights</em>:</strong>&nbsp;Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and&nbsp;disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>With your&nbsp;consent</strong></em>: We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp;

Where we are using your information because we or a third party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no longer using the Services.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="how-we-share-information-we-collect">How we share information we collect</h2> <p>We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you.&nbsp; This means sharing information through the Services and with certain third parties.&nbsp; We share information we collect about you in the ways discussed below,&nbsp;including in connection with possible business transfers, but&nbsp;we are not in the business of selling&nbsp;information about you to advertisers or other third parties.</p> <p><strong>Sharing with other Service users&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>When you use the Services, we share certain information about you with other Service users.</p> <p><em><strong>For collaboration</strong></em>: You can create content, which may contain information about you, and grant permission to others to see, share, edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your administrator&nbsp;(if applicable) select.&nbsp; Some of the collaboration features of the Services display some or all of your profile information to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you comment&nbsp;on a Confluence page or Jira issue, we display your profile picture and name next to your comments so that other users with access to the page or issue understand who made the comment.&nbsp; When you send a Stride message to another user, the recipient can view any information&nbsp;in your profile card. Similarly, when you publish a Confluence page, your name is displayed as the author of that page, and Service users with permission to view the page can view your profile information as well.&nbsp; Please be aware that some aspects of the Services like Confluence pages or Bitbucket repositories can be made publicly available, meaning any content posted, including information about you, can be publicly viewed and indexed by and returned in search results of search engines.&nbsp; You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p> <p><em><strong>Managed accounts&nbsp;and administrators</strong></em>:&nbsp;If you register or access the Services using an email address with a domain that is owned by your employer or organization, and such organization wishes to establish an account or site, certain information about you including your name, profile picture, contact info, content and past use of your account may become accessible to that organization&rsquo;s administrator and other Service users sharing the same domain.&nbsp; If you are an administrator for a particular site or group of users within the Services, we may share your contact information with current or past Service users, for the purpose of facilitating Service-related requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Community Forums</strong></em>:&nbsp; Our websites offer&nbsp;publicly accessible blogs, forums, issue trackers, and wikis like&nbsp;<a href="https://community.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Community</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://community.developer.atlassian.com/">Atlassian Developer Community</a>.&nbsp;You should be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including profile information associated with the account you use to post the information - may be read, collected, and used by any member of the public who accesses these websites.&nbsp; Your posts and certain profile information may remain even after you terminate your account.&nbsp;We urge you to consider the sensitivity of any information you input into these Services.&nbsp;To request removal of your information from publicly accessible websites operated by us, please contact us as provided below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we&nbsp;will&nbsp;let you know if we are unable to and why.</p> <p><strong>Sharing with third parties</strong></p> <p>We share information with third parties that help us&nbsp;operate, provide, improve, integrate, customize, support and market our Services.</p> <p><em><strong>Service Providers</strong></em>: We&nbsp;work with third-party service providers&nbsp;to provide website and application development, hosting, maintenance, backup, storage, virtual infrastructure, payment processing, analysis and other services for us, which may require them to&nbsp;access or use information about you.&nbsp; If a service provider needs to&nbsp;access information about you to perform services on our behalf, they do so under close instruction from us, including policies and procedures designed to protect your information.</p> <p><em><strong>Atlassian Partners</strong></em>: We work with third parties who provide consulting, sales, and technical services to deliver and implement customer solutions around the Services. We may share your information with these third parties in connection with their services, such as to assist with billing and collections, to provide localized support, and to provide customizations.&nbsp; We may also share information with these third parties where you have agreed to that sharing.</p> <p><em><strong>Third Party Apps</strong></em>: You, your administrator or other Service users may choose to&nbsp;add new functionality or change the behavior of the Services by installing third party apps within the Services.&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing so may give third-party apps access to your account and information about you like&nbsp;your name and email address,&nbsp;and any content you choose to use in connection with those apps.&nbsp; If you are a technical or billing contact listed on an account, we share your details with the third-party app provider upon installation.&nbsp;Third-party app policies and procedures are not controlled by us, and this privacy policy does not cover how third-party apps use your information. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of third parties before connecting to or using their applications or services to learn more about their privacy and information handling practices.&nbsp;If you object to information about you being shared with these third parties, please uninstall the app.</p> <p><em><strong>Links to Third Party Sites</strong></em>: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. If you submit information to any of those third party sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies, not this one. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p> <p><em><strong>Social Media Widgets</strong></em>: The Services may include links that direct you to other websites or services whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your use of and any information you submit to any of those third-party sites is governed by their privacy policies, not this one.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Third-Party Widgets</strong></em>: Some of our Services contain widgets and social media features, such as the Twitter &quot;tweet&quot; button. These widgets and features collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Services, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Widgets and social media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p> <p><em><strong>With your consent</strong></em>: We share information about you with third parties when you give us consent to do so.&nbsp; For example, we often display personal testimonials of satisfied customers on our public websites. With your consent, we may post your name alongside the testimonial.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Compliance with Enforcement Requests and Applicable Laws; Enforcement of Our Rights</strong></em>: In exceptional circumstances, we may share information about you with a third party if we believe that sharing is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request,&nbsp;including to meet national security requirements, (b) enforce our agreements, policies and terms of service, (c) protect the security or integrity of our&nbsp;products and services, (d) protect Atlassian, our customers or the public from harm or illegal activities, or (e) respond to an emergency which we believe in good faith requires us to disclose information to assist in preventing the death or serious bodily injury of any person. For more information on how we respond to government requests, see our <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/guidelines-for-law-enforcement">Guidelines for Law Enforcement</a> and our <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/trust/privacy/transparency-report">Transparency Report</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sharing with affiliated companies</strong></p> <p>We share information we collect with affiliated companies and, in some cases, with prospective affiliates.&nbsp; Affiliated companies are companies owned or operated by us.&nbsp; The protections of this privacy policy apply to the information we share in these circumstances.</p> <p><em><strong>Atlassian companies</strong></em>:&nbsp;We share information we have about you with other Atlassian corporate affiliates in order to operate and improve products and services and to offer other Atlassian affiliated services to you.&nbsp;This includes companies that own or operate the services <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/legal/privacy-policy/product-family">listed here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Business Transfers</strong></em>: We may share or transfer information we collect under this privacy policy in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

We strongly recommend that server or data center users configure SSL to prevent interception of data transmitted over networks and to restrict access to the databases and other storage points used.</p> <p><strong>How long we keep information</strong></p> <p>How long we keep information we collect about you depends on the type of information, as described in further detail below.&nbsp; After such time, we will either delete or anonymize your information or, if this is not possible (for example, because the information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your information and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Account information</strong></em>: We&nbsp;retain your account information for as long as your account is active and a reasonable period thereafter in case you decide to re-activate the Services.&nbsp; We also retain some of your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, to resolve disputes, to enforce our agreements, to support business operations, and to continue to develop and improve our Services. Where we retain information for Service improvement and development, we take steps to eliminate information that directly identifies you, and we only use the information&nbsp;to uncover collective insights about the use of our Services, not to specifically analyze personal characteristics about you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Information you share on the Services</strong></em>: If your account is deactivated or disabled, some of your information and the content you have provided will remain in order to allow your team members or other users to make full use of the Services.&nbsp; For example, we continue to display messages you sent to the users that received them and continue to display content you provided.&nbsp;</p> <p><em><strong>Managed&nbsp;accounts</strong></em>: If the Services are made available to you through an organization (e.g., your employer), we retain your information as long as required by the administrator of your account.&nbsp; For more information, see &quot;Managed accounts and administrators&quot; above.</p> <p><em><strong>Marketing&nbsp;information</strong></em>: If you have elected to receive marketing emails from us, we retain information about your marketing preferences for a reasonable period of time from the date you last expressed interest in our Services, such as when you last opened an email from us or ceased using your Atlassian account.&nbsp; We retain information derived from cookies and other tracking technologies for a reasonable period of time from the date such information was created.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h2 id="how-to-access-and-control-your-information">How to access and control your information</h2> <p>You have certain choices available to you when it comes to your information. Below is a summary of those choices, how to exercise them and any limitations.</p> <p><strong>Your Choices</strong>:&nbsp;</p> <p>You have the right to request a copy of your information, to object to our use of your information (including for marketing purposes), to request the deletion or restriction of your information, or to request your information in a structured, electronic format.&nbsp; Below, we describe the tools and processes for making these requests.&nbsp; You can exercise some of the choices by logging into the Services and using settings available within the Services or your account.&nbsp;Where the Services are administered for you by an administrator (see &quot;Notice to End Users&quot; below), you may need to contact your administrator to assist with your requests first.&nbsp;&nbsp;For all other requests, you may contact us as provided in the Contact Us section below&nbsp;to request assistance.</p> <p>Your request and choices may be limited in certain cases: for example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about another person, or if you ask to delete information which we or your administrator are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate interests to keep.&nbsp; Where you have asked us to share data with third parties, for example, by installing third-party apps, you will need to contact those third-party service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.&nbsp; If you have unresolved concerns, you may have the right to complain to a data protection authority in the country where you live, where you work or where you feel your rights were infringed.</p> <p><em><strong>Access and update your information</strong></em>:&nbsp;Our Services and <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/alldoc/atlassian-documentation-32243719.html">related documentation</a>&nbsp;give you the ability&nbsp;to&nbsp;access and update certain information about you from within the Service. For example, you can access your profile information from your account and search for content containing information about you using key word searches in the Service.&nbsp; You can update your profile information within your profile settings and modify content that contains information about you using the editing tools associated with that content.</p> <p><em><strong>Deactivate your&nbsp;account</strong></em>:&nbsp;&nbsp;If you no longer wish to use our Services, you or your administrator may be able to deactivate your Services account.
