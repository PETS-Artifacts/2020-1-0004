							is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and
							that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. But the Company does not
							recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining
							exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to
							responding to DNT. For more information, visit <a href="//www.allaboutdnt.com">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.
						<h2>10.	Your California Privacy Rights</h2>

							Further, if you are a California resident and would like to opt out from the disclosure of
							your personal information to any third party for marketing purposes, please send an email to
							<a href="mailto:privacy@extremetube.com">privacy@extremetube.com</a>.
							Please be advised that if you opt out from permitting your personal information to be shared,
							you may still receive selected offers directly from the Company in accordance with
							California law.
						</p>
						<h2>11.	Links to Other Websites</h2>
						<p>The Website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that the Company is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of those other websites.
