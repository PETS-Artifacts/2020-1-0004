					<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>This privacy policy forms part of Switcher.ie&#39;s terms and conditions. Once you have provided your personal details on this website you will be deemed to have read and accepted this privacy policy.</p>

<p>Switcher.ie is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect about you to process your switch and to inform you about other services we provide.</p>

<p>The site is operated by Forward Internet Ireland Limited; a company incorporated in the Republic of Ireland (registration number 484948), the registered office of which is 3rd Floor, Kilmore House, Park Lane, Spencer Dock, Dublin 1 ("Switcher.ie"). Switcher.ie complies with all applicable Irish Data Protection legislation currently in force in relation to its treatment of personal information.</p>

<p>This privacy statement sets out the policy in relation to how any personal information collected from you through your use of this site is used.</p>

<h3>What personal information do we collect</h3>

<p>If you have requested to switch suppliers, we will use your personal information to process that switch. This will include passing your information to the new supplier.</p>

<p>Switcher.ie may disclose and use personal information collected about you within its own organisation (including its representatives) for the purpose of internal business administration, analysis and marketing.</p>

<p>Switcher.ie may also disclose personal information collected about you to third parties, for the purposes of completing any transaction you are undertaking with us, for providing any goods or services to you or for the purposes of associated administration or obtaining professional advice.</p>

<p>If you enter a contest or another promotion, we will use the data so that we can administer the contest and notify winners.</p>

<p>If you have requested to be kept informed of services that we offer, we will contact you with these details.</p>

<p>If during your visit to one of our insurance or energy calculators, you elected to continue by accepting the terms of our Privacy Policy, we may pass the details you submitted to our quote engine on to one of our representatives.</p>

<p>By indicating that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to allow Switcher to pass on your personal data to the relevant supplier.</p>

<p>If you provide us with your information through this website, for instance by filling in one of the forms requesting us to compare insurance quotes, we shall use your information as set out in this privacy policy and in the notices we provide when you submit your information.</p>

<p>By submitting your personal information, you consent to our use of the information as set out in this privacy policy and such notices.</p>

<p>In particular, we may need to collect your sensitive personal information to allow us to provide you with quotes, for instance information relating to criminal convictions or to your health. You consent to our use of such information for the purposes set out below.</p>

<p>If you give us your personal information, we will use it to provide you with the quote comparison information you request.</p>

<p>When completing a car or home insurance comparison, Switcher.ie may use the information you supply to contact you by phone, email, SMS or otherwise about products and services which may be of interest to you. Such services could include our newsletter, exclusive offers or renewal reminders.</p>

<p>If you are not happy for your data to be used in this way, you can unsubscribe by: Click on the &lsquo;unsubscribe&rsquo; link provided on each marketing email we send to you, or email <a href="mailto:customerservice@switcher.ie">customerservice@switcher.ie</a> and ask to unsubscribe from future marketing materials.</p>

<p>Please remember that by opting out, we will not be able to contact you about products or services that may benefit you. After processing a quote, we may send you a summary of the prices received by either email or SMS. This is part of our automated service and is a condition of use of our website.</p>

<p>If necessary the supplier might contact you to discuss your insurance, broadband or energy quotes. Without clicking &#39;Continue&#39;, &#39;Find Suppliers&#39; or &lsquo;Compare Quotes&rsquo; you will be unable to complete the car insurance or energy quotation process.</p>

<p>If you request an Insurance quote comparison through our website, we will forward the personal information you submit to selected insurers, insurance brokers and other related third parties to enable us to obtain a quote for you.</p>

<p>The insurers may use your personal information for their own purposes, which may include contacting you by mail, telephone or email, and any use by these insurers will be subject to the insurer&#39;s own terms and conditions and/or privacy policies.</p>

<p>We cannot provide a quote comparison to you unless we are able to share your personal information in this way.</p>

<p>In the event that none of the companies we forward your information to are able to provide an online quotation, we may pass on your contact details to a small number of companies who may be able to provide an offline quotation according to your circumstances.</p>

<p>Also, we may share your personal information with other selected third parties that may contact you directly about their products or services. We shall give you an opportunity to choose not to share your information with such selected parties before you submit your personal information.</p>

<p>If while comparing loans with us you provide us with your phone number, name, address and postcode, we may pass these details - and the information you have submitted on the site - on to one of our loans brokers.</p>

<p>By entering this information you are agreeing for us to pass your personal data to our loans brokers and for them to contact you by phone or email to discuss your requirements.</p>

<p>They will only contact you in relation to this enquiry for a limited time after you have used our service. They will not use your details for any other purpose.</p>

<p>If during your visit to our business energy service, you elected to continue by accepting the terms of our Privacy Policy, we may pass the details you submitted into our web form onto one of our representatives.</p>

<p>By indicating you have read and understood this Privacy Policy you are agreeing for us to pass your personal data to one of these representatives and for them to contact you by phone or email to discuss your requirements and provide business energy quotations.</p>

<p>Without clicking &#39;continue&#39; you will be unable to complete the business energy web form process.</p>

<p>The representatives will only contact you in relation to this enquiry for a limited time after you have used our service. They will not use your details for any other purpose.</p>

<p>If during your visit to the energy calculator you opted in for our marketing and told us the month of your home insurance renewal you will be called by one of our representatives in order to help you with your home insurance enquiry.</p>

<p>We monitor traffic patterns and site usage. Under the Data Protection Act 1998 we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

<p>For these purposes we may send your information internationally, including to countries outside the European Economic Association. Other countries offer differing levels of protection for personal information, not all of which will be as high as the levels of protection offered in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

Upon request, we will provide you with a readable copy of data which we hold about you. If you ask us to delete, correct or amend that personal data we will do so within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>In the course of serving our advertisements to you, a unique third-party cookie may be placed or recognized on your browser. In addition, we use web beacons, provided by our third-party ad server, to help manage and optimise our online advertising.</p>

<p>These web beacons enable our ad server, on our behalf or on behalf of our agent, to recognize a browser&#39;s cookie when a browser visits this site, and to learn which banner ads bring users to our website.</p>

This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page, a site in the Google Display Network, or somewhere on Facebook.</p>

<p>Third-party vendors, including Google &amp; Facebook, use cookies to serve ads based on someone&rsquo;s past visits to the Switcher.ie website. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy, as well as Google &amp; Facebook privacy policies.</p>
