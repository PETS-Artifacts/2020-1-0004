                    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

                    <p>LanguageTool is a proofreading software. It works by sending the text to be checked to our servers over an
                        encrypted connection. This policy describes what kind of data we store.</p>

                    <p>The processing of personal data on this website is carried out in accordance with
                        the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the German Federal Data Protection Act,
                        Bundesdatenschutzgesetz (BDSG 2018).</p>

                    <p><a href="/legal/">Here's how you can contact us.</a></p>

                    <p>Note: If you don't want any information to be transferred, download the desktop version from
                        <a href="/">our homepage</a>. It works locally without internet access and thus doesn't transfer any data.

                    <p><b>Have you given us permission to use your data, e.g. by subscribing to the newsletter?
                            You can revoke this permission at any time as described below.</b></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We don't store the text that you submit for style and grammar checking on languagetool.org, with the following exceptions:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If you explicitly submit feedback, for example about false alarms or undetected errors, we store that feedback.</li>
                                <li>If you accept or explicitly ignore corrections or open examples for an error, we log the internal rule id of that error
                                    (this is something like <tt>ENGLISH_WORD_REPEAT_RULE</tt> for word repetition errors).</li>
                                <li>If you accept a correction of a spelling error, we log the original word and the correction you selected.</li>
                                <li>In case of an internal software error (which is extremely rare), we log the sentence that caused the error so
                                    we can reproduce and fix the error.</li>
                            </ul>
                            In any case, we don't store the data with your IP address or any other meta information
                            that would allow us to identify you. Thus it's also not possible to delete your data.
                        </li>
                        <li>To improve our proofreading service, we keep a log of the following information:
                            <ul>
                                <li>date and time, length of submitted text, text language, processing time on server, number of detected errors (but not the actual errors unless you have agreed to that),</li>
                                <li>the page on which you submitted the request (referrer, e.g. languagetool.org),</li>
                                <li>internal errors that occur (e.g. the browser add-on not being able to access the text to be checked),</li>
                                <li>only for the browser add-on: add-on version; date of installation; random id of the text field that is being checked
                                <li>only transferred when you uninstall the browser add-on: the number of times you used the add-on
                                    and the URL of the page where the add-on was last used</li>
                            </ul>
                            None of this information can be used to identify you.
                        </li>
                        <!--<li>If you enter data in a contact form, this data will be transferred via email and it will be stored.</li>-->
                        <li>In our web server log files, your IP address is stored in an abbreviated form (like <tt>192.168.xxx.xxx</tt>)
                            so it cannot be used to identify you. Error messages like for exceeding the query limit are stored with the
                            full IP for up to 48 hours so we can prevent misuse of the service.</li>

                            <p>We deliver advertising with the help of Yieldlove GmbH, Kehrwieder 9, 20457 Hamburg.
                            The following information refers to this.

                            <h3>COOKIES</h3>

                            <p>What are cookies?
                            <p>Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the browser of the 
                                user. If the corresponding Internet page is retrieved, the browser of the user sends back the 
                                content of the cookies and thus enables recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically 
                                deleted after the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored 
                                for a predetermined time or permanently in the user's browser and then delete 
                                themselves (so-called temporary or permanent cookies)


                            <p>What data is stored in the cookies?
                            <p>In cookies, no personal data is stored, but only an online identifier.

                            <p>How can you prevent the use of cookies or delete cookies?
                            <p>You can deactivate the storage of cookies via your browser settings and delete already stored cookies at any time in your browser (see the section "Technical notes"). Please note, however, that this online offering without cookies may not work or may only work to a limited extent.

                            <p>Please note, furthermore, that contradictions against the creation of usage profiles partly work through
                                a so-called "opt-out cookie". If you delete all cookies, a contradiction may therefore no longer 
                                be taken into account and must be collected again by you.

                            <p>What cookies does yieldlove use?

                            <p><b>Analysis cookies</b><br>
                                yieldlove uses analysis cookies in order to be able to record the usage behavior (eg clicked advertising banners,
                                visited sub-pages, made search queries) of our users and to evaluate them in statistical form.

                            <p><b>Advertising cookies</b><br>
                                yieldlove also uses cookies for promotional purposes. Usage profiles created using these cookies (eg, clicked 
                                banner ads, visited subpages, requested search queries) are used by us to show you advertisements or offers 
                                that are tailored to your interests ("interest-based advertising").

                            <p><b>Advertising cookies of third parties</b><br>
                                yieldlove also allows other companies to collect our users' data through advertising cookies.
                                This allows yieldlove and third parties to provide users of our online service with interest-based 
                                advertising based on an analysis of their usage behavior (eg, clicked banner ads, visited 
                                subpages, requested search queries), and not limited to our online offerings.


                            <p>Yieldlove delivers advertising banners on behalf of its customers. All our banners use cookies. yieldlove places
                                these banners on third-party websites, such as a news page or languagetool.org, with the help of third-party providers.

                            <p>For diagnostic purposes, troubleshooting, and detecting fraudulent behavior, yieldlove collects user information 
                                in cookies using yieldlove's 6-month lifecycle. The captured user information includes user agent, 
                                device, HTTP referrer and the IP. This data is not retained for more than 7 days.

                            <p>Yieldlove takes reasonable steps to protect any information yieldlove processs from misuse, loss,
                                unauthorized access, modification or notification. yieldlove takes physical, electronic and procedural 
                                security measures to protect the data yieldlove processes. By doing so, yieldlove restricts access to this 
                                information to authorized employees.

                            <p>For the cookies that our third-party advertisers place for advertising purposes, yieldlove refers to 
                                the disclaimers that they have provided on the topic on their own websites. Note that
                                yieldlove can only refer to these disclaimers, as they change regularly and Yieldlove has no control over them.
