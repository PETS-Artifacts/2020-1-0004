<div id="your-rights"></div>
<br /><br /><h2>Your Rights</h2>
<p>Under the General Data Protection Regulation, you, as a data subject have a number of rights which are detailed below. Some of these only apply in specific circumstances and are qualified in several respects by exemptions in data protection legislation. We will advise you in our response to your request if we are relying on any such exemptions, however, some of the rights are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.</p>
<p><b>Access to personal data:</b> We provide the tools online for you to login to your account at any time to view and access your personal data. You have a right to request a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. If you wish to make such a request, please use our <a href="https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/contact-us/">contact us</a> page and select the "Data Controller" option from the list. You should include details of what information you require, adequate information to identify yourself and such other relevant information that will reasonably assist us in fulfilling your request. </p>
<p><b>Correction of personal data:</b> We provide the tools online for you to login to your account at any time to view, update and change any information about yourself if it is incorrect or outdated.</p>
<p><b>Right to withdraw consent:</b> Where we have relied upon your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent. For example to opt out of receiving newsletters, you can login to your account and edit your personal information and preferences. You can also limit what information we publish on our website by changing your settings on your account page, or <a href="https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/contact-us/">contacting us</a> to request your account is closed.</p>
<p><b>Right of erasure:</b> You can contact us to request us to erase your personal data where there is no compelling reason for us to continue processing. This right only applies in certain circumstances, it is not a guaranteed or absolute right as we may have legitimate reasons to retain your data as described above.</p>
<p><b>Closing your account:</b> If you wish for your Pets4Homes account to be closed, you can contact us via the <a href="https://www.pets4homes.co.uk/contact-us/">contact us</a> page. Please note that closing your account will remove any visible data from the internet such as old adverts and your profile page, and also prevent you from logging in. However, please note that this will not erase your data as we may have legitimate reasons to retain your data as described above.</p>
<p><b>Right to restrict processing:</b> In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing, pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.</p>
<p><b>Right to object to processing:</b> You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process your personal data for this purpose.</p>
<p><b>Right to data portability:</b> You have the right to have your parsonal data that we store and/or process sent to other data controllers and/or processors.</p>
<p><b>Right to complain to a supervisory authority:</b> If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, and you believe we haven't resolved the issue, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.</p>
