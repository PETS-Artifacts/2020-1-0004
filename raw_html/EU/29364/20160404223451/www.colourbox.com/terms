Such subject matter may be subject to copyrights, trademarks, property rights, privacy rights or other rights of third parties, and the Licensee is solely responsible for determining whether an approval from third parties is necessary, and if so, for obtaining such approval.</p><p>10.2 If a third party objects to the Licensee’s use of Materials, the Licensee shall give written notice to Colourbox immediately. In case of a legitimate objection, Colourbox shall at its sole discretion and as the Licensee’s sole remedy, either provide the Licensee with a replacement of the Materials in question, or terminate the Agreement against repayment of the fee already paid by the Licensee. The Licensee may not assert any other rights or make any other claims under this limited warranty.</p><p>10.3 Besides this limited warranty the Products are licensed “as is” and Colourbox makes no other guarantee, expressed or implied, regarding the Products, the Website or the Materials, including any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.</p><h4>11 Limitation of Liability</h4><p>11.1 Colourbox shall not be liable for any damages or economic loss, including but not limited to operating loss, loss of profits, loss of data, loss of materials or any other indirect economic loss suffered as a result of use of the Products, the Materials or the Website.
