<h1 class="privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="mainstory"><div></div><div><p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">Privacy Policy Declaration -- Updated: May 15, 2018</span></p></div><div><p>Creative COW LLC (hereafter known as Creative COW) has always worked hard to protect your personal data and we take your privacy very seriously.<br /><br />In the spirit of full disclosure and transparency, this Privacy Policy outlines our data collection and processing activities, as well as our efforts to protect your data. Our overriding policy is explained below but is encapsulated in the following bullet-points:<ul><li> We never sell your personal data to anyone. If you sign up for one of our newsletters, we will be the one sending them and your account information remains only with us, not any third-party advertiser.</li><li> We handle all our data processing in compliance with European privacy laws.</li><li> You are in control of your personal information at all times.</li></ul></p></div><div><p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">1. WHAT DATA IS COLLECTED, PROCESSED AND USED BY CREATIVE COW?<br /></span><p></p><strong>Non-Member Anonymous Vistors:</strong> To visit or to read content at Creative COW, you are <u><strong>not</strong></u> required to state who you are or provide any personal data whatsoever. You are free to read our forum posts, read or watch tutorials, view reels, look at the Job Board, read blogs, and do most every other activity in the Creative COW website. Our site is unlocked for anonymous visitors and you are welcome here. The only tracking being done on anonymous visitors is by Google Analytics (more information on that in point six below) which helps us view an aggregate of all our visitors so that we can see which articles people think are great and which ones we missed the mark on, for example. These kinds of aggregate analytics help us best focus our time and efforts but it is not done to compile visitor profiles, per se, and <em><strong>if you wish to exempt yourself from even this degree of non-personalized aggregate data tracking, you can do so by following the instructions given in point number six below.</strong></em></p></div>
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>We Use Cookies To Provide Added Functionality</strong> during your visits but you are under no obligation to leave them activated and you are free to turn them off in your browser. Our cookies are not tracking you and they are not designed to build or facilitate constructing a user profile of who you are or what you do in Creative COW. Our cookies are there to aid in speeding your use of the website and allowing a smoother and more full featured use of our site. If you leave our cookies active, they will remember you only to the degree that they will help you surf our site faster and have access to all the features of our interface -- but even that information is resident in the cookies on your local machine, not on our website. Our cookies are not "reporting back" to Creative COW in the sense of constructing user profiles, etc. Turning off the cookies, severs any and all connection that you have with our site. We do not recommend this as we cannot guarantee how the site will function in your browser under those conditions.</p></div>
            
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>Becoming A Full Posting Member of Our Community:</strong> It is our policy to require a real name registration only if you wish to post in our forums, adding your own questions or other interactions to the boards. We ask for real names to keep people responsible for their words and to keep flame wars, etc., at bay. There is a reason that our site has not self-destructed in the almost 20 years of its existence and we believe that having people responsible for their words is the biggest factor in this site's success. <em>Registration requirements are limited to your name and an email address that you must verify to activate your membership account.</em> Even at this point we are not tracking you and as with the preceeding anonymous accounts outlined above, the only tracking being done is by Google Analytics which helps us view things in aggregate so we can see which articles people think are great and which ones we missed the mark on, for example. These kinds of aggregate analytics help us best focus our time and efforts but it is not done to compile member profiles, per se, and if you wish to exempt yourself from even this degree of non-personalized aggregate data tracking, you can do so by using following the instructions given in point number six below.</p></div>
            
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>Areas Where Our Members May Elect To Voluntarily Expand What They Reveal About Themselves:</strong> There are areas of Creative COW that offer expanded member services for those who wish to take advantage of them. They include areas like our Services Offered section which helps promote their services to other members in the hope that they get work for themselves or their company. This necessitates additional information to be volunteered: this may or may not include your company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, e-mail addresses (see note just below regarding our efforts to protect your email address even in the Services section) or other contact data; it might also include information on products you use and skills you posess, your personal or company website, tools and configuration and other product-related data, as well as references to other identification particulars and details, including user profiles and scope of expertise. This expanded information beyond the basic name and email required to establish a user account with Creative COW, is strictly voluntary and no member is under any obligation to volunteer information. It can be deleted at any time by request. We are currently working on the means to give our members direct access to allow you to remove Service Offered listings directly and immediately, if you so wish.</p></div>
            
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>Email Addresses In Creative COW:</strong> We <u>never</u> make nor do we encourage our member email addresses to be made public. If you ever see any email addresses in a forums post or in a blog, etc., at Creative COW, the user in question has volunteered the information, as we do not in any area of our site encourage users to make their emails public. <em>Even if a member chooses to use our Services Offered section to promote their business, we use a system that converts their email address to a graphic so that spam web crawlers are at a disadvantage to harvest the information.</em></p></div>
            
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>Furthermore, for technical reasons and to comply with legal requirements of proving we are working within the legal construct, data may be collected by our website when you register with us</strong>, such as the date and time of registration, the IP of the referring website, the authorization date, ID code and log-in, which validate your membership and prove it was a legal request. (The data mentioned above is hereafter collectively referred to as personal data.) This data is not used to create ever-growing user profiles based on every click and visit, as is the case in some social networks.) We do not work nor do we have systems in place that are designed to watch our members.</p></div>
            
            <div class="mainstory"><div><p><strong>Our members may cancel their memberships and remove themselves from our system completely, at any time. Doing so will wipe out all trace of your account, as if you were never a member of Creative COW.</strong></p></div>
            
                <div><p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">2. USE AND DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA<br /></span><br />Creative COW may collect, process and use your personal data to:</p></div><div><ul class="bluebullets"><li>fulfill its obligations under the member agreements between you and Creative COW;</li><li>provide assistance and service, including services in connection with the business operations of Creative COW, such as support on software or hardware issues;</li><li>obtain your opinion on Creative COW products and services and conduct product surveys;</li><li>simplify and process your search transactions and your requests for data and for the products and services of Creative COW;</li><li>provide you with the latest information on Creative COW products and services, including suggestions and special offers that you may be interested in;</li><li>improve Creative COW’s products and services for you;</li><li>conduct competitions, contests and other promotional offers and marketing activities;</li><li>ensure that you are able to access this website by means of the interface provided by Creative COW for this purpose.</li></ul></div><div><p>Creative COW stores your personal data solely in order to fulfill the purpose for which it was originally collected or in order to comply with the provisions of applicable laws and regulations.<br /><br />Creative COW has never directly shared personal data with other Creative COW affiliated companies or advertisers in the USA, Europe or elsewhere in the world, personal data may be made available to them by advertising tracking technology resident within their advertising on our site. You may elect to use one of many ad blockers available online to protect your privacy. Search Google for "ad blockers" available for your computer system.<br /><br />It may be necessary for us to access your personal data or disclose your personal data in order to comply with the provisions of applicable laws or court proceedings or to assert our rights or defend ourselves against legal claims. We will disclose personal data and all other available information if necessary in order to investigate unlawful activities, suspected fraud, potential threats to the corporeal integrity of persons or violations of the conditions of use specified by Creative COW, or to take preventive measures or countermeasures in this regard. Data may additionally be conveyed for other reasons to the extent required or permitted by law.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold; "><br />3. HOW CREATIVE COW COLLECTS PERSONAL DATA<br /><br /></span>Creative COW collects data about you in various ways. For example, we request your contact data when you correspond with Creative COW, register with us to create a membership account, or register in order to join an online contest, gain peer-to-peer support, or sign up for materials available for downloading, including our member and third-party newsletters.</p><br /><a href="https://newsletters.creativecow.net/sponsors/2018/05-01/index.html"><img src="https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/advideo.creativecow.com/support/third-party-newsletter-notice.jpg" align="center"></a><br /></div><div><br /><br /><p>The most common examples of how Creative COW collects your personal data are:</p></div><div><ul class="bluebullets"><li>When you register at Creative COW, we collect your name, email address, and other contact data you may wish to volunteer beyond the basic name and email needed to officially open an account with us.</li><li>When you request help from our forums, we use cookies and javascripts to compile user profiles that our members can visit, so that our leaders and members can get to know one another better and hopefully help one another more effectively.</li></ul></div><div><p>Creative COW strives to respect the various preferences you have expressed at various times in order to process and manage your data appropriately. If you ever believe we have incorrect data for whatever reason, please contact Creative COW in order to correct the situation.<br /><span style="font-weight: bold; "><br />4. SECURITY OF COLLECTED PERSONAL DATA<br /></span><br />Creative COW takes due care to protect your personal data against loss and misuse. Creative COW strives to the best of its ability to take all suitable technical and organisational measures and precautionary measures in order to protect personal data against unauthorised access, improper use, changes, loss or destruction. These measures comprise:&nbsp;</p></div><div><ul class="bluebullets"><li>Restricting access to personal data. Only employees who need to know the data are allowed access.</li><li>Using physical, electronic and process-based security mechanisms conforming to regulations in order to protect your personal data.</li><li>Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption for the collection and transmission of all sensitive data, including posts in our forums, in our blogs, our Services Offered and Job Board sections, and any other area of our site which might otherwise compromise our member private data.</li><li>To guard your private data, we employ Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com company (NASDAQ: AMZN), as our backbone provider because of their industry-leading technical abilities in security and systems support. Our website and web-associated online services are hosted at AWS and you can learn more about them at <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" title="Amazon Web Services">https://aws.amazon.com</a>.</li></ul></div><div><p><span style="font-weight: bold; ">5.
