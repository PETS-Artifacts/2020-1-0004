<div class="hide">
<p><b>Security of Communications</b><br>Please be aware that communications over the Internet, such as e-mails and webmails, are not secure unless they have been encrypted. Your communications may route through a number of countries before being delivered - this is the nature of the World Wide Web/Internet. giffgaff cannot accept responsibility for any unauthorised access or loss of personal information that is beyond our control.</p>
<p><b>giffgaff Blogs, Chat rooms and Forums</b><br>You are reminded that chat rooms and opinion forums are for public discussion. Any personal information that you choose to supply when you participate in these discussions is widely accessible. Never reveal any personal information such as your telephone number, postal or email address when you participate in these discussions.</p>
<p><b>Users 13 and under</b><br>If you are aged 13 or under, please get your parent or guardian's permission before providing any personal information or before taking part in any www.giffgaff.com discussion. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information.</p>
<p><b>Co-Branded Micro Sites and Third Party Sites</b><br>Some web pages and Micro Websites included within giffgaff's websites may be co-branded with third party names, logos, or properties. These Micro Websites are operated or maintained by or on behalf of giffgaff. While such third parties are sponsors of these web pages or Micro Websites, the third parties do not share in any personally identifiable information collected within those web pages or Micro Websites unless otherwise stated.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to third party sites that you may access via our Portals. You should therefore ensure that you are familiar with the applicable third-party privacy policy before entering any personal information on a third party site.</p>
<p>This policy does not apply to third party sites operated by those promoting giffgaff, including Super Recruiters. Whilst giffgaff provides guidance to Super Recruiters in respect of their use and protection of personal data, giffgaff requires such third party sites to maintain a privacy policy. You should, therefore, review relevant policies to learn about how your personal data will be treated.</p>
<p><b>Non-EEA Use of Information</b><br>The information you provide to us may be passed to third parties located outside the European Economic Area. Countries outside the European Economic Area do not always have strong data protection laws. However, we will always take steps to ensure that your information is used by third parties in accordance with this policy. This can be done in a number of different ways, for instance:</p>
<ul><ul><li>The country that we send the data to might be approved by the European Commission;</li>
<li>The recipient company might have signed up to a contract obliging them to protect your information; or;</li>
<li>The recipient is located in the US and is a certified member of the EU-US Privacy Shield scheme.</li>
</ul></ul><p>In other circumstances the law may permit us to otherwise transfer your information outside the EEA. In all cases, however, we will ensure that any transfer of your information is compliant with data protection law.</p>

<h3 id="useofyourinformation">4. Use of your information</h3>
<p>As a general rule, we use your information so that we can better understand our members which enables us to provide you and other members with a better experience and better services. We use your information for the purposes set out below, which are categorised by the legal bases applicable to the purposes described:</p>
<ul><li>
<p>It is necessary for the <b>performance of the contract</b> with you or to take steps to enter into it. This includes verifying your identity, administering the agreement between us in accordance with our <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/terms#giffgaff-gameplan-tc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms and Conditions</a>, to provide you with the Services, including analysing and reporting on your account and transaction data that we obtain from your bank, managing your account, communicating with you (for example, sending you important service related messages), providing updates on the status of your account (for example, we may contact you to ask you to refresh your consent for us to access your bank account information when your current consent is due to expire or we may notify you to warn you that your giffgaff account will be closed due to non-use), dealing with any complaints and notifying you of any changes to this statement or our <a href="https://www.giffgaff.com/terms#giffgaff-gameplan-tc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>
<p>To provide you with the Service, we use analytics to personalise your member account based on your past bank transaction history. As a result, we&rsquo;ll make assumptions about what we believe to be your representative monthly income, your regular transactions and your typical variable monthly spend (broken down into a number of categories).</p>
</li>
<li>It is necessary for our <b>legitimate interests</b> or that of a third party. This includes:
<ul><li>verification of your identity by your bank to enable your bank to authenticate the connection between us and your bank account;</li>
<li>analysis of information about you including your calling, searching, browsing and location data on a personalised or aggregated basis to inform our marketing strategy and to enhance and personalise your experience;</li>
<li>verifying the accuracy of data that we hold about you and create a better understanding of you as a member;</li>
<li>aggregating information about you, your spending and your use of the Services with information about other users of the Services in order to identify trends (<b>"Aggregated Data"</b>). Aggregated Data will not contain information from which you may be personally identified;</li>
<li>analysis of your open banking data in order to improve our credit checking processes;</li>
<li>for statistical, analysis and system testing (including monitoring usage behaviour) in order to understand your needs and provide a better service to you, and to help us develop and improve our products and services;</li>
<li>network and information security in order for us to take steps to protect your information against loss or damage, theft or unauthorised access;</li>
<li>to comply with a request from you in connection with the exercise of your rights (for example where you have asked us not to contact you for marketing purposes, we will keep a record of this on our suppression lists in order to be able to comply with your request);</li>
<li>to assess and improve our service to members through recordings of any calls with our contact centres;</li>
<li>contacting you to ask you to participate in customer satisfaction surveys and market research (by email, letter, SMS or phone) and to undertake and analyse those surveys and research, this is to allow us to benchmark our services and evaluate new and existing products and services; and</li>
<li>management of queries, complaints, or claims.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>It is necessary for <b>compliance with a legal obligation</b>. This includes when you exercise your legal rights under data protection law, to verify your identity, for the establishment and defence of our legal rights, for activities relating to the prevention, detection and investigation of crime, and for compliance with our legal and regulatory responsibilities.</li>
<li>
<p>You have given us your <b>consent</b> to:</p>
<ul><li>contact you via email or text or &ldquo;push&rdquo; notification with marketing information about our goods and services, promotions and offers;</li>
<li>show you adverts that you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests, which helps us to customise your member experience; and</li>
<li>share your information with our recommended third party partners for them to contact you with marketing information about their products and services.</li>
</ul><p>You may withdraw your consent for us or any authorised third parties to use your information for marketing purposes at any time. Please see '<a href="#marketing">Marketing</a>' below for further information on how to unsubscribe.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>If you use any of our other services, we may associate any category of information with any other category of information that we hold about you and will treat the combined information as personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and our any of our other privacy policies applicable to the particular service for which we hold your information, for as long as it is combined.</p>
<p>In relation to our obligations under the Payment Services Directive (2015/2366) (PSD II), we will not:</p>
<ul><li>access any information about you other than information from your designated payment accounts for which you have given us your consent to access, and associated payment transactions;</li>
<li>request from your bank any sensitive payment data linked to your designated payment accounts that we have access to; or</li>

<p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="dataanonymisation">6. Data anonymisation and use of aggregated information</h3>
<p>Your information may be converted into statistical or aggregated data in such a way as to ensure that you are not identified or identifiable from it. Aggregated data cannot be linked back to you as a natural person. It might be used to conduct research and analysis, including to produce statistical research and reports. This aggregated data may be shared in several ways, including with our group companies.</p>
<p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="retentionofyourinformation">7. Retention of your information</h3>
<p>If we collect your personal information, the length of time we retain it is determined by a number of factors including the purpose for which we use that information and our obligations under other laws. We do not retain personal information in an identifiable format for longer than is necessary.</p>
<p>We may need your personal information to establish, bring or defend legal claims. For this purpose, we will always retain your personal information for 7 years after the date it is no longer needed by us for any of the purposes listed under section 4 &ldquo;Use of your information&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The only exceptions to this are where:</p>
<ul><li>the law requires us to hold your personal information for a longer period, or delete it sooner</li>
<li>you exercise your right to have the information erased (where it applies) and we do not need to hold it in connection with any of the reasons permitted or required under the law (see further Erasing your personal information or restricting its processing)</li>
<li>in limited cases, the law permits us to keep your personal information indefinitely provided we put certain protections in place.</li>
</ul><p>In relation to your bank account information, this is only retained by us in limited circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>If you do not renew your consent and you do not revoke it, your consent will have lapsed. In this instance we will retain your bank account information for a period of 9 months after your consent has lapsed, before your bank account information will be immediately and permanently removed from our systems or anonymised (in the event you do not renew your consent before the end of this nine month period).</li>
<li>If you revoke your consent/remove your bank account on a given date (see final paragraph of <a href="#useofyourinformation">section 4</a>), we will not retain your bank account information for any longer than the given date (i.e. your bank account information will be immediately and permanently removed from our systems at the point of your revocation).</li>
<li>Provided you continue to renew your consent we will retain your bank account information for a period of 7 years, so for example, if you have continued to provide consent for a seamless period of 8 years, we will only retain your bank account information for the last 7 of those 8 years.</li>
</ul><p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="transferstothirdcountries">8. Transfers to third countries/where we store your information</h3>
<p>We store your information on servers located within the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>Your information may be transferred to a country outside of the EEA by us or any of the third parties referred to above. Where adequate protections for your information do not exist under the applicable laws of that third country, we (or the party transferring your information) will take necessary steps to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place to maintain the same levels of protection as are needed under UK data protection legislation. Safeguards include imposing contractual obligations on the recipient of your information or subscription to &lsquo;international frameworks&rsquo; that ensure adequate protection. Please contact our DPO for more information about the protections that are in place.</p>
<p>If you use our Services whilst you are outside of the EEA, your information may be transferred outside of the EEA in order to provide you with the Services.</p>
<p>Please note that, as we use Google Analytics, Google may transfer your information outside of the EEA and we recommend that you read Google&rsquo;s privacy notice for further information. Google is registered with the Privacy Shield for transfers of personal data to the US.</p>
<p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="security">9. Security</h3>
<p>Where you have chosen a password that enables you to access the Services on our App and/or Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. We will put in place reasonable and appropriate controls to ensure that your information remains secure against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, or unauthorised access.</p>
<p>Our Website may contain links to other websites run by other organisations. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those other websites and apps&sbquo; so we encourage you to read their privacy statements. We cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of other websites and apps even if you access them using links that we provide. In addition, if you linked to our Website from a third party website, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies and practices of the owners and operators of that third party website and recommend that you check the policy of that third party website.</p>
<p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="marketing">10. Marketing</h3>
<p>When registering to receive the Services, we will ask you if you would like to give your consent to receive marketing information directly from us, and/or the third parties notified to you at the time of asking, for marketing purposes including, amongst other things, to identify and offer you further products, services and offers which we think might interest you.</p>
<p>We will only share your personal information with our recommended third party partners for them to contact you with marketing information about their products and services where you have indicated that you would like us to do so. Please use the link on the page requesting your consent to marketing to find out more about these third parties. Once shared, the relevant third party&rsquo;s privacy policy will apply to their processing of your personal information, not ours.

<p>You have the right to opt-out of our use of your personal information to send marketing to you. To withdraw your consent, please update your contact permissions in the &ldquo;My Profile and Settings&rdquo; section on your member dashboard. For e-mail marketing, you can click on the unsubscribe link in the relevant e-mail, and for push notifications sent to you via the App, you can switch these off by changing the settings on your mobile device. From time to time, we may ask you to refresh your marketing preferences by asking you to confirm that you consent to continue receiving marketing information from us.</p>
<p class="linktotop" style="text-align: right;">[<a href="#TopPrivacy">Top</a>]</p>

<li>to <b>restrict processing</b> of your information in certain circumstances including where you contest the accuracy of it, you have objected to it and we are assessing whether we can continue processing it for our legitimate interest or we no longer need your information but you ask us to keep it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim;</li>
<li>to have your information <b>erased</b> in certain circumstances including where it is no longer necessary for our purposes, you withdraw your consent or you object to the processing and we have no overriding legitimate interest to continue using it;</li>
<li>to <b>withdraw your consent</b> to our processing of your personal data where we&rsquo;ve relied on your consent;</li>
<li>to <b>request access</b> to your information and information about how we process it;</li>
