As a result of this agreement between the US and the European Commission, the latter has established an adequate level of data protection for companies certified under the Privacy Shield. Further, we have agreed the application ofÂ EU standard data protection clauses with other service providers based in a country outside the EU or the EEAÂ in order to provide suitable guarantees pursuant to art. 46 para. 2 lit. c GDPR.</p>
<p>All data collected in the context of the use of these web pages or in forms provided for the purposes as described below are processed on the servers of the respective service provider. Processing on other servers only takes place as described within this privacy statement.</p>
<h3 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-2.DatacollectionandusefortheuseofTrustedShopsproducts">2. Data collection and use for the use of Trusted Shops products</h3>
<p>We collect personal data if you voluntarily provide it when contacting us (e.g. via contact form or e-mail). Mandatory fields are marked as such, since in these cases we require the data for processing your contact or opening of the customer account in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR and you cannot send the contact without this information. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. We use the data provided by you to process your enquiries.</p>
<p>We have engaged service providers for the technical processing of your inquiries on our behalf. These service providers are based in the USA and are certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. As a result of this agreement between the US and the European Commission, the latter has established an adequate level of data protection for companies certified under the Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>After complete processing of the inquiry, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of the storage periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.</p>
<h4 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-LiveChatToolUserlike">Live Chat Tool Userlike</h4>
<p>If you use the live chat tool to make contact, the data you voluntarily enter there (name, e-mail address, message) will be stored on our behalf at our service provider Userlike on servers within Germany. They will be processed there for the purpose of answering the inquiry by us and subsequently deleted in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>
<h4 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-RegistrationforTrustedShopsbuyerprotection">Registration for Trusted Shops buyer protection</h4>
<p>When subscribing for Trusted Shops buyer protection, we need your e-mail address, theÂ <span>total purchase price, the selected payment method, purchase order number, your customer number (if you have one) and the name of the online shop from which you ordered the product.</span></p>
<p>Your data will be used within the scope of contract processing in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR for the purpose of providing the Trusted Shops buyer protection to you.</p>
<p>Only in the event of a claim under the buyer protection we require additional information and personal data from you to review and process your claim for reimbursement. When registering a refund claim, your name, address, telephone number and bank account will be charged for the refund.Â </p>
<p>With the buyer protection you also get access to the Trusted Shops customer login (My Trusted Shops). In the Trusted Shops customer login you can see your active and concluded buyer protection contracts, submit refund applications and submit or change ratings for your orders. Your e-mail address serves as identification and user name for access to My Trusted Shops. You have the possibility to personalize your membership account by voluntarily entering further personal data such as your name, place of residence and/or a profile picture in the Trusted Shops customer login or when submitting a rating.</p>
<p>Your submitted ratings can then be displayed with these additional details, although some details to protect your privacy are always only displayed in abridged form. Similarly, a summary of all assessments submitted can then be publicly retrieved. Your email address will not be publicly displayed. You can change or remove your personal data at any time in My Trusted Shops. You can also deactivate the public display of your profile there.</p>
<p>After complete processing of the contract or deactivation of your customer account, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of the storage periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration. You can deactivate your customer account at any time and either by sending a message to the contact option described below or using the function provided for this purpose in the customer account.</p>
<h4 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-Subscribingtoratingreminder">Subscribing to rating reminder</h4>
<p>If, during or after placing your order, you grant an express consent according to art. 6 par. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR to receiving email reminders, your email address will be transferred to Trusted Shops for the purpose of sending you email reminders about rating your purchase order using the Trusted Shops customer rating service.Â If you subscribe to the automated rating reminder service, you will be automatically receiving email reminders about rating a transaction after every purchase from the Trusted Shops members. On your every visit, you will be recognised based on anonymised data. You may withdraw your consent to receiving email reminders at any time, with effect on your future orders.Â </p>
<p>If you submit an evaluation via the Trusted Shops evaluation system, we require your e-mail address within the framework of our user contract in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPRÂ in order to ensure the validity and trustworthiness of the evaluation. The e-mail address will be stored for this purpose together with the order number and the evaluation submitted. When you submit a product review, the URL of the product and the product image, the product name, the product SKU, GTIN and MPN, and the manufacturer are also saved.</p>
<p>In order to make the rating system secure, to prevent incorrect or falsified ratings and to ensure proper operation of the rating system, we also collect your IP address when you submit a rating. This serves to safeguard our legitimate interests in the prevention of misuse and the protection of our systems that are overriding in the process of balancing of interests in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f GDPR. The IP address is stored for a maximum of 7 days for the evaluation and then deleted.</p>
<h4 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-SocialloginviaFacebookorGoogle">Social login via Facebook or Google</h4>

As a result of this agreement between the US and the European Commission, the latter has established an adequate level of data protection for companies certified under the Privacy Shield.</p>
<p>In case of a link between the accounts, you will only need to authenticate to Facebook or Google using your login information to be logged into your Trusted Shops customer account for buyers. For this purpose, you will be asked to consent to the transmission of the following data to Trusted Shops the first time you create a link:</p>
<p>Facebook: E-mail address, name, profile photo, age range (e.g. 35-39), language, country and other data that you have set to public on your Facebook profile.</p>
<p>Google: E-mail address, name, profile photo and other data that you have posted on your Google profile as publicly available.</p>
<p>The data Trusted Shops receives from Facebook or Google will be used to help you design your shopper profile on the basis of your consent pursuant to art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a GDPR. Facebook receives the e-mail address from Trusted Shops the first time it is linked in order to identify you as a user, and afterwards only the ID that has been set as an authentication feature for you between the two systems. Facebook or Google does not receive any further data. You can unlink the accounts at any time and revoke the transfer of data with future effect by changing your settings on Facebook (<a class="external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=applications" rel="nofollow">here</a>) or Google (<a class="external-link" href="https://myaccount.google.com/security#connectedapps" rel="nofollow">here</a>).</p>

<h3 id="DatenschutzerklÃ¤rungWebseitenEN-3.Datatransfer">3. Data transfer</h3>
<p>If you have ordered goods which we will send to you by post, we will pass on the data required for the fulfilment of the contract in accordance with art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPRÂ to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery if this is necessary for the delivery of ordered goods. Depending on which payment service provider you select in the order process, we pass on the payment data collected for the processing of payments to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to payment service providers commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there.
