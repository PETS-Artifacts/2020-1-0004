You can configure your browser for it to inform you whenever a page uses cookies and decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject the cookies on a given page or generally. Please note that disabling cookies may limit your access to some features of our website.</p>
<p>Below we present information on cookies we use and how you can customise your browser in that respect.</p>

As a rule, cookies of our partner providers are deleted a few days or up to 24 months later, or in some cases after several years.

<h3><a name="Contact_form"></a>Contact form</h3>
<p>Your personal data will be collected if you voluntarily supply them to us when contacting us or during the registration for our services. We use your data solely to be able to offer you the information and services you request, which means that we will store and process only the data and information that are absolutely necessary to respond to your enquiry or execute an agreement.</p>
<p>If you contact us but did not sign a membership agreement, we will delete your data from our customer database if you request us to.</p>
<h2><a name="Subscribing_to_newsletter"></a>Subscribing to the newsletter</h2>
<p>If you subscribe to one of our newsletters, we will use the data you supply with your express consent to send you our newsletter. You must provide your e-mail address, all other information is voluntary. The newsletter includes the latest posts and offers of Trusted Shops GmbH and third-party providers. You may cancel your subscription at any time.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to our newsletter, we will pass your data necessary for the sending of the newsletter to a service provider who will be commissioned to handle the mailing of the newsletters to subscribers.</p>
<h2><a name="Subscribing_for_warranty"></a>Subscribing for the Trusted Shops warranty</h2>
<p>To register you for the Trusted Shops warranty, we will need your email address, total purchase price, the selected payment method, purchase order number, your customer number (if you have one) and the name of the online shop from which you ordered the product.</p>
<p>Your data will be used to enable us to ensure that your purchase order comes with a warranty and to enable you to use the Trusted Shops system. With the Trusted Shops system you may view your active and expired warranties, request a refund and rate your purchase orders. In this process, your e-mail address is the username you use to sign in to the Trusted Shops system and will be permanently stored for this purpose.</p>
<p>Only if you want to make use of the warranty will we need additional information and personal data to check and process your request for a refund. In the process of registering your claim for a refund, we will collect your name, street address, telephone number, where appropriate, and your bank account number to make the refund. We will use these data solely for the purpose of handling your refund claim. After that, the data will be blocked from further use and finally deleted once all retention periods under commercial and tax law expire.</p>
<h2><a name="Subscribing_to_rating_reminder"></a>Subscribing to rating reminder</h2>
<p>If, during or after placing your order, you grant an express consent to receiving email reminders by ticking an appropriate checkbox or clicking an appropriate button (e.g. “Rate later”), your email address will be transferred to Trusted Shops so that we can send you email reminders about rating your purchase order using the Trusted Shops customer rating service. Other data that may be transferred includes shop URL, purchase order number and names and numbers of items you ordered, so that you can rate a transaction after finalisation, provided that the product rating feature is available for the ordered product. You may withdraw your consent to receiving email reminders at any time, with effect on your future orders.</p>
<p>If you subscribe to the automated rating reminder service, you will be automatically receiving email reminders about rating a transaction after every purchase from the Trusted Shops members.  On your every visit, you will be recognised based on anonymised data.  You may withdraw your consent to receiving email reminders at any time, with effect on your future orders.</p>
<h2><a name="Leaving_a_rating"></a>Leaving a rating</h2>
<p>If you leave a rating through the Trusted Shops rating system, without having previously made use of a Trusted Shops warranty, we will need your e-mail address to ensure that your rating is valid and reliable. The e-mail address will be used for the purpose of checking whether the person who leaves the rating is a customer of the online shop being rated and whether the rating can be verifiably attributed to a purchase order; to that end, the email address will be stored together with the purchase order number and the rating. If you rate a product, we will also store the names and numbers of the products ordered under your email address.</p>
<p>In addition, we will use your email address to enable you to use the Trusted Shops system. In the Trusted Shops system, you may view (and change, if needed) your other ratings of shops and/or products, view your active and expired warranties (as long as warranty agreements were concluded under that email address), claim refunds, if any, and rate the concluded transactions. In this process, your e-mail address is the username you use to sign in to the Trusted Shops system and will be permanently stored for this purpose.</p>
<p>In order to ensure security of the rating system, prevent false or incorrect ratings and enable smooth and proper operation of the rating system, we will also collect information about your IP address the moment you post your rating. It will be stored for up to 7 days in reference with the rating and then deleted.</p>
<h3><a name="Shopper_Profile"></a>Shopper Profile</h3>
<p>In addition, you may personalize your ratings by providing more detailed personal information when posting your rating or by entering more detailed personal information into the Trusted Shops system. Thus, we will be able to display your ratings with that additional information, whereas some of your information will be displayed only with some of its parts being masked to protect your privacy. The public will be able to view a summary of all your ratings left so far. Your email address will be never published, though. You may delete your personal data at any time; to that end, sign into the Trusted Shop system and clear the relevant fields. There, you may also make appropriate settings to hide your profile from the public view.</p>
<h2><a name="Membership_registration"></a>Membership registration</h2>
<p>Membership is offered exclusively to entities engaged in trading as part of their business activity or to self-employed persons. Your personal data will be collected if you voluntarily supply them to us when contacting us or during the registration for our services. We use your data solely to be able to offer you the information and services you request, which means that we will store and process only the data and information that are absolutely necessary to respond to your enquiry or execute an agreement.</p>
<p>When you contact us or request membership, we will prompt you to enter certain data, such as your e-mail address, your name, street address and the address of your online shop. On the relevant pages, you will be able to see what information must be necessarily provided and what information is voluntary. We need the information to be able to respond to your enquiry or check your membership request. If you are a member, you may request us to block your data from further processing after the membership agreement expires; your data will be deleted upon expiry of all retention periods prescribed by tax and commercial law. If you contact us but did not sign a membership agreement, we will delete your data from our customer database if you request us to.</p>
<h3><a name="Transmission_of_data"></a>Transmission of data to third parties as part of the membership registration process</h3>
<p>Only if you are an entity engaged in trading as part of your business activity or a self-employed person will we transfer your address details to credit bureaus during the process of concluding the membership agreement for the credit bureau to evaluate the liability risk and check your creditworthiness. Your creditworthiness and personal information will not be disclosed to any third parties unless you consent to a certain disclosure in a separate, express consent.</p>
<h2><a name="Apply_for_a_job"></a>Apply for a job at Trusted Shops</h2>
<p>If you use this website to apply for a job at Trusted Shops, we will collect your personal information through our job application portal, operated by an external service provider. The data you furnish through our job application portal will be used solely for the purpose of recruitment for the job advertised and to check and process your application submitted in this context.
