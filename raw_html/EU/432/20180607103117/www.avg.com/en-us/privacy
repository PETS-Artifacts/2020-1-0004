    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.1     The Avast Privacy Policy applies to Avast Software s.r.o. ("Avast") and unless specified, its subsidiaries, including AVG, Piriform (“CCleaner”), Privax Ltd (“HideMyAss!”), AVG Technologies Norway AS, TuneUp Software GmbH, and Jumpshot, Inc., and any contractors, representatives, agents, and resellers while they are working on our behalf (collectively “we,” “us” or “our”).</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.2     Our Privacy Policy explains the processing of your personal data by us and establishes what information we collect, or which is provided to us, and how we use and protect your personal data in compliance with applicable law.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.3     Personal data refers to any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”), where this identification can be made directly or indirectly, by means of identifiers such as your name, identification number, email address, phone number, online identifiers such as cookies in some circumstances, your location, your genetic, economic, cultural or social identity or other information that is specific to you.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.4     We do not mean information that only refers to a business corporation or organization. We also do not mean information that has been "anonymized," either by removing or de-identifying all specific identifiers. Anonymous data is not personal data when the anonymization is irreversible. When we refer to anonymous data, we mean data that cannot be reversed into personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.5     As a data controller, we commit ourselves to protecting the privacy of our website visitors and users of our products and services with respect to the processing of your personal data.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.6     Where we collect and process your personal data, we will limit the collection and retention to what is adequate, relevant and necessary for our purposes and it will be kept in a form which allows for your identification no longer than necessary for the purpose for which we process your personal data. We refer to this as data minimisation.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.7     Where we store your personal data for longer periods for statistical purposes, as permitted, we will use appropriate safeguards.  Applicable law defines ‘statistical purpose’ as any collection of personal data, where the result of processing is for aggregate data, so the personal data we collect from you is anonymized or pseudonymized. For example, the processing of your personal data may be for the business-related process of counting users, products, sales and various metrics.  We also share statistical data that has been anonymized and aggregated geographically and so, cannot be used to identify individuals, with third parties for trend analytics.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.8     Our policy provides you with the legal bases for the collection of your personal data, lets you know how long personal data is stored and the reasons why, and how in some circumstances, they are necessary to retain. The length of this retention and how you may choose to request that we delete some or all your personal data and the consequences of the deletion are explained in this policy.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.9     Some of the legal bases we rely on are contractual and service necessity, consent, legitimate interests and compliance with legal obligations.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.10   We want you to have the necessary and relevant understanding of how and why we process your personal data so that you can make fully informed decisions on whether to allow us to retain your personal data or delete them. Section 2 explains your rights under applicable law and section 3 lets you know when the Privacy Policy applies.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>1.11   We strive to keep the policy easy to understand and transparent, and so we refrain from technical information overload. If you wish to have further details on how we process your personal data, please contact us.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.1     We try to ensure that the users of our products and services always have an open line of communication with us. You can contact us at any time if you any questions, queries or requests about your personal data and, if European law applies to the processing of your data, about your right to request access to, modify, remove or export your data, or object to our processing of your data. We appreciate if you reach out to us first before you approach any supervisory authorities or courts.   </span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.2     In order to make it easier for you to reach out to us and obtain the necessary information and action changes, corrections or deletions of your personal data, we have decided to provide you with a privacy preference portal.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-6"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.3     Aside from the privacy preference portal, you can also submit your requests through more traditional channels. We will action your request within one month of receiving a request from you concerning any one of your rights as a data subject. Should we be inundated with requests or particularly complicated requests, the time limit may be extended to a maximum of another two months. If we fail to meet these deadlines, we would, of course, prefer that you contact us to settle the matter informally.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal eula-7"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>2.4     There could be instances where you are using our products or services, but we do not have your personal data, even though you have purchased our products or services. These include situations where you purchase our products from our service provider, a reseller, or an app store. Because your relationship in these cases is with that service provider, reseller or an app store, we do not actually have your personal data and will not be able to perform your request to access or delete your information. In such circumstances, please contact your service provider, reseller, or app store where you purchased the products or services, as this person is the primary controller of your personal data.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoNormal eula-11"><span lang="EN-AU" class='eula-3'>Access to the personal data of our users is limited to authorized personnel who have a legitimate need to know based on their job descriptions, for example, employees who provide technical support to end users, or who service user accounts. In the case of third-party contractors who process personal information on our behalf, similar requirements are imposed. These third parties are contractually bound by confidentiality clauses, even when they leave.
