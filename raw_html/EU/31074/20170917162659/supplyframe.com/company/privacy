                <p>&#8220;<strong>Anonymous Information</strong>&#8221; means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information; Anonymous Information does not permit the identification of individual persons.</p>
                <p>We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy from users of the SupplyFrame Offerings (&#8220;<strong>Users</strong>&#8221;).</p>
                <p>BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.</p>
                <p>YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY AND BY USING THE SERVICE OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH THE SERVICES, YOU ARE EXPRESSLY CONSENTING TO SUCH PROCESSING.</p>
                <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect the following Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily:</p>
