As part of the BT Group, our support for the right to privacy is part of our broader commitment to human rights. This is detailed more fully in the <a href="https://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Ourvalues/Privacyandfreeexpression/index.htm">BT Group Human Rights Policy</a></p> <p>We also have specific legal responsibilities to protect your privacy. This includes letting you know what personal information we collect about you, what we use it for and on what basis. We always need a good reason for collecting and using your personal information and we have a duty to explain to you your rights in relation to that information. You have the right to know what information we hold about you and to have a copy of it, and you can ask us to change or sometimes delete it.</p> <p>Our privacy policy explains in detail how we use your personal information. It describes what we do (or what we may do) from the moment you ask for a service from us (including when we may use your information for credit checking purposes) through to providing and billing for that service. It also explains when and how we can use your information for marketing other products that we think will interest you.</p> <p>But whatever we do with your information, we need a legal basis for doing it. We generally rely on one of three grounds (reasons) for our business processing.</p> <p>Firstly, if you have ordered or take a service from us, we are entitled to process your information so that we can provide that service to you and bill you for it.</p> <p>Secondly, if we want to collect and use your information for other purposes, we may need to ask for your consent (permission) and, if we do, that permission must always be indicated by a positive action from you (such as ticking a box) and be informed. You are also free to withdraw your permission at any time. We tend to need permission when what is proposed is more intrusive (for example, sharing your contact details with other organisations so they can market their own products and services to you).</p> <p>But we do not always need permission. In some cases, having assessed whether our use would be fair and not override your right to privacy, we may come to the view that it falls within the third ground – our 'legitimate interests' to use the information in a particular way without your permission (for example, to protect our network against cyber-attacks). But when we do this, we must tell you as you may have a right to object. And if you object specifically to us sending you marketing material, or to 'profiling you' for marketing purposes, we must then stop.</p> <p>This is all set out in detail in this policy, which focuses more on those items that we think are likely to be of most interest to you. As well as covering processing for business purposes, we give you information on circumstances in which we may have to, or can choose to, share your information.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="our-privacy-policy" class="col-md-20 col-md-offset-2 margin__bottom--s"> <h2>Our privacy policy</h2> <p>As a straight talking provider we want you to understand why we need to collect personal information, how we use that information and to feel confident we'll protect it.</p> <p>We've tried to set this out as simply as possible below.</p> <p>This policy applies to the products and services we provide (like phone, mobile, TV, broadband and email), browsing our website and if you are a member of the <a href="https://community.plus.net/">Plusnet Community</a>.

We might also share it with law enforcement agencies, as may the agencies we have shared the information with.</p> <p>If you tell us you're associated with someone else financially (for example, by marriage or civil partnership), we'll link your records together.

The agencies we share the information with also link your records together and these links will stay on your and their files – unless you or your partner successfully asks the agency to break that link.</p> <p>If we, a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, decide that you are a credit, fraud or money laundering risk, we may refuse to provide the services or financing you have asked for, or we may stop providing existing services to you.</p> <p>The credit reference and fraud prevention agencies will keep a record of any fraud or money laundering risk and this may result in other organisations refusing to provide services, financing or employment to you.

We might also give them details of your accounts and bills, including how you manage them. This includes telling them about your account balances, what you pay us and if you miss a payment (going back in the past, too). So if you don't pay your bills on time, credit reference agencies will record that. They, or a fraud prevention agency, might tell others doing similar checks – including organisations trying to trace you or recover money you owe them.</p> <p>There are different credit reference agencies in the UK (for example, Callcredit, Equifax and Experian). Each one might hold different information about you. If you want to find out what information they have on you, they may charge you a small fee.</p> <p>Whenever credit reference and fraud prevention agencies transfer your personal information outside of the European Economic Area, they place contractual responsibilities on the organisation receiving it to protect your information to the standard required in the European Economic Area.
