European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at<span class="bold"> legal@leafgroup.com</span>.</p> <p>We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the <span class="bold">BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD</span>, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" automate_uuid="49280842-829a-4c97-848e-a8cc4e5d748e"><span class="bold">http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</span></a> for more information and to file a complaint.</p> <p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p> <h2>7. The Privacy of Children</h2> <p>The Services are not intended for children under age 16. We do not knowingly collect or distribute personal information from or about children under the age of 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <span class="bold">legal@leafgroup.com</span>.</p> <h2>8. Security Measures and Storage Limits</h2> <p>We provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data we process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this data to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for data we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk.</p> <p>Our retention periods for personal data are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly anonymize the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy the data.</p> <h2>9. Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes. If you do not agree to such changes following such notice, you should discontinue your use of the Services prior to the time the modified privacy policy takes effect. If you continue using the Services after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy policy.</p> <h2>10.
