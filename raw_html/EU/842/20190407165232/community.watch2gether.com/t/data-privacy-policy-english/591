<h4>COOKIES</h4>
<p>What are cookies?<br>
Cookies are small text files that are sent when you visit a website and stored in the browser of the user. If the corresponding Internet page is retrieved, the browser of the user sends back the content of the cookies and thus enables recognition of the user. Certain cookies are automatically deleted after the end of the browser session (so-called session cookies), others are stored for a predetermined time or permanently in the user‚Äôs browser and then delete themselves (so-called temporary or permanent cookies)</p>
<p>What data is stored in the cookies?<br>

We take physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect the data we process. By doing so, we restrict access to this information to authorized employees.</p>
<p>For the cookies that our third-party advertisers place for advertising purposes, we refer to the disclaimers that they have provided on the topic on their own websites. Note that we can only refer to these disclaimers, as they change regularly and Yieldlove has no control over them.</p>
