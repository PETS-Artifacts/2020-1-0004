        <h2>7. VIRTUAL GOODS, PURCHASES, BILLING</h2>

        <div class="br"></div>

        The access to the Game and basic gameplay features is free of charge. However, the Game may permit You to
        purchase premium content, including but not limited to rights to use virtual items, access to additional
        features and additional in-game services (hereinafter collectively the <b>“Virtual Goods”</b>). Please note that
        You purchase only the rights to use the Virtual Goods, whilst the Virtual Goods, at all times remain in the
        property of the Company. In order to purchase the Virtual Goods, when using the Game through the Site, You need
        the Account.

        <div class="br"></div>

        While using the Game via the Mobile Application, the Virtual Goods may be purchased without the Account,
        however, please note that in this way (without the Account) purchased Virtual Goods cannot be used or
        transferred to the other devices. When accessing the Game via Mobile Application (without the Account) the
        Virtual Goods can be purchased inside the Game, but they can be only used within the current platform and in the
        current progress of the Game. To avoid doubt, the purchased Virtual Goods cannot be transferred from one Game to
        another, cannot be switched between the users and are only accessible in the same game progress where they were
        purchased.

        <div class="br"></div>

        Before purchasing the Virtual Goods from us You among other must ensure that:

        <div class="br"></div>

        <b>a.</b> You either are at least 18 (eighteen) years old or older if required by the applicable law or, if You
        are under age of 18 (eighteen), that Your parent or legal guardian has agreed to the respective purchase and
        these Terms of Service on Your behalf;

        <div class="br"></div>

        <b>b.</b> You or the person conducting the respective purchase on Your behalf is the authorized Account holder
        for the Account from which You or the other person is conducting a purchase or You or the other person is
        authorized to use the particular payment details (i.e., credit card);

        <div class="br"></div>

        <b>c.</b> all information You submit is true and accurate;

        <div class="br"></div>

        <b>d.</b> You agree to pay all the fees, commissions and charges associated with Your purchase.

        <div class="br"></div>

        The prices for the Virtual Goods are set in euros, US Dollars or other currency applicable to the country Your

        button. To conduct a purchase, You should click on the “Buy” button.

        <div class="br"></div>

        After clicking on the “Buy” button You will be offered to choose a payment method and enter respective payment
        details. We support payments with Visa™, MasterCard™, Maestro™ debit/credit cards along with a number of other
        payment methods applicable to Your region.

        <div class="br"></div>

        PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT STORE ANY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS ON OUR SERVERS. THE COMPANY ITSELF DOES NOT PERFORM
        ANY PROCESSING OF THE PAYMENTS. PROVISION OF PAYMENT PROCESSING IS PERFORMED SOLELY BY THE THIRD PARTY
        PLATFORMS, SUCH AS APPLE (IOS), GOOGLE (ANDROID), FACEBOOK.

        <div class="br"></div>

        Before You confirm Your purchase by clicking on any button concluding the purchase process or by fulfilling
        another action (e.g. sending a message), You must carefully review Your purchase details, including but not
        limited to the selected payment method and total price including all applicable taxes and charges. If You find
        any errors, You should correct them or cancel the purchase.

        <div class="br"></div>

        PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO PROCESS AND COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, BUT UNDER CERTAIN
        CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY NEED UP TO 72 (SEVENTY TWO) HOURS TO COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AMONG OTHER
        MAY INCLUDE YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION FAILURE AT THE MOMENT YOU CONCLUDE THE RESPECTIVE PURCHASE, ERRORS AND/ OR
        CONNECTION FAILURES ON THE SIDE OF THE PROVIDER OF THE PAYMENT SERVICES ETC.

        <div class="br"></div>

        In most cases the said period of 72 (seventy-two) hours is enough for the providers of the payment services
        either to process Your payment (so we can complete it) or automatically refund the full price of Your purchase.
        In case none of the above has happened after the expiration of the said 72 (seventy-two) hours, please contact
        our support at <a href="mailto:support@totalbattle.com">support@totalbattle.com</a>.

        <b>PAYMENTS POLICY</b>

        <div class="br"></div>

        Last Update: August 1, 2017

        <div class="br"></div>

        Hereinafter:

        <div class="br"></div>

        “We” or “Us” or “Our” should be regarded as “SCOREWARRIOR LIMITED”, “You” or “Your” should be regarded as “user”
        or “player”, “Services” should be regarded as “all and any services provided by Us”.

        <div class="br"></div>

        This Payments Policy is an integral part of the Terms of Service of the Game and Services that we provide to You
        and by starting to use our services you agree to this Payments Policy.

        <div class="br"></div>

        The prices for Virtual Goods are set in Euro, US Dollars or other currency applicable to your region and are
        displayed either in the description of corresponding Virtual Goods or on the “Buy” button. To execute a
        purchase, you should click on the “Buy” button. The lowest price of any Virtual Good is commensurable of 2.99
        USD. The highest price could reach up to 499.99 USD.

        <div class="br"></div>

        Payments accepted worldwide, but could be rejected in case you are located in Iran, North Korea, Cuba or any
        other coutry on which the international sanctions are imposed.

        <div class="br"></div>

        After clicking on the “Buy” button you will be offered to choose a payment method and enter respective payment
        details. We support payments with Visa™, MasterCard™, Maestro™ debit/credit cards along with a number of other
        payment methods applicable to your region.

        <div class="br"></div>

        NOTE THAT WE DO NOT STORE ANY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS ON OUR SERVERS. All data is stored and processed by the
        payment service provider.

        <div class="br"></div>

        Before you confirm your purchase by clicking on any conspicuously labelled button which leads to conclusion of
        the purchase process or by making other actions (e.g. sending a message), you must review carefully your
        purchase details, including but not limited to: selected payment method, total price including all applicable
        taxes and charges. If you find any errors, you should correct them or cancel the purchase.

        <div class="br"></div>

        NOTE THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO PROCESS AND COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASES AS FAST AS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE, BUT UNDER
        CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY NEED UP TO 72 (SEVENTY-TWO) HOURS TO COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MAY
        INCLUDE (WITHOUT LIMITATION): YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION FAILURE AT THE MOMENT YOU EXECUTE THE PURCHASE, ERRORS
        AND/OR CONNECTION FAILURES ON THE SIDE OF PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDER, ETC.

        <div class="br"></div>

        In most cases 72 (seventy-two) hours is enough for payment services providers either to process your payment (so
        we can complete it) or refund full price of your purchase automatically. In case none of the above happened
        after the expiration of 72 (seventy-two) hours, please kindly contact our Support Team at: <a
            href="mailto:support@totalbattle.com">support@totalbattle.com</a>.

        <b>b.</b> At any time in our sole discretion modify the sets and/or prices of Virtual Goods available for any
        user;

        <div class="br"></div>

        <b>c.</b> We may decline your request to acquire Virtual Goods for any reason.

        <b>c.</b> You cannot sell or transfer Virtual Goods to anyone, unless otherwise permitted by the Game and if
        such actions are carried out in special in-game interface;
