            PAYMENTS POLICY<br><br>

            Last Update: November 22, 2016<br><br>

            The prices for Virtual Goods are set in Euros, US Dollars or other currency applicable to your region and
            are displayed either in the description of corresponding Virtual Goods or on the “Buy” button. To conduct a
            purchase, you should click on the “Buy” button. The lowest price of any Virtual Good is commensurable of
            2.99 USD. The highest price could reach up to 499.99 USD.<br><br>

            Payments accepted worldwide, but could be rejected due your location in Iran, North Korea, Cuba.<br><br>

            After clicking on the “Buy” button you will be offered to choose a payment method and enter respective
            payment details. We support payments with Visa™, MasterCard™, Maestro™ debit/credit cards along with a
            number of other payment methods applicable to your region.<br><br>

            NOTE THAT WE DO NOT STORE ANY OF YOUR PAYMENT DETAILS ON OUR SERVERS. All data is stored on the side of payment provider.<br><br>

            Before you confirm your purchase by clicking on any conspicuously labelled button concluding the purchase
            process or by fulfilling another action (e.g. sending a message), you must carefully review your purchase
            details, including but not limited to: selected payment method, total price including all applicable taxes
            and charges. If you find any errors, you should correct them or cancel the purchase.<br><br>

            NOTE THAT WE DO OUR BEST TO PROCESS AND COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASES AS FAST AS POSSIBLE, BUT UNDER CERTAIN
            CIRCUMSTANCES WE MAY NEED UP TO 72 (SEVENTY-TWO) HOURS TO COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE. SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES MAY
            INCLUDE (WITHOUT LIMITATION): YOUR INTERNET CONNECTION FAILURE AT THE MOMENT YOU CONCLUDE THE PURCHASE,
            ERRORS AND/OR CONNECTION FAILURES ON THE SIDE OF PAYMENT SERVICE PROVIDER, ETC.<br><br>

            In most cases 72 (seventy-two) hours is enough for payment services providers either to process your payment
            (so we can complete it) or refund full price of your purchase automatically. In case none of the above
            happened after the expiration of 72 (seventy-two) hours, contact our Support at: <a
                    href="mailto:support@totalbattle.com">support@totalbattle.com</a>.<br><br>

            We reserve following rights in respect to Virtual Goods:<br><br>

            a. Offer different sets and/or prices of Virtual Goods available for purchase for different users;<br><br>

            b. At any time in our sole discretion modify the sets and/or prices of Virtual Goods available for any user;<br><br>

            c. We may decline your request to acquire Virtual Goods for any reason.<br><br>

            Following rules apply to Virtual Goods:<br><br>

            c. You cannot sell or transfer Virtual Goods to anyone, unless otherwise permitted by the Game and if such
            actions are carried out in special in-game interface;<br><br>

            d. You may only acquire Virtual Goods from us or other users of the Game via special interface inside the
            Game;<br><br>

            e. Virtual Goods cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services, except other Virtual Goods as
