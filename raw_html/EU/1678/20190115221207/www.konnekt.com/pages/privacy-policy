<p>Cookies are very small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit some websites. We use cookies to help identify your computer so we can tailor your user experience. You can disable any cookies already stored on your computer, but these may stop our website from functioning properly.</p>
<p>The Google Analytics Advertising Feature of Demographics and Interest Reporting has been implemented on www.konnekt.com.

<p><strong>Data Protection </strong></p>
<p>We are aware that we have a legal duty to respect and protect any personal information we collect from you and we will abide by such duty. We take all safeguards necessary to prevent unauthorised access and we do not pass on your details collected from you as a visitor, to any third party unless you give us your consent to do so. All data collected is processed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (hereinafter the “GDPR”).</p>
<p><strong><em>a) Information Collected</em></strong></p>
<p>In accordance with general practice, certain information will be automatically logged in respect of every request made, which information comprises (a) name or network address of the computer making the request (b) the date and time of connection (c) the http request containing identification of the documentation collected and (d) the status code of the request. This information may be utilised for system administration, bug tracking and producing usage statistics. This information may be kept indefinitely and will not be disclosed to third parties. We do not sell, trade or otherwise transfer any information to third parties. This does not however include trusted third parties who would be assisting us in operating this website, conducting our business or providing a service to you and who we ensure are bound by non-disclosure policies.
We will release your data if we are obliged to do so to comply with any law, regulation or court order.
As a visitor to this site, we may also ask you for contact or feedback information which, by providing to us, you are authorising us to collect it.</p>
<p>If you are accessing this website as a candidate (seeking employment) or a client (potential employer), you will be requested to provide additional information, including certain information which may be deemed confidential, to maximise your use of this website. Our goal is to provide the best possible employment opportunities that are tailored to you.

When you fill the forms on this website, we use the personal information submitted in the form to respond to your message and in respect of the services which we provide. </p>
<p><strong><em>b) Profile Creation</em></strong></p>
<p>Data is stored by us when a profile is created from our website. Your profile may be created in 2 ways: a) directly by you in which case you will need to read and accept this Privacy Policy; b) by us if you forward your information to us via email or any other means. The only way possible for us to proceed with any application and to track these applications is through the creation of a profile. Once a profile is created by us you will receive an email with a verification link which you will need to activate your profile. You will receive a reminder after 5 days, 20 days and 3 months with a link to verify your profile. If after 4 months, you have still not verified your profile, we will proceed to delete it and any data which would have been stored. Should you have any queries in this regard, please email us on info@konnekt.com </p>
<p>All profiles created, whether by you or by us on your behalf, are created on a system called Talexio which is wholly owned by Integrated Talent Ventures Ltd, an affiliated company with Konnekt Search &amp; Selection Ltd.</p>
<p>Where you create a profile directly but no CV is uploaded by you, you will receive an automated email within 30 minutes asking you to upload your CV in order for us to be in a position to assist. Should you fail to do so, reminders to upload your CV are sent after 3 days and subsequently after 10 days. Should you not upload a CV within 3 months, your profile will be disabled.
When a profile is created, you shall have full access to the data that you have entered and have the facility to change, delete, amend or modify this data independently. You shall have full responsibility for the accuracy of the data that you have entered.</p>
<p>Once a profile is fully active, you may be contacted in order to identify possibilities of assistance from our end. We may or may not enable or disable job alerts based on your preferences. When you are approached by us in relation to a specific vacancy or a company, you shall be given full disclosure of the companies details and your consent is essential for us to proceed.</p>
<p>Should your profile not show any activity for a period of one (1) calendar year, you will receive an automated email asking you to activate your profile in order to ensure your profile will not be deleted by us. Should you not activate or re-activate your profile for a continuous period of five (5) calendar years, your profile and all data which would have been stored by us will be deleted.</p>
<p><strong><em>c) Data Retention &amp; Use</em></strong></p>
<p>Upon creation of your profile, you shall be asked to input some personal data as mentioned in point a) above, for us to be able to get in touch with you. You shall also be asked to upload a CV which may in itself contain other personal data. This data is secured by our system and treated with the maximum degree of security. </p>
<p>In addition, we may also use different personality assessment methods and qualitative assessments in order to maximise your use of our services. Where you opt to apply directly for a vacancy being advertised on our website, we shall use that information in order to be able to track the progress of your application. We may also conduct meetings and /or telephone calls with you in order to conduct the shortlisting process for any vacancy we may have. For a better understanding on our interview process please <a href="https://www.konnekt.com/pages/candidates/candidates#interview-process">click here</a>. Based on your preferences and requirements, we may also use your details to send you job related marketing, re-marketing, digital marketing material and similar promotions via email, SMS or social media. In no circumstances will your data be sold or transferred to any other entity which is not Konnekt Search &amp; Selection Ltd or Integrated Talent Ventures Ltd for any of these marketing purposes. We retain the data on your profile for a period of five (5) years, unless you give us specific consent to retain such data by accepting our privacy policy, as may be updated at that point in time, once again.</p>
<p><strong><em>d) Information sharing and disclosure</em></strong></p>
<p>We fully recognize the confidentiality of the data submitted by any candidate and shall hold it in the strictest confidence.
Your application and CV will be directly shared or sent to our clients (prospective employers) to increase your chances of securing the job you want. </p>
<p>We may disclose your personal information:
(a)      to the extent that we are required to do so by law;
(b)      in connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings;
(c)      to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights;
(d)    to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset which we are (or are contemplating) selling;
(e) to third party service providers who perform functions on our behalf (including external consultants, business associates and professional advisers such as lawyers, auditors and accountants, technical support functions and IT consultants carrying out testing and development work on our business technology systems);
(f) to third parties who we have retained to provide services such as reference checks to the extent that these checks are appropriate and in accordance with local laws; and
(g)    to any person who we reasonably believe may apply to a court or other competent authority for disclosure of that personal information where, in our reasonable opinion, such court or authority would be reasonably likely to order disclosure of that personal information.
As part of the services offered to you, the information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). We will always take reasonable steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to be protected, as outlined in this privacy policy and in accordance with data protection laws. </p>
<p><strong><em>e) Deletion or Disabling Data</em></strong></p>
<p>Should you require at any point in time the deletion of your data, you are free to request that all and any data held by us is deleted by sending an email on info@konnekt.com. We will thereafter and within 24 hours revert to you with a confirmation that all your data has been deleted. Where you have requested the deletion of your data, should you wish to use our services in the future, you will need to re-create your profile with us.</p>
<p>Should you require your profile to be disabled, this would mean that we would retain the data that we have collected but that this data is not used in any way and you are not contacted by us for any purpose. A profile which has been disabled and not re-activated within five (5) years will be deleted upon the expiration of this term. Should you wish to re-activate your profile, you may do so by logging into your profile. There would be no need for the creation of a new profile.</p>
