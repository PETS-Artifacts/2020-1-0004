    <h1>1. Brilliant.org Privacy Statement</h1>
    <p>
        Brilliant Worldwide, Inc. ("Brilliant") knows that you care about how your personal
        information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the
        following to learn more about our Privacy Statement. By using the brilliant.org website,
        or any of our mobile applications (such as are available via the App Store and Google Play
        Store), and any related services and/or features (collectively, the "Service") you
        acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.
        If you are a resident of the European Union ("EU"), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway,
        or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation
        (the "GDPR") with respect to your Personal Information, as
        <a href="/privacy/#gdpr">outlined below</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. What Does This Privacy Statement Cover?</h2>
    <p>
        This Privacy Statement covers Brilliant's treatment of personally identifiable information
        ("Personal Information") that Brilliant gathers when you access/use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What Personal Information Does Brilliant Collect?</h2>
    <p>
        Brilliant collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the
        information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, school,
        date of birth, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        Information you elect to submit to the Service in a public or quasi-public manner may be
        disclosed to other users of the Application or the general public ("User Submission(s)").
        For example&ndash;if you make a post to a message board or chat forum that includes any
        personal information &ndash; such information will be made publicly available. We endeavor
        to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of
        an intended submission.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information
        whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address,
        domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things,
        analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no
        personally identifiable data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Do Not Track Policy.</em> Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may
        collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any
        other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and
        customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your
        browser may offer you a "Do Not Track" option, which allows you to signal to operators of
        websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that
        you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and
        across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time,
        which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using
        the Services and after you leave our Services.
    </p>

    <h2>4. What about children?</h2>
    <p>
        The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us. If you are a resident of
        the EU, United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, then you must be 16 years old or
        older to use the Services in any way. Otherwise, every user of the Service must be 13 years
        of age or older. Any person that does not meet the foregoing age requirements is a "Minor".
        Minors are prohibited from signing up or using the Service in any way. If you are a Minor,
        please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about
        yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a Minor, we
        will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a Minor may have
        provided us personal information, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy@brilliant.org">privacy@brilliant.org</a>. We reserve the right
        to require any user to verify that the user is not a Minor, and if a user does not provide
        such verification in a timely manner, we will terminate the user's account and delete all
        personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from such user.
    </p>

    <h2>5. How does Brilliant use the information it collects?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Provide the Service: Your information will be used primarily to provide you with the
            Service.
        </li>
        <li>
            Improve the Service: Your information may be used by us internally to improve the
            Service and develop new products, services and features.
        </li>
        <li>
            Other Uses: Your information may also be used by us as set forth in the next section.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Will Brilliant Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?</h2>
    <p>
        To the limited extent we collect Personal Information &ndash; we neither rent nor sell your
        Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Recipient of User Submissions:</em> As mentioned above &ndash; your User Submissions
        may be shared in a public or quasi-public manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Service Providers and Agents:</em> We employ other companies and people to perform
        tasks on our behalf. For example, we may decide to use a third party payment processing
        company to process payments you make through the Service. In addition, parts of the Service
        may be hosted by a third party on our behalf. Your information may be accessed by such
        providers/agents, in the event that we need to share your information with them to provide
        our services or customer support to you. Unless we tell you differently, Brilliant's agents
        do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is
        necessary to assist us.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Business Transfers:</em> In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
        types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that
        are transferred. Moreover, if Brilliant, or substantially all of its assets were acquired,
        or in the unlikely event that Brilliant goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer
        information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
        You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Brilliant may
        continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Protection of Brilliant and Others:</em> We may release Personal Information when we
        believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply
        our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of
        Brilliant, our employees, our users, or others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>With Your Consent:</em> Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your
        Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the
        sharing of this information.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Conditions of Use</h2>
    <p>
        If you decide to access or use the Service, such access and use and any possible dispute
        over privacy is subject to this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use (located on our
        website), including limitations on damages, disclaimer of warranties, and the application
        of California state law.
    </p>

        contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under Brilliant control, and such
        links do not constitute an endorsement by Brilliant of those other websites or the services
        offered through them. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the
        Service are not covered by this Privacy Statement, and Brilliant is not responsible for the
        privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

    <h2>10. Privacy Shield</h2>
    <p>
        The Services are hosted and operated in the United States ("U.S.") through Brilliant and
        its service providers, and if you do not reside in the U.S., laws in the U.S. may differ
        from the laws where you reside. By using the Services, you acknowledge that any Personal
        Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, is
        being provided to Brilliant in the U.S. and will be hosted on U.S. servers, and you
        authorize Brilliant to transfer, store and process your information to and in the U.S., and
        possibly other countries. You hereby consent to the transfer of your data to the U.S.
        pursuant to EU-US and Swiss&ndash;US Privacy Shield Framework, the details of which are
        further set forth below.
    </p>
    <p>
        Brilliant has certified to the EU.-U.S. and Swiss&ndash;US Privacy Shield Framework set
        forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection and use of Personal Data
        transferred from the EU and Switzerland. For more information about the Privacy Shield

        Brilliant is committed to the Privacy Shield Principles of (1) notice, (2) consent, (3)
        accountability for onward transfer, (4) security, (5) data integrity and purpose
        limitation, (6) access and (7) recourse, enforcement and liability with respect to all
        Personal Data received from within the EU and Switzerland in reliance on the Privacy
        Shield. The Privacy Shield Principles require that we remain potentially liable if any
        third party processing subject Personal Data on our behalf fails to comply with these
        Privacy Shield Principles (except to the extent we are not responsible for the event giving
        rise to any alleged damage). Brilliant's compliance with the Privacy Shield is subject to
        the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.

    <p>
        For this GDPR section, we use the terms "Personal Data" and "processing" as they are
        defined in the GDPR, but "Personal Data" generally means information that can be used to
        individually identify a person, and "processing" generally covers actions that can be
        performed in connection with data such as collection, use, storage and disclosure.
        Brilliant will be the controller of your Personal Data processed in connection with the
        Sites. Note that we may also process Personal Data of our customers' end users or employees
        in connection with our provision of services to customers, in which case we are the
        processor of Personal Data. If we are the processor of your Personal Data (i.e., not the
        controller), please contact the controller party in the first instance to address your
        rights with respect to such data. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are any conflicts between this section and any other provision of this Privacy
        Policy, the policy or portion that is more protective of Personal Data shall control to the
        extent of such conflict. If you have any questions about this section or whether any of the

        We also share Personal Data when necessary to complete a transaction initiated or
        authorized by you or provide you with a product or service you have requested. In addition
        to those set forth above, these parties also include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Other users (where you post information publicly or as otherwise necessary to effect a
            transaction initiated or authorized by you through the Sites)
        </li>
        <li>Social media services (if you interact with them through your use of the Sites)</li>
        <li>Other parties authorized by you</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We also share information with third parties when you have given us consent to do so (as
        indicated at the point such information is collected).
    </p>
    <p>We also share Personal Data when we believe it is necessary to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law
            enforcement or other government agencies
        </li>
        <li>
            Protect us, our business or our users, for example to enforce our Terms and Conditions,
            prevent spam or other unwanted communications and investigate or protect against fraud
        </li>
        <li>Maintain the security of our products and services</li>
        <li>Provide a service directly authorized and requested by you, the end user</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Furthermore, if we choose to buy or sell assets, user information is typically one of the
        transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were
        acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of
        the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party, and we would share Personal
        Data with the party that is acquiring our assets. You acknowledge that such transfers may
        occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your Personal
        Information as set forth in this policy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>How Long Do We Retain Your Personal Data?</u></strong> We retain Personal Data
        about you as long as you have an open account with us or as otherwise necessary to provide
        you Services. In some cases we retain Personal Data for longer, if doing so is necessary to
        comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes or collect fees owed, or is otherwise
        permitted or required by applicable law, rule or regulation. Afterwards, we retain some
        information in a depersonalized or aggregated form but not in a way that would identify you
        personally.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>What Security Measures Do We Use?</u></strong> We seek to protect Personal Data
        using appropriate technical and organizational measures based on the type of Personal Data
        and applicable processing activity. For example, we encrypt all data in-transit, obfuscate
        and anonymize data that we share with processors like analytics services, and maintain all
        services with security patches in a timely manner. We also require that our suppliers
        protect such information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><u>Personal Data of Children:</u></strong> We do not knowingly collect or solicit
        Personal Data from anyone under the age of 16. If you are under 16, please do not attempt
        to register for the Sites or send any Personal Data about yourself to us. If we learn that
        we have collected Personal Data from a child under age 16, we will delete that information
        as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 16 may have provided us Personal
        Data, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:privacy+gdpr@brilliant.org">privacy+gdpr@brilliant.org</a>.
    </p>

        that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as
        if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if
        it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you
        of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional
        information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary to verify your identity and the
        nature of your request.
