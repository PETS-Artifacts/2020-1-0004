Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending on whether you access our site through an "always-on" type of Internet connection (e.g., cable modem or DSL), or through a dial-up connection (e.g., AOL or Earthlink). Either way, it would be extremely difficult for us to identify you through your IP address by itself, and we make no attempt to do so. We also collect information on whether you reached our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, which helps us to maximize our Internet exposure, and to understand the interests of our users. We also collect information on your ISP or mobile carrier and the type of handheld or mobile device you used. All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our visitors, but not reports about individual visitors.</p>

        <p>CarGurus uses a reputable third party, Google Analytics, to collect information through Data Technologies. This data is collected on an anonymized basis and in the aggregate, but may include or be associated with other non-personally identifiable information or with personally identifiable information that users have voluntarily submitted. Our primary goal in collecting user information is to enhance your experience on our site. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") that helps website owners understand how visitors engage with their website. We can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with our website so we can improve it. Google Analytics collects information anonymously. Google uses first party cookies and IP addresses, and it reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. We do NOT authorize Google Analytics to use the data it collects from this site. For more information related to Google Analytics, click <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank">here</a>. For information about and to install Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on, click <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

        <p>We may partner with advertising networks, which may use information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us and other advertisers. We may also act as an advertising network and use information collected through a variety of Data Technologies while you are on our site and elsewhere where we may be acting as a third party. This data collection takes place both on the site and on third-party's websites and mobile applications. This process allows CarGurus and third parties to deliver targeted advertising, enhance marketing programs and help track the effectiveness of such efforts. Advertising networks also may use this information for determining or predicting the characteristics and preferences of their respective advertising audiences and measuring the effectiveness of their advertising in accordance with their privacy policies.</p>

        <p>We do not provide information that is directly associated with a specific person (such as name and address) to any advertising network when you interact with or view a customized advertisement. However, when you view or interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may make an assumption that you are interested in the subject matter of the advertisement.</p>

        <p>Some companies disclose when they are using interest-based advertising programs on the site to deliver third-party ads or collecting information about your visit for these purposes and give you the ability to opt-out of this use of your information. You may see an iconÂ in or around third-party advertisements on the site that use interest-based advertising programs and on pages where data is collected and used for online interest-based advertising. Clicking on this icon will provide additional information about the companies and data practices that were used to deliver the ad. You can opt out of delivery of targeted advertising to you by CarGurus and by multiple other companies by visiting: <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>, <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp" target="_blank">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="www.evidon.com" target="_blank">www.evidon.com</a>. Please note that even if you opt out, you will continue to receive advertisements, but they will not be tailored to your specific interests.</p>

        <p>We or advertisers on our site also use Data Technologies, as follows.</p>

        <a name="cookies"></a><h4>Cookies</h4>

        <p>This section explains how and why we use cookies. This site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users on our site. We place a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer's hard drive or mobile device or application. The term cookies includes similar technologies for collecting and storing information, such as Local Shared Objects (commonly referred to as "flash cookies") and web beacons or web bugs (including transparent or clear gifs). A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our site and to determine whether you have visited us before. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other websites.</p>

        <p>We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site.</p>

        <p>Session cookies allow us to track your actions during a single browser session, for example to remember the items returned from a search. They do not remain on your device beyond your session.</p>

        <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device between sessions and allow us to authenticate you and to remember your preferences. We also use them to balance the load on our servers and thus to enhance your experience on our website.</p>

        <p>Session and persistent cookies can be either first or third-party cookies - a first-party cookie is set by the website being visited. A third-party cookie is issued by a different website to that being visited.</p>

        <p>Our website uses a mixture of first-party, session and persistent cookies to deliver its services efficiently and to enhance your experience.</p>

        <p>You may refuse to accept a cookie from us by following the procedures specific to your web browser or by adjusting the use of advertising identifiers on mobile devices through the settings on your device. If you disable our cookies, you may find that your browser reacts strangely when visiting our site, and some portions of the site may not work properly if you refuse cookies.</p>


        <h4>Local Shared Objects or "Flash Cookies"</h4>

        <p>"Local shared objects," sometimes known as "Flash cookies", may be used by entities who advertise on our site to store your preferences or display content based upon what you have viewed on various websites or mobile applications to personalize your visit. To control your use of Flash cookies, visit Adobe's website at <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html" target="_blank">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a> for tools to control and disable Flash cookies. If you use Firefox, you can also obtain an add-on to detect and delete Flash cookies by visiting <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/" target="_blank">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/</a> and clicking "Add to Firefox".</p>

        <p>These are used to recognise you when you return to our website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).</p>


        <h4>Web Beacons</h4>

        <p>A "web beacon," also known as an "Internet tag", "pixel tag" or "clear GIF", links web pages to web servers and their cookies. We only use web beacons in emails we send to you to notify us that the email was opened. We do not use web beacons to track your behavior through the site or other Internet sites for online behavioral advertising.</p>

        <h4>Applications and Widgets for Social Media</h4>

        <p>On our site, we may display applications or widgets from social media providers that allow interaction or content sharing by their users. These widgets, such as the FacebookÂ® "Share" or "Like" button, are visible to you on the CarGurus web page you visit.</p>

        <p>Because CarGurus displays applications or widgets from social media networks, such as FacebookÂ®, TwitterÂ® and others, on our site, this may allow the social media networks in which you participate to collect information about you, even when you do not explicitly activate the network's application or widget. Please visit the applicable social media network's privacy policy to better understand their data collection practices and the choices they make available to you about opting out of their data collection. The privacy policy of the social media network controls the collection, use and disclosure of all personal data transmitted to that network.</p>

        <p>In addition to social media networks, our site also contains references and links to third party web sites that may offer information of interest. This Data Protection Policy does not apply to those web sites, and we recommend reviewing those web sites' privacy policies individually. As discussed in CarGurus' Terms and Conditions of Use, CarGurus is not responsible for the content of such third parties.</p>

In that way, we can save your preferences from visit to visit and present you with a customized site, without requiring you to log into our site every time you visit.</p>

It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the provision of support services.

        <h2>Security - steps we take to protect your personal data.</h2>

        <p>CarGurus has implemented commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical security measures to help protect the personal data stored in our systems against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. For example, we limit access to personal data about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes (such as password hashing, login auditing, and idle session termination) to protect against unauthorized access to your personal data. Technical measures also include use of firewall protection and in some instances may include encryption technology. Although we take reasonable precautions to assess the reliability of such technology, we rely on the statements of the vendors of those products and services as part of its security evaluation. Please note that although CarGurus has endeavored to create a secure and reliable Site for users, the confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to/from the Site, and the security of your personal data, cannot be guaranteed. CarGurus urges you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.</p>

        <p>Any personal data that CarGurus collects is kept as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Data Protection Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by law. When we no longer need to retain your personal data, it will be destroyed or anonymized in a manner that designed to preserve its private and confidential nature. Complete removal may not be immediate, however, and in some instances, archival copies may be impossible to delete.</p>

After we receive confirmation, we will remove your data from our active database, but some information may remain in our archives for our own corporate recordkeeping and logs under law and in the event of possible future litigation. As a practical matter, given the number of car sellers, dealers or manufacturers, we may not be able to remove your data from car sellers, dealers or manufacturersâ€™ databases, if we have transmitted any information to them. </p>
