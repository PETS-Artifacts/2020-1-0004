<h4 id="RIGHTS-IN-RELATION-TO-YOUR-PERSONAL-DATA">RIGHTS IN RELATION TO YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h4>
<p>You have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, in particular under the General Data Protection
    Regulation (GDPR) you have the following rights:</p>

<ol>
    <li>To
        <strong>request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “<a href="/static/resources/Subject-Access-Request-Form-V1-April-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Subject Access Request</a>”). This enables you to
        receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
    <li>To request
        <strong>confirmation</strong> as to whether or not your personal data is being processed.</li>
    <li>To request
        <strong>the correction of your personal data</strong> that you consider to be inaccurate. This enables you to have any incomplete
        or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected. However, we may need to verify your identity and the accuracy of
        the new data you provide to us.</li>
    <li>To request
        <strong>erasure of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data, for example:
        i) where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it; ii) where you have successfully exercised your
        right to object to processing (see below); iii) where we may have processed your information unlawfully; iv) where
        we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able
        to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons. These reasons will be notified to you at the time
        of your request.</li>
    <li>To
        <strong>object to processing of your personal data</strong>. This enables you to object to the processing of your personal
        data if you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, this can be where we are processing
        your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may have compelling legitimate grounds to process
        your information which can override your right to object.</li>
    <li>To request
        <strong>restriction of processing your personal data</strong>. This gives you the option to ask us to suspend the processing
        of your personal data in the following scenarios: i) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; ii) where our
        use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; iii) where you need us to hold the data, even if
        we no longer require it e.g. to establish or defend legal claims; or iv) you have objected to our use of your data
        but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate ground to use it.</li>
    <li>To request
        <strong>transfer of your personal data</strong>. If you request us to do so, we will provide to you, or a third party of
        your choice, your personal data in a commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to
        automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use, or where we have used the information to
        perform a contract with you.</li>
    <li>To
        <strong>withdraw consent to the processing of your data</strong>. If you request us to do so, we will no longer process your
        data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.
        If you withdraw your consent, we will not be able to provide the Services for you. Also, we will advise you of this
        at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
    <li>To not have a decision made about you based solely on
        <strong>automated processing</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, in the first instance, please email us at
    <a href="mailto:privacy@trustedhousesitters.com">privacy@trustedhousesitters.com</a>
    using the
    <a href="/static/resources/Subject-Access-Request-Form-V1-April-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Subject Access Request</a> form. </p>
<p>We will respond to you within 30 days of receipt of your request. Occasionally it may take us longer than 30 days if your
    request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you
    updated.
</p>
<p>You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (www.ico.org.uk). We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please email us <a href="mailto:privacy@trustedhousesitters.com">privacy@trustedhousesitters.com</a> in the first instance.</p>

<h4 id="MARKETING-BY-US">MARKETING  BY US</h4>

<p>We may use your personal data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This
    is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if i) you have requested information from us; or ii) if you provided us
    with your details when you entered a competition; or iii) registered for a promotion; and, in each case, you have not
    opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>

<h4 id="THIRD-PARTY-MARKETING">THIRD PARTY MARKETING</h4>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties, however, we do provide Members with access to the ‘Hand-picked offers
    for you’ area of the dashboard. These offers are from third parties who we think may be able to provide you with products
    or services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<h4 id="UNSUBSCRIBE-FROM-MARKETING-COMMUNICATIONS">UNSUBSCRIBE FROM MARKETING AND COMMUNICATIONS </h4>

<p>You can ask us to stop sending you electronic messages (e.g. emails) at any time by (i) clicking the unsubscribe links on any electronic message sent to you or (ii) contact us using the details in the Contact us section of the Platform with your request to unsubscribe from our database.
</p>
<p>Just to let you know, should you choose to unsubscribe, not only will you no longer receive any marketing emails, you will
    also no longer receive any emails from us including, for example, password reset emails, daily sitter alert emails, emails
    notifying you of a message from another member, and any emails regarding your account i.e. your auto renewal notifications.</p>
<p>If you would like to continue only receiving emails relating to your account (i.e. not marketing emails) please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trustedhousesitters.com">privacy@trustedhousesitters.com</a>.</p>

<h4 id="DOES-MY-DATA-GO-OUTSIDE-OF-THE-EEA">DOES MY DATA GO OUTSIDE OF THE EEA </h4>
<p>We will use third party service providers that are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and this will involve the
    transfer of your personal data outside the EEA. As a result, the transferred data may not be processed and protected
    in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy. You need to be aware that if your information is transferred to a
    country outside the EEA, that country may not have adequate data protection laws or appropriate safeguards. </p>
<p>Many of our Members are based outside the EEA. This means that if you communicate with another one of our Members, your personal
    data may be transferred outside the EEA. As a result, the transferred data may not be processed and protected in the
    same way as set out in this Privacy Policy. You need to be aware that if your information is transferred to a country
    outside the EEA, that country may not have adequate data protection laws or appropriate safeguards. </p>
<p>However, when we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we endeavour to ensure that a similar degree of protection is
    afforded to it by implementing at least one of the following safeguards: </p>

<ul>
    <li>By transferring personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal
        data by the European Commission.</li>
    <li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
        personal data the same protection it has in Europe. </li>
    <li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires
        them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trustedhousesitters.com">privacy@trustedhousesitters.com</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>

<h4 id="DATA-SECURITY">DATA SECURITY</h4>

<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, altered or disclosed, used or accessed in an unauthorised way. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know it. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. However, the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure and we cannot guarantee that unauthorised parties will not be able to defeat those measures.</p>

<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator
    of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>


<h4 id="DATA-RETENTION">DATA RETENTION</h4>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or internal reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal
    data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
    process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for compliance,
    governance, legal and/or regulatory purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice
    to you.</p>

<h4 id="SUBJECT-ACCESS-REQUEST">SUBJECT ACCESS REQUEST</h4>
<p>If you have any queries regarding how your personal data is processed, you can submit a
    <a href="/static/resources/Subject-Access-Request-Form-V1-April-2018.pdf" target="_blank">Subject Access Request</a>. You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise Your Legal Rights).
    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively,
    we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>

<h4 id="WHAT-INFORMATION-WE-MAY-NEED-FROM-YOU">WHAT INFORMATION WE MAY NEED FROM YOU</h4>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your
    personal data (or to exercise Your Legal Rights). This is a security measure to ensure that your personal data is not
    disclosed to any person who does not have the right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information,
    in relation to your request, to speed up our response.</p>
<h4 id="PROCESSING-YOUR-DATA-FOR-OTHER-PURPOSES">PROCESSING YOUR DATA FOR OTHER PURPOSES</h4>
<p>In the future we may decide to sell, transfer or merge parts or our business or our assets. Alternatively we may seek to
    acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal
    data in the same way as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason, and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trustedhousesitters.com">privacy@trustedhousesitters.com</a></p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules,
    where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
