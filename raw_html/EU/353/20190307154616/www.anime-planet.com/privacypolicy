used to maintain our network security as part of our efforts to protect your data.

<li>
<b>Activity Feed.</b> Some functionality of the Website relies on data observed from your other
interactions with the Website (rather than being directly provided by you). One such example is the
activity feed where we use your activity on the Website to build a feed of activity on the Website that
other users (also known as "friends") can follow.

<b>Changes to your Anime and Manga Lists.</b> The changes made to your anime and manga lists are observed
to provide you with the functionality seen as part of the challenges feature. This information is tracked
regardless of your participation in a challenge to increase the accuracy of the contents of the challenges.

(or 16 in the case of the European Economic Area) has provided us with personal information,
we will promptly delete such information.

<h2>Information Sharing By Anime-Planet</h2>
<p>
Anime-Planet does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated
companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the
following circumstances:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We provide the information to partners who work on behalf of or with Anime-Planet under confidentiality
agreements. These companies may use your personal information in connection with Anime-Planet's provision
of the Service to you. They may also communicate with you about offers from Anime-Planet and our marketing
partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
</li>
<li>
We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or
defend against legal claims.
</li>
<li>
We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding
illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any
person, violations of Anime-Planet's terms of use posted on the Website
(<b><a href="/termsofuse">Terms of Use</a></b>), or as otherwise required by law.
</li>
<li>
We may transfer information about you if Anime-Planet is acquired by or merged with another company. In
such event, Anime-Planet will notify you, via an announcement on our Website, before information about
you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anime-Planet displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers
(including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click
targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular
geographic area.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Anime-Planet does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact
with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are
consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet
the targeting criteria used to display the ad.
</li>
<li>
Anime-Planet advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance
agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores,
airlines, and software companies).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may share aggregated information that includes non-identifying information with third parties for
industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and
services. Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your personal information.
</p>
<h2>Information Sharing By You</h2>
<p>
Please be aware that when you register to become an Anime-Planet member, post recommendations and reviews,
register for and/or participate in forums and create personal lists such as lists of favorite characters,
personal anime/manga lists, etc., other users are able to see that information, including any information
that you provide about you, location, gender, birth date and/or age, your screen or user name, in addition to
any comments or submissions that you post or submit. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive
information and that you not use your real name as your screen or user name to the extent that allows others
to identify you.
</p>

</p>
<p>
After you delete your account, we may continue to post any recommendations, synopses, descriptions, reviews,
ratings, lists, contest related information, comments and other information and data you posted through or in

<h2>Links to Third-Party Sites</h2>
<p>
This Policy does not apply to the practices of people or companies that may be referenced on

advertisement, or by clicking on another third-party link, you will be directed to that
third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other

affiliated with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information
security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third-party websites. Those
other third-party websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer,
collect data or solicit personal information from you. Other third-party websites and services
have their own policies regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information that you

third-party websites you visit.
