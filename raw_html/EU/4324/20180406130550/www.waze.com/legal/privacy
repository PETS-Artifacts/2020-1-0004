<p>Please note that the username you choose will be used to identify you when you use the Services. Your username will be included along with any information you submit for posting (such as traffic reports or chat messages). It will therefore be visible to others. If you prefer to remain invisible to other users of the Services for a particular drive, you can set the Application not to show your location on the map. To do so you should go to the Application Settings Menu and adjust accordingly. If you make this choice, while you will be invisible to other users, your location and route information will continue to be collected by Waze for the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>You may also provide additional information that will be used to personalize the Services and enhance your experience with the Services. For example, if you provide us with your “home” and “work” information, we may provide you with what we think is the shortest route between those locations.</p>

<p>Further information may be collected when Waze exchanges communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact Waze’s support team, or report a violation to the abuse team.</p>

<h3 id="personal-information-that-you-share">Personal information that you share</h3>

<p>The Services are based on a community of users publicly sharing information with Waze and with other members of that community.</p>

<p>In particular, users choose to share personal information such as name, age, gender, picture, their location information, reports and other files. This information may be shared either directly to the Service and to all users, such as in the case of traffic reports, or just to your friends on Waze via the “find friends” feature . This information may also be shared via third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Service upon such users’ choice.</p>

<p><strong>The content that you share to all users is neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it</strong>. Information you upload will be posted along with other personal information. Certain road incidents you report may include your driving path within the vicinity of those incidents. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.</p>

<p>You can decide whether or not to upload content to the Services. However any content that you submit for posting, may be viewed by all users of the Services and by Waze.</p>

<p>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</p>

<p>Waze collects voice information, including voice files if you either record your own voice, or use the voice command features. If, after recording your own voice, you chose to share your voice recordings, other Waze users and other people will be able to download and use your voice recordings. Once downloaded, Waze may not have any control over the voice files, so you should only share content that you are comfortable being made public.</p>

<p>We, at Waze, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Service. However, Waze has no control over the conduct of any user and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made.</p>

<p>Participating in any user’s activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using Waze, is entirely at your own risk. Waze is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances. The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulation or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-social-networks">Integration with social networks</h3>

<p>You may choose to share information between your Account and your social network account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from Waze, including your location and route information, transmitted to and shared through your social network account.</p>

<p>By setting your Account to integrate with social networks including by signing onto Waze by using your social network account (such as your Facebook account and your Google account), you agree to share information (including personal information) between Waze and such social networks, for the purposes provided under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The social network’s use of information made available by Waze is governed by that social network’s privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Privacy Policy or Waze.</p>

<p>When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your information from your social network account only in accordance with the permissions granted by you.</p>

<p>Accordingly we only collect such information which you allowed the social network(s) to share with third parties (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture, other information available via the applicable social network). You understand and agree that the Services may access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the third party social network) such information so that it is available on and through your Account, until your Account is deleted.</p>

<p>Please note that certain information which you have defined as private on your third party social network accounts may become public to other Waze Users through the Services once you have allowed the social network to share such information with Waze.</p>

<h3 id="integration-with-other-third-party-services">Integration with other third party services</h3>

<p>Waze offers you the option to link Waze to third party services that may be useful to you. Where Waze detects an integration may be available (either because a third party service attempts to link to Waze, or Waze detects an installed service on the device which has an integration option, or you request a particular integration), Waze will ask for confirmation to connect the accounts. If you choose to connect the accounts and after connecting, Waze will ask for your permission to share data with the third party service. You should only agree to connect accounts if you are comfortable with the third party service receiving the data set out at the time of connecting the accounts and Waze is not responsible for the third party service’s use of data. You can disconnect Waze and the third party service at any time and Waze will cease sharing data with that service from the point of disconnection onwards.</p>

<h3 id="meta-data-that-we-collect">Meta-data that we collect</h3>

<p>Waze collects information about the use of the Services and information from the device you have Waze installed on.

<p>On receiving such a request, Waze will use reasonable efforts to delete such information, however please note we may not delete information immediately from our back-up systems.</p>

<p>If you find that the information associated with your Account is not accurate, complete or updated, then you must make all necessary changes to correct it. Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent you from setting up a username and impair the ability to provide you with Services.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-waze-use-aggregated-information">How does Waze use aggregated information?</h3>

<p>Waze may use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information (including anonymous location information), in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, to properly operate the Services, to improve the quality of the Services, to enhance your experience, to create new services and features, including customized services, to change or cancel existing content or service, and for further internal, commercial and statistical purposes (including advertising).</p>

<p>Waze may also use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information collected on the Services, in a form that does not enable the identification of a specific user, by posting, disseminating, transmitting or otherwise communicating or making available such information to users of the Services, to the Services’ providers, partners and any other third party.

Waze implements systems, applications and procedures to secure your personal information, to minimize the risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information. However, these measures are unable to provide absolute assurance.

<p>You agree to be bound by any of the changes made in the terms of this Privacy Policy. Continuing to use the Services will indicate your acceptance of the amended terms. If you do not agree with any of the amended terms, you must avoid any further use of the Services.</p>
