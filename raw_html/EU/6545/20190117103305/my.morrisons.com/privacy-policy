                    <br> Please note that for our Morrisons More mobile app, in order to be able to provide you with the best
                    and most appropriate offers, promotions, product information and content, we need to build up a profile
                    of what you like and dislike and what you may have previously been interested in. As part of this, we
                    retain all data that you choose to delete from the app (such as a previous shopping list) for a limited
                    time. We use it to compare your deleted data with the data you currently store so that we can work out
                    what you are no longer interested in. By doing so we help ensure that the app content and the offers
                    and promotions we show you are as relevant to you as possible. We will only retain your personal information
                    for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, for example for any legal, accounting,
                    or reporting requirements.</p>
                <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and
                    Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see
                    <i>Request erasure</i> below for further information.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with
                    you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without
                    further notice to you.</p>

                <h3>Your duty to inform us of changes</h3>
                <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed
                    if your personal information changes by keeping your details up to date on your More Card and online
                    shopping accounts.</p>
                <h3>Your rights in connection with personal information</h3>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request access:</strong>&nbsp;To your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access
                        request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to
                        check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>No fee usually required:&nbsp;</strong>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal
                            data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
                            request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your
                            request in these circumstances.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>What we may need from you:&nbsp;</strong>We may need to request specific information from you
                            to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise
                            any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed
                            to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
                            information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Time limit to respond:&nbsp;</strong>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one
                            month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex
                            or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.&nbsp;</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request access:</strong>&nbsp;Of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you
                        to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. We may need to verify
                        the accuracy of any new data you provide to us.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request erasure:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete
                        or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You
                        also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised
                        your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully
                        or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that
                        we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which
                        will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Object to processing:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate
                        interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which
                        makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we
                        are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate
                        that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which means we can continue
                        to process your personal information.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Request the restriction of processing:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information. This enables you
                        to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
                        <ul>
                            <li>(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;</li>
                            <li>(b)&nbsp;where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it;</li>
                            <li>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish,
                                exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                            <li>(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding
                                legitimate grounds to use it.&nbsp;</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Request the transfer:</b>&nbsp;Of your personal information to another party. We will provide to
                        you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable
                        format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent
                        for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.&nbsp;</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time:&nbsp;</strong>Where we are relying on consent to process your
                        personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before
                        you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
                        or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Fees for excessive or unreasonable requests</h3>
                <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights).
                    However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively,
                    we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances.</p>
                <h3>What we may need from you</h3>
                <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right
                    to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security
                    measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive
                    it.
