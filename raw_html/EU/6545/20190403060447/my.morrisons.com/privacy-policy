This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).  <p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing. <p> <strong>Third-party marketing</strong>  <p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Morrisons group of companies for marketing purposes.&nbsp; <p> <strong>Opting out</strong>  <p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time through our website or by <a title="Contact Us" href=https://my.morrisons.com/help target=_top> <i>contacting us</i> </a> at any time. <p> <strong>Cookies</strong>  <p>You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies.

For example, we’ll share information from our online food business with Morrisons.com and there are similar arrangements between our other online and store-based businesses. This is because we hope to have a relationship with you across all our different brands and businesses, if not now, then sometime in the future and we want to be able to provide you with the same value-for-money, high quality experience whenever and however you shop with us. It’s also the only way we can provide you with the full benefits of our Morrisons More card. <h3>External Third Parties</h3> <ul><li> <strong>Service providers:&nbsp;</strong>acting as processors based within the EEA who provide IT and system administration services.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Professional advisers:&nbsp;</strong>acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers based within the EEA who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and professional service providers.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities:&nbsp;</strong>acting as processors or joint controllers based in the United Kingdom who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances. </ul> <ul><li> <strong>Other people who help us provide our websites, mobile apps, in-store WIFI networks, stores, Morrisons More card and related services to you:</strong>&nbsp;They include information technology experts who design and host our websites, and payment services companies that make it easy for you to use your credit or payment cards with us. Other examples include market research companies, marketing, advertising, design and PR organisations and general service companies such as printers, mailing houses and form-scanning service providers.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Our insurers and insurance brokers:</strong>&nbsp;who provide us with comprehensive cover against the risks of running a business as big as ours. (They may keep this information for the purpose of ongoing risk assessment and insurance broking and underwriting services.)</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Banks and finance companies:&nbsp;</strong>where we have allowed them to offer you the possibility of buying our products on credit or with a loan arranged through our stores or online. (They may keep this information for their related banking and finance purposes)</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Credit reference agencies:</strong>&nbsp;who supply anti-fraud and credit-insight information to us, central and local government departments such as the Driver Vehicle Licence Agency (DVLA) and local authorities who run the UK electoral rolls, banks and finance companies that also provide anti-fraud services, and customer insight companies. Where anti-fraud is concerned, the organisations concerned may hold your information on file for future anti-fraud-prevention purposes.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Third-party companies:</strong>&nbsp;whose products and services we sell, so they can better understand the profile of our customers who buy from or are interested in them. However, all the information we share will be collected and anonymised, so neither you nor any of your devices can be identified from it.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>With social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter:&nbsp;</strong>and our advertising partners to enable us to run targeted promotions for you on their platforms;</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Rewards companies:</strong>&nbsp;which you have signed up to, in order for you to receive the rewards and benefits they offer when you shop with us. (They may keep this information)</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Any new business partners:&nbsp;</strong>we may have over time, for example, in the event of a joint venture, reorganisation, business merger or sale that affects us.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>The Police, local authorities, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC), the courts and any other government authority:&nbsp;</strong>if they ask us to do so (but only if us doing so is lawful).</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Other people who make a ‘subject access request':</strong>&nbsp;where we are required to do so by law. </ul> <ul><li> <strong>We may also share the information we collect where we are legally obliged to do so, e.g. to comply with a court order.</strong> </ul> <ul><li> <strong>Social media, blogs, reviews, etc.</strong> </ul> <ul><li> <strong>Any social media posts or comments you send to us:&nbsp;</strong>(on the Morrisons Facebook page, for instance) will be shared under the terms of the relevant social media platform (e.g. Facebook or Twitter) on which they’re written, and could be made public. Other people, not us, control these platforms. We’re not responsible for this kind of sharing. Before you make any remarks or observations about anything, you should review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of the social media platforms you use. That way, you’ll understand how they will use your information, what information relating to you they will place in the public domain, and how you can stop them from doing so if you’re unhappy about it. It’s worth remembering too that any blog, review or other posts or comments you make about us, our products and services on any of our blogs, reviews or user community services will be shared with all other members of that service and the public at large. You should take extra care to ensure that any comments you make on these services, and on social media in general are fit to be read by the public, and are not offensive, insulting or defamatory. Ultimately, you are responsible for ensuring that any comments you make comply with any relevant policy on acceptable use of those services. </ul> <ul><li> <strong>Mobile app platforms</strong> <strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Our mobile apps run on third party software platforms, for example, Apple’s iOS platform, which powers Apple’s iPhone, and Google’s Android platform, which powers Android-based smartphones. If you use <b>any of our mobile apps</b>, your usage of those apps is also subject to the relevant mobile app platform provider’s terms and conditions and privacy policy. You should review their terms and conditions and privacy policy to ensure you understand what information (if any) they will gather on you, how they will use that information, and what you may be able to do if you are unhappy about it.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Morrisons Flowerworld, Nutmeg and Food to Order Payments</strong> <strong>:</strong>&nbsp;When using the Morrisons Flowerworld and Food to Order services we use a different payment processor to that used for processing orders from the Morrisons Groceries site. Payments for the Morrisons Flowerworld services are processed through a payment processing company called Stripe, and payment for the Food to Order service are processed through Barclays Bank plc trading as Barclaycard.&nbsp;Stripe and Barclaycard will process your credit or debit card data. This data is handled according to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliant rules and processes.&nbsp; We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order.&nbsp; We securely transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. All direct payment gateways adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Third parties:</strong>&nbsp;to whom we may choose to sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice. We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.&nbsp; We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</ul> <p>  <dt class=faq__question> <h3>International Transfers</h3>  <dd class=faq__answer> <p> <p>We share your personal data within the Morrisons Group. This may involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area ( <b>EEA</b>). <p>Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area ( <b>EEA</b>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA. <p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented: <ul><li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</ul> <ul><li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</ul> <ul><li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may securely transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield.</ul> <p>&nbsp;Please contact us if you want further information on how we transfer your personal data out of the EEA.&nbsp;  <p>  <dt class=faq__question> <h3>Data Security</h3>  <dd class=faq__answer> <p> <p>A lot of the information we receive reaches us electronically, originating from your devices, and is then transmitted by your relevant telecoms network provider. <br> <br> Where it's within our control, we put measures in place to ensure this 'in flight' data is as secure as it possibly can be. <br> <br> Once it arrives at Morrisons, you can be sure we take the security of your information very seriously. <br> <br> We use appropriate procedures and technical security measures (including strict encryption, anonymisation and archiving techniques) to safeguard your information across all our computer systems, networks, websites, mobile apps, offices and stores. <br> <br> In particular, we follow the internationally recognised security standard including the Payment Card Industry's Data Security standards (PCI-DSS). <br> <br> We use secure means to communicate with you where appropriate, such as 'https' and other security and encryption protocols. <br> <br> If you have any concerns about the security of your own personal computers and mobile devices, we suggest you read the advice of ‘Get Safe Online’, which can be accessed <a href="https://www.getsafeonline.org/">here</a>. <p>  <dt class=faq__question> <h3>How long do we keep your information for?</h3>  <dd class=faq__answer> <p> <p>To make sure we meet our legal data protection and privacy obligations, we only hold on to your information for as long as we actually need it for the purposes we acquired it for in the first place. <br> <br> In most cases, this means we will keep your information for as long as you continue to shop with us or use our services, and for a period of time afterwards if you stop doing so just in case you begin shopping with us again. <br> <br> After that we will either delete it or anonymise it so that it cannot be linked back to you. <br> <br> Please note that for our Morrisons More mobile app, in order to be able to provide you with the best and most appropriate offers, promotions, product information and content, we need to build up a profile of what you like and dislike and what you may have previously been interested in. As part of this, we retain all data that you choose to delete from the app (such as a previous shopping list) for a limited time. We use it to compare your deleted data with the data you currently store so that we can work out what you are no longer interested in. By doing so we help ensure that the app content and the offers and promotions we show you are as relevant to you as possible. We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, for example for any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes. <p>&nbsp;In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <i>Request erasure</i> below for further information. <p>&nbsp;In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. <p>  <dt class=faq__question> <h3>Rights of access, correction, erasure, and restriction</h3>  <dd class=faq__answer> <p> <h3>Your duty to inform us of changes</h3> <p>It is important that the personal information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your personal information changes by keeping your details up to date on your More Card and online shopping accounts. <h3>Your rights in connection with personal information</h3> <p>Under certain circumstances, by law you have the right to: <ul><li> <strong>Request access:</strong>&nbsp;To your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal information we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</ul> <ul> <ul><li> <strong>No fee usually required:&nbsp;</strong>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</ul> </ul> <ul> <ul><li> <strong>What we may need from you:&nbsp;</strong>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</ul> </ul> <ul> <ul><li> <strong>Time limit to respond:&nbsp;</strong>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.&nbsp;</ul> </ul> <ul><li> <strong>Request access:</strong>&nbsp;Of the personal information that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate information we hold about you corrected. We may need to verify the accuracy of any new data you provide to us.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Request erasure:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal information where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal information where you have exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.&nbsp;</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Object to processing:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which means we can continue to process your personal information.</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Request the restriction of processing:</strong>&nbsp;Of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: <ul><li>(a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; <li>(b)&nbsp;where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; <li>(c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or <li>(d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.&nbsp;</ul> </ul> <ul><li> <b>Request the transfer:</b>&nbsp;Of your personal information to another party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.&nbsp;</ul> <ul><li> <strong>Right to withdraw consent at any time:&nbsp;</strong>Where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</ul> <h3>Fees for excessive or unreasonable requests</h3> <p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal information (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request for access is unfounded or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with the request in such circumstances. <h3>What we may need from you</h3> <p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access the information (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is another appropriate security measure to ensure that personal information is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  <p>  <dt class=faq__question> <h3>Data Protection Officer</h3>  <dd class=faq__answer> <p> <p>The Morrisons Data Protection Officer (DPO) oversees compliance with this privacy notice.
