<p>We may disclose Personal Data to the following types of third parties:</p>
<p><em class="underline">Referrals</em><br>
We share your name, address, telephone number, and other contact details with the member, if any, who referred you to our website. You have the ability to control referral sharing in your account privacy settings. For EU persons, referral sharing is turned off by default. </p>
<p><em class="underline">Service Providers</em><br>
We may share Personal Data with our contracted service providers, such as billing or payment processors, so that these service providers can provide services on our behalf; traffic tracking and targeted advertising services, which may enable us to show you ads after you leave our site; and technical providers who help us diagnose technical problems and administer our site so that we can constantly improve our services. Unless described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade any information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>

<p><em class="underline">Partners and Affiliated Businesses Not Controlled by Us</em><br>
We may partner with other companies to jointly offer products or services.

Other than as described above, we do not permit third parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities when you use our website and related services.

<p><em class="underline">Targeted Advertising.</em><br>

<p>We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy; third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
<h4 id="3-2">3.2. EU Persons</h4>
<p>Persons located in the EU have specific rights granted to them under the General Data Protection Regulation and national implementing laws, regulations, and secondary legislation.</p>
<p><em class="underline">Limited Processing</em><br>
We limit the processing of Personal Data of persons in the EU (&ldquo;EU Personal Data&rdquo;) to that which is relevant for the purposes of the particular processing. We do not process EU Personal Data in ways that are inconsistent with the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized by you. </p>
<p>In addition, to the extent necessary for these purposes, we take reasonable steps to ensure that the EU Personal Data we process is reliable for its intended use, and accurate, complete and current. In this regard, we rely on you to update and correct EU Personal Data to the extent necessary for the purposes for which the information was collected or subsequently authorized. You may contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#b1c1c3d8c7d0d2c8f1dcc8ddd4d0d5c2c8c2c5d4dcc1c3de9fd2dedc" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="2c5c5e455a4d4f556c415540494d485f555f5849415c5e43024f4341">[email&#160;protected]</span></a> to request that we update or correct relevant EU Personal Data.</p>
<p>Subject to applicable law, we retain EU Personal Data in a form that identifies or renders you identifiable only for as long as it serves a purpose that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by you.</p>
<p><em class="underline">Notice and Consent</em><br>
If we decide to process EU Personal Data for purposes other than what is necessary to provide services to you or where we believe that your interests may override ours, persons in the EU will receive a notice detailing:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>the type of Personal Data to be processed;</li>
<li>the purpose for the processing and a description of how the processing is based on legitimate interests;</li>
<li>the categories of recipients of disclosures of the Personal Data;</li>
<li>the period for which the Personal Data will be stored or the criteria for determining the period;</li>
<li>how Customers and Site Visitors can exercise the rights of access, correction, erasure, objection, and the right to withdraw consent;</li>
<li>the right to file a complaint with an EU Data Protection Authority;</li>
<li>whether the Customer or Site Visitor is obliged to provide the data by statute, contract, or for another reason, and the possible consequences of failing to provide the data; and</li>
<li>whether the Personal Data will be subject to automated processing and, if so, the logic and the consequences of the processing for the data subject.</li>
</ol>
<p>Such notices will be clear, conspicuous, and readily available to affected EU Persons. A notice will require an unambiguous, affirmative, opt-in consent to the particular use or processing of the EU Personal Data.</p>
<p><em class="underline">Transfers of Personal Data</em><br>
With respect to transfers of your Personal Data to third-party data processors, we will:</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>enter into a contract with each relevant data processor;</li>
<li>transfer Personal Data to each such data processor only for limited and specified purposes;</li>
<li>ascertain that the data processor is obligated to provide the Personal Data with at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by applicable law;</li>
<li>take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the data processor effectively processes the Personal Data in a manner consistent with our obligations under applicable law;</li>
<li>require the data processor to notify us if the data processor determines that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by our contract or applicable law; and</li>
<li>upon notice, including under (e) above, take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing of the Personal Data by the data processor.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="3-3">3.3. Access</h4>
<p>You generally have the right to access your Personal Data. Accordingly, where appropriate, we provide you with reasonable access to the Personal Data we maintain about you. We also provide you a reasonable opportunity to correct, amend, or delete your information.</p>
<p>We may limit these opportunities where the burden or expense of honoring a request would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of persons other than you would be violated. Other reasons for denying requests or limiting access include (i) interference with the execution or enforcement of the law or with private causes of action, including the prevention, investigation, or detection of offenses; (ii) breaching a legal or other professional privilege or obligation; and (iii) prejudicing security investigations or grievance proceedings or in connection with succession planning and corporate re-organizations.</p>
<p>Please contact <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1464667d6275776d54796d78717570676d6760717964667b3a777b79">[email&#160;protected]</a> to request access to your Personal Data. If access cannot be granted, we will respond with a reason for denying your request.</p>
<h4 id="3-4">3.4. Grievance procedure</h4>
<p>You may file a complaint concerning our processing of Personal Data by email at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#fe8e8c97889f9d87be9387929b9f9a8d878d8a9b938e8c91d09d9193" target="_blank"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="0c7c7e657a6d6f754c617560696d687f757f7869617c7e63226f6361">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>. If a failure to comply with this Privacy Policy or other obligations, we will take steps to remedy the issue.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="4">4. Control and Security</h3>
<p>We take measures to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of your information. We carefully limit access to the database in which your personal information is stored. Additionally, we share and transfer your personal information only in the ways set forth in this privacy policy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk.
