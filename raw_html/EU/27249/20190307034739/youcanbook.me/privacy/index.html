And we will try and only contact you on things you actually care about.</li><li>Our server infrastructure is provided by Amazon Web Services and is currently based in the United States (although servers may from time to time be based in other countries).</li><li>All our servers and applications run the same security protocols that banks use to transmit financial data.</li><li>We only hold your data because you have given it to us - if you don't want us to do that, we won't. If you are worried about it - don't collect or send any sensitive data through our system. You have control over how long we keep data for, and when you want us to automatically delete it.</li><li>We will hold you to the same standards in how you treat data that is collected on our systems - we operate a robust <a href='/terms/'>acceptable use policy</a> which means if we feel you are not treating user data properly, we will hold you to account, and may delete your account.</li><li>We are law-abiding citizens, and comply with all the laws that apply to us - that means, if you want to use our service, you have to too :-) Check out our terms and conditions for more about this.</li></ul><p>If you have any questions at all about the rest of this - please email me, Bridget Harris (the CEO) at <a href='mailto:bridget@youcanbook.me'>bridget@youcanbook.me</a></p><p>Enjoy!</p> </div> </div> <div class="container termsContainer"><h1>YouCanBookMe Ltd Privacy and Data Protection Notice</h1><ol start="1"><li><strong>General</strong><ol start="1"><li>YouCanBookMe limited ("we" or "us") take the privacy of your information very seriously. Our Privacy and Data Protection Notice is designed to tell you, the user of our availability and booking service ("Service") about our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal and other information about you or your business that may be provided via this website or collected through our booking form or otherwise.</li><li>This policy applies to information provided by our members and account holders ("members") and also applies to information which is processed by us when a person (referred to for convenience as a "Customer") books an appointment or submits data using our Service.</li><li>YouCanBookMe limited is registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 (the "Act") and from 25 May 2018 the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li><li>Important Note: If you are using our Service to make a booking with our member or account holder ("account holder") please note that we are a processor of that data but we are not the data controller. We will pass the data you provide onto our account holder in accordance with this policy.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Our Policy</strong><ol start="1"><li>We aim to limit our interaction with your data wherever possible. We have a general policy relating to access to your data. We will generally seek only to access that data which is necessary in accordance with the privileges you have granted to the system. Automated processes may scan your data, but only for an explicit purpose to do with the management of your bookings or delivery of other services. When working with data that was originally collected by us, our processes may need to scan and manipulate the information in order to deliver our service to you. We have systems in place which allow you to limit and control the access you allow to your calendar data.</li><li>However when working with data or content that was not collected by us and which originated elsewhere (e.g. private information you may have entered on your calendar) our policy is to only access and process a limited amount of outline data which we need to deliver the service to you (e.g. your 'free/busy' times). We will not review and analyse content. Occasionally, to assist with troubleshooting problems you are experiencing with the system, we will seek your permission to access your data. Our policy is always to minimise the instances that this occurs, judge the necessity on a case-by-case basis, not to automate this process and only to do so with the knowledge and permission of the owner of the data.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Basis on which we process personal data</strong><ol start="1"><li>Personal data we hold about you will be processed either because:<ul><li> you have consented to the processing for the specific purposes described in this notice;</li><li> the processing is necessary in order for us to deliver our Service (i.e. to comply with our obligations under the contract between us and our account holder); or</li><li> the processing is necessary in pursuit of a &ldquo;legitimate interest&rdquo;, a legitimate interest in this context means a valid interest we have or a third party has in processing your personal data which is not overridden by your interests in data privacy and security.</li></ul></li></ol></li><li><strong>Personal data we collect</strong><ol start="1"><li>We may collect and process the following personal information or data (information that can be uniquely identified with you) about you:<ol start="1"><li>log-in details and information you provide as an account holder when you register with the Service (Log-In Information);</li><li>contact information we collect from you as an account holder about you or your employees (for example, names, addresses, contact addresses, telephone numbers and email address provided to us by you or by your employer) (&ldquo;Contact Information&rdquo;);</li><li>any information which is contained in any third party calendar account (e.g. Google Calendar account) which you have linked with your YouCanBook.me account (but please note our general policy in paragraph 2.1 above) (&ldquo;Calendar Information&rdquo;)</li><li>a record of the bookings made through the Service and information relating to each individual booking (time, location etc.) (&ldquo;Booking Information);</li><li>a record of any correspondence between you and us and other interactions with the Service or the Site (&ldquo;Correspondence Information&rdquo;)</li><li>information which may be provided to our account holder using an online booking form (&ldquo;Booking Form Information&rdquo;) ;</li><li>information relating to payment transactions which is collected where we collect payment on behalf of our account holder (but we do not collect credit card information which is sent directly from the user to our payment processor) (&ldquo;Payment Information&rdquo;)</li><li>information we may require from you when you report a problem or complaint (&ldquo;Complaints Information&rdquo;)</li><li>details of your visits to the Site, the resources and pages that you access and any searches you make (&ldquo;Technical Information&rdquo;).</li></ol></li><li>We only collect such information when you choose to supply it to us.

We will not seek to access nor will we process any data other than data specifically relating to our users and payments made via the Site.
