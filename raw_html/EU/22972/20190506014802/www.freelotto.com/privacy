<p><strong> About IP Addresses </strong><br>
PlasmaNet Intl Limited collects IP addresses along with web stats and traffic sources, which does not personally identify our users, to administer the site, analyze site usage/trends, and report aggregate information to our advertisers. This information is also used in your welcome email to confirm that in fact you have registered for FreeLotto and will be used in the event that you dispute registration. In some cases an IP address is specific to your computer. In other cases an IP address is randomly assigned with a block of IP addresses which are assigned by your ISP (internet service provider) every time you log on.    </p>
<p>An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your ISP server. Web servers - the big computers that "serve" up Web pages - automatically identify your ISP by its IP address. </p>
<p> When players request pages from PlasmaNet Intl Limited websites, our servers log and record the players' IP addresses. </p>


<p><strong> Cookies - The PlasmaNet Intl Limited Online Cookies Policy </strong><br></p>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track the activity on our Service and we hold certain information.</p>
<p>
What are cookies? Cookies are small pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your registration, passwords, and references while you're on our site. The use of cookies is an industry standard - you'll find them at most major Web sites. </p>

<p>By "looking" for a cookie our server can determine whether or not you have already registered to play. Cookies help our server to know you are playing, so that you don't need to register each time you play. </p>
<p>Cookies also help us to serve you better. Through the use of cookies we can better understand what information interests you, providing more of what you like and want from FreeLotto® and our advertisers. </p>
<p>You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our Service.</p>
<p> Some examples of how we use cookies: </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Session Cookies.</strong> We use Session Cookies to operate our Service.</li>
<li><strong>Preference Cookies.</strong> We use Preference Cookies to remember your preferences and various settings.</li>
<li><strong>Security Cookies.</strong> We use Security Cookies for security purposes.</li>
<li><strong>Advertising Cookies.</strong> Advertising Cookies are used to serve you with advertisements that may be relevant to you and your interests.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>A cookie lets our computers remember that you've registered, which allows us to speed up your future activities at our sites. Think of it as a membership card. Similarly, the cookie tracks which of our sponsors you've visited so that we can continue to introduce you to new and interesting sponsors. PlasmaNet Intl Limited may use information we collect through cookies for promotional or marketing purposes. Use of cookies to do the record keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you decline cookies, you may have difficulty playing your selections and adversely impact your FreeLotto® experience. We make our cookies available on an anonymous basis to other advertisers and Advertising Networks so that they can serve you ads for products you are interested in. For example, if you expressed interest in buying a new car you may receive ads about cars. However, we DO NOT include personally identifiable information with the cookies. </p>

<p><strong>  Google Analytics</strong><br>
<p>Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website traffic. Google uses the data collected to track and monitor the use of our Service.

</p>

<p><strong>  Pixel Tracking and Remarketing</strong><br>
Pixel tracking is a common online adverting tool, involving the implementation of an invisible pixel tag on a webpage you visit, that is used among other things to target and/or remarket ads (through use of anonymous cookies), compile website usage stats, and measure the effectiveness of advertisements. When employed as a targeting or remarketing tool, the information is collected in an anonymous cookie, which is then used by our advertising to display targeted advertisements to select audiences across the web. For example, if you showed interest in FreeLotto by clicking on our ad in a Google search result, you may be served a FreeLotto advertisement when you visit another website later on. This is made possible through the use of cookies; however, the cookies do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name or address. Some of our business partners (e.g. analytics companies) use cookies and tracking pixels on our site. We have no access to or control over our partners' use of these technologies. To opt out of Google’s use of cookies, visit Google’s Ad Settings: <a  target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads">www.google.com/settings/ads</a>.  </p>

<p>
Google Ads (AdWords) remarketing service is provided by Google Inc.
You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customise the Google Display Network ads by visiting the Google Ads Settings page: http://www.google.com/settings/ads

Google also recommends installing the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on - https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout - for your web browser. Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on provides visitors with the ability to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.

</p>

<p>We may provide paid products and/or services within the Service. In that case, we use third-party services for payment processing (e.g. payment processors).

That information is provided directly to our third-party payment processors whose use of your personal information is governed by their Privacy Policy. These payment processors adhere to the standards set by PCI-DSS as managed by the PCI Security Standards Council, which is a joint effort of brands like Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover.
