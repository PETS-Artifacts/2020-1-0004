<h2 class="MsoNormal cms-headings-h2"><b><span lang="EN">Independent Healthcare Providers – Performance Information</span></b></h2><p>

<span lang="EN">In the interest in providing comparable clinical outcome and performance data to the public across independent sector providers in healthcare, we – like all independent hospital operators – are required by law to provide activity data, including some personal data, as set out in more detail below, for publication by The Private Healthcare Information Network (PHIN).</span></p><p>

<span lang="EN">PHIN is responsible for collecting, processing and publishing information on the quality and cost of privately-funded healthcare in the UK.&nbsp; The publication of this information is intended to:</span></p><ul><li>provide GPs with reliable information to inform their decisions about which providers to choose</li><li>help future patients make informed choices about where to seek treatment</li><li>enable providers of care (hospitals and consultant clinicians) to improve the quality and safety of their services by better understanding their performance by comparison with other providers</li><li>to support regulator information to help identify any causes of concern</li><li>enabling them to target inspections and help ensure safer care for patients.</li></ul><p>

<span lang="EN">Providers must provide to PHIN with details of each episode of care, including a summary </span><span lang="EN">of each record of treatment including; the dates when each patient was in hospital, what treatment was carried out and by whom.</span></p><p>

<span lang="EN">Providers are also required to provide</span><span lang="EN">: patient satisfaction survey data, Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) – patient reported health improvements following treatment and details of any adverse events relating to the patients treated.</span></p><p>

<span lang="EN">Providers are required to provide each patient’s NHS Number (England, Wales or Isle of Man) or CHI Number (Scotland) and a post code of residence. This information can only be used to identify an individual by an approved body (such as an NHS hospital) with access to information linking NHS Numbers with other personal details.&nbsp; PHIN securely submits the patient’s NHS number and discharge date(s) to information authorities such as:</span></p><ul><li>for England, NHS digital;</li><li>for Wales, the NHS Wales Informatics Service;</li><li><span lang="EN">for Scotland, the Information and Statistics Division;</span></li><li>for Northern Ireland, the Health and Social Care Board; and</li><li>for UK-wide mortality data, the Office of National Statistics.</li></ul><p>

<span lang="EN">PHIN will only disclose records of care and personal data to the non-departmental bodies/authorities identified above, as required by law or where there is an overriding public interest, and /or to investigate or prevent fraud.&nbsp; Data Protection Laws give all individuals the right to make a ‘Subject Access Request’ to obtain a copy of any information that any organisation holds about them (as set out in more detail below).&nbsp; As PHIN cannot identify individuals from the data it holds, applicants would need to provide their NHS Number (or equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland) and further proof of identity in order to access any information held.&nbsp; A &pound;10 fee may apply.</span></p>
