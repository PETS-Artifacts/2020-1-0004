	<a href="#definitions">Corus Entertainment Inc. and its affiliates</a> understand and appreciate the concerns that you may have with regard to personal information gathered on our <a href="#sites">Sites</a>.  Corus has adopted this Privacy Policy to provide transparency to you and to ensure the confidentiality of such personal information.  Corus has a separate privacy policy for our <a href="#definitions-kids">Corus Kids Sites</a>, please refer to the <a href="/privacy-policy-kids">Corus Kids Privacy Policy</a> if you are on one of the Corus Kids Sites.
</div>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>We respect your privacy and believe the best way to serve you through a Site is with honesty, accountability and adherence to legal standards. We are extremely sensitive to the issue of privacy and have structured the features of Corus’ Sites to minimize the requirement to collect personal information, and to maximize your control over the collection, use and disclosure of any personal information. </p>
<p>By visiting or interacting with our Sites, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, and your continued use of our Sites indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, you should review this Privacy Policy from time to time to keep informed of such amendments. The most recent date of revision will be indicated prominently at the top of the Privacy Policy.  </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to the Sites where this Privacy Policy is posted, and does not apply to other Sites operated by Corus or third parties. Please read the respective Sites&#8217; terms of use and policies when accessing such other sites or using such third party applications.</p>
<p>Please also make sure to read Corus’ <a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a> as it supplements and forms part of this Privacy Policy. By using the Site you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. If you do not agree to the terms of this policy or any revised Privacy Policy, please do not register as a user or further interact with the Site.</p>
<h2>PRIVACY OF CHILDREN</h2>
<p>We encourage parents and guardian to be aware of and participate in their Children&#8217;s online activities.  Minors (persons under the age of majority in their province or territory of residence) may not use the Site unsupervised and we ask that you do not allow your child to submit any personal information to us. We do not knowingly collect the personal information of minors or Children.  If you believe your child has provided personal information, please contact Corus’ Privacy Office at <a class="externalLink" href="mailto:privacy@corusent.com">privacy@corusent.com</a> and we will delete it.  Parents are requested to review this Privacy Policy and discuss its main features with their children, in a manner that the child will understand.</p>
<p>For more information regarding marketing to children, please visit the <a class="externalLink" href="https://www.the-cma.org/regulatory/code-of-ethics" target="_blank">Canadian Marketing Association’s Special Considerations in Marketing to Children guidelines</a>, Section K of the CMA’s Code of Ethics and Standards of Practice. </p>
<p>There are software programs that allow parents to block certain websites from their kids. Some programs are more flexible than others, so you may want to shop around to find one that you&#8217;re comfortable with. </p>
<h2>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>We may collect two types of information from visitors to the Sites: <a href="#personal-information">Personal Information</a> and <a href="#non-personal-information">Non-Personal Information</a>. The website will collect Personal Information only where it is voluntarily provided by the individual.</p>
<p>Non-Personal Information is any information that cannot be associated with an identifiable individual, such as aggregated statistical information (e.g. the average length of time users spend visiting the site), or other anonymous information, such as the type and version of browser being used to access the website or application.  Your computer and its operating systems, browsers, and memory contain vast quantities of transaction data and records of your use of it.</p>
<p>We may also collect information about you from a social network site you may be a member of or have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience.  In some cases, we will collect psychographic data from third parties that help us better understand our users.</p>
<p>If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our &#8220;feedback&#8221; form through the Site, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide. We may use and display your full name and email address when you send an email notification to a friend through the Site or the social network from which you have connected to the website or application (such as in an invitation, or when sharing your content).</p>
<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION REQUIRED FOR CONTESTS</h2>
<p>You may be able to enter a contest through the Site. If you are 13 years of age and under, we require the consent of a Parent prior to the submission of your personal information. On the online entry form, we ask for personal information such as the entrant’s name and address.

<p>The Site may, from time-to-time, feature forums (such as message boards and chat rooms) which enable our users to communicate with each other. We do not moderate and are not responsible for the content that you or any user posts on any forum on the Site. All Personal Information you post in a forum becomes public information and may be viewed, collected and used by any visitor to the Site, and may expose you to unsolicited messages. This is beyond our control. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you do not post, on any forum, private information about yourself or other individuals.</p>
<h2>LINKING TO OUR BUSINESS PARTNERS’ AND THIRD PARTY CONTENT/WEBSITES</h2>
<p>Please keep in mind that this Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. The Site may provide on-line media streaming and other third party content. Occasionally, the Site may contain links from and to sites operated by other Corus companies, our business partners and other independent third parties whose privacy practices may be different from ours. Once you leave the Site, you may or may not see a new URL in the location bar. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by the privacy policies of those destination websites. Please review the linked website&#8217;s and third party content provider&#8217;s privacy policies, and do not use or further visit these sites if you do not agree with the terms of these policies. The linked websites are not under our influence or control, and we are not responsible for the privacy policies and practices or the content of the websites operated by our business partners or other third parties or the privacy policies and practices or contents of any linked site or subsequent links from that website. </p>
<p>The Site may include social media features, like the Facebook “Like” button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our website, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them.  </p>
<p>This Site may include social media features, like the Facebook “Like” button or may also permit you to link to other social media websites on the Internet (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, among others) (&#8220;Social Media Sites&#8221;).

<h2>”REFER A FRIEND” OR “SHARING” FEATURES</h2>
<p>If you choose to use a referral service to &#8220;tell a friend&#8221; about the website, a specific article or feature on the website, or a contest that is running, we may ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will then send your friend an email on your behalf inviting him or her to visit the relevant webpage or check out the website. We store your friend&#8217;s name and email for a short period for the sole purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of the same email message.
