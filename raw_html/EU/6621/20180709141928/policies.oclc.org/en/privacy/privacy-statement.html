Please refer to the various social media platform privacy statements and terms of service for additional information.</li>

  <p><a href="https://policies.oclc.org/en/privacy/cookie-statement.html">For information about how OCLC uses cookies and other tracking technologies and behavioral advertising click here</a>.</p> 
  <h2>External Links</h2> 
  <p>The Websites contain links to other sites. Such links do not imply OCLC's endorsement or guarantee of the products, information or recommendations provided by any third party.

  <h2>Third party social plugins</h2> 
  <p>Our Services may have integrated third party social plugins, and the use of such plugins results in collection of data by OCLC and could result in the relevant third party recording your interactions, too.

  <h2>Security</h2> 
  <p>We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the protection of your information, and to prevent the loss, misuse, or alteration of that information. However, no method of transmission or storing of electronic personal information is 100% secure; therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of your information.</p> 
  <p>You are also responsible for the security of your account. For example, your password is a component of our security system, and, as such, it is your responsibility to protect it. Do not share your password with any third parties. If your password is compromised, you should change it immediately and contact us.</p> 
  <h2>Retention of Data</h2> 
  <p>We will keep your information as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which information is collected as stated herein; for as long as is necessary for the performance of the contract between you and us, if any; and to comply with legal and statutory obligations, such as in tax, trade and corporate laws.</p>
