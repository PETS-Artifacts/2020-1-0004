</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Laya healthcare may share your data with others in order to provide you with great healthcare and quality benefits; and so as to comply with our legal obligations.

Data Ireland for address verification and/or other partners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also share your Personal Information with hospitals and/or consultants to aid the efficient processing of claims.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are also obligated under the Health (Provision of Information) Act 1997 to provide information to the National Cancer Registry Board, the Minister for Health or a health board, hospital or other body or agency participating in any cancer screening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event you switch to another insurer, we will share your information with the new insurer in accordance with the Health Insurance Act 1994 (Determination of Relevant Increase under section 7A and Provision of Information under section 7B) Regulations 2014 to confirm information that you have provided on taking out a policy with the new insurer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our agents or subcontractors may also have access to your data on a strictly confidential basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to provide you with products and services, this information will be held in the data systems of laya healthcare or by our agents or subcontractors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you request a quote from us, you may receive a phone call or text message and/or email in relation to that quote. If you would prefer not to receive such communications, please contact us to let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do we use data to detect, investigate and prevent fraud?</strong></p>
<p>We may use Personal Information to detect, investigate and prevent fraud, and this may include sharing Personal Information with other insurers and law enforcement agencies. We are committed to detecting and preventing fraud, and other financial crime.&nbsp; We take this commitment very seriously and use Personal Information in a number of ways for this purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if relevant to our relationship with you we may (where permitted by applicable law):</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>submit your Personal Information (including details of any claims you make, for example, details of injuries) so that they appear on registers of claims which are shared between different insurance providers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>search registers of previous claims when assessing a claim</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>share your Personal Information with other insurers and law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are automated decisions made using data?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we use automated decision-making tools (i.e. where a person is not involved in the decision). We typically use these tools when making straightforward decisions about you (for example, in certain claims handling and medical screening processes).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, as part of our business operations, decisions about you are taken using automated computer software and systems.&nbsp; These decisions do not involve human input, and the software and systems apply pre-defined logic programming and criteria to make a decision and assess how we deal with you in connection with the provision of services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we sometimes use automated decision making as part of a process to:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>decide whether an outpatient claim should be paid as requested (for example, if pre-specified criteria are met by responses that you provide, the claim will be paid automatically without the need for additional human intervention)</li>
<li>identify known pre-existing medical conditions to decide whether we can offer life insurance to you and on what terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We provide you with more information in relation to any automated decision processes before or at the time that we intend to make decisions in this way. You have the right in certain circumstances not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Where do we process Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>We may process Personal Information both nationally and internationally. This may include transferring Personal Information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Rest assured, we are committed to protecting and respecting your data protection and privacy rights. We take additional steps to ensure the security of Personal Information when we transfer it outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Depending on the nature of our relationship with you, we will transfer Personal Information to parties located in other countries in the EU an EEA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, we may transfer Personal Information in order to process international travel insurance claims and provide emergency medical assistance services when you are abroad.&nbsp; We may transfer information internationally to our group companies, service providers, business partners, government or public authorities, and other third parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When making these transfers, we will take steps to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected and transferred in accordance with the requirements of data protection law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This typically involves the use of data transfer agreements in the form approved by the European Commission and permitted under Article 46 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (the relevant data protection law). If there is no data transfer agreement in place, we may use other mechanisms recognised by the GDPR as ensuring an adequate level of protection for Personal Information transferred outside the EEA (for example, the US Privacy Shield framework or any framework that replaces it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How do we keep your data secure?</strong></p>
<p>Information security is extremely important to us. Laya healthcare uses appropriate technical, physical, legal and organisational measures, which comply with data protection laws to keep Personal Information secure.&nbsp; If, despite our efforts, you believe that Personal Information is no longer secure, please tell us so that we can resolve any security issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As most of the Personal Information we hold is stored electronically we have implemented appropriate IT security measures to ensure this Personal Information is kept secure.&nbsp; For example, we may use anti-virus protection systems, firewalls, and data encryption technologies. We have procedures in place at our premises to keep any hard copy records physically secure.&nbsp; Our team receive regular training on data protection and information security.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When laya healthcare engages a third party (including our service providers) to collect or otherwise process Personal Information on our behalf, the third party will be selected carefully and required to use appropriate security measures to protect the confidentiality and security of Personal Information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or electronic data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any Personal Information you might have sent to us has been compromised), please contact us immediately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What is the legal justification for our use of data?</strong></p>
<p>We are obliged to advise you on the legal justification we rely on for using your Personal Information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Data protection law seeks to ensure that the way Personal Information is used is fair. We may be required to obtain Personal Information from you to comply with applicable legal requirements, and certain data may be needed to enable us to fulfil the terms of our contract with you (or someone else), or in preparation of entering into a contract with you (or someone else). We may inform you of this at the time that we are obtaining the data from you.&nbsp; In these circumstances, if you do not provide the relevant data to us, we may not be able to provide our products and benefits to you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more sensitive special categories of Personal Information we will rely on either your consent or one or more of the other legal justifications set out in the table below and typically one of the following two additional justifications (however other legal justifications may be available):&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>the use is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity (for example, when a court issues a court order requiring the processing of Personal Information)&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>the use is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis or the provision of health or social care or treatment.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These more sensitive special categories of Personal Information include Personal Information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning an individual’s sex life or sexual orientation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional legal justifications may also be available in the country in which you are based and we may also rely on these justifications from time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Processing of Personal Information relating to criminal convictions and offences is subject to the relevant legal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we rely on our legitimate business interests or the legitimate interests of a third party to justify the purposes for using your Personal Information, those legitimate interests will be set out in a supplemental privacy notice (which is tailored to our relationship with you where this is useful to provide you with a full picture of how we collect and use Personal Information). In any event our legitimate interests will usually be:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>pursuit of our commercial activities and objectives, or those of a third party (such as direct marketing)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>compliance with legal and regulatory obligations, and any guidelines, standards and codes of conduct (such as detecting or investigating fraud or money laundering)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>improvement and development of our business operations and service offering, or those of a third party</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>protection of our business, shareholders, employees and members, or those of a third party (such as ensuring IT network and information security, enforcing claims, including debt collection)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p>analysing competition in the market for our services (such as research, including market research).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may need to collect, use and disclose Personal Information in connection with matters of important public interest, for instance when complying with our obligations under anti-money laundering and terrorist financing laws and regulations, and other laws and regulations aimed at preventing financial crime.&nbsp; In these cases, the legal justification for our use of Personal Information is that the use is necessary for matters of public interest. Additional justifications may also apply depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do we record calls and monitor email communications with us?</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that we can meet the needs of our members we may record telephone calls in an effort to:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>improve the standard of service that we provide by providing our team with feedback and training</li>
<li>address queries, concerns or complaints</li>
<li>prevent, detect and investigate crime, including fraud and money laundering, and analyse and manage other commercial risks</li>
<li>comply with our legal and regulatory obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also monitor electronic communications between us (for example, emails) to protect you, our business and IT infrastructure, and third parties including by:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>identifying and dealing with inappropriate communications</li>
<li>looking for and removing any viruses, or other malware, and resolving any other information security issues</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How long do we keep data for?</strong></p>
<p>We will typically keep your Personal Information for a period of seven years after the expiration date of your policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a regulated financial services institution, there are laws and regulations that apply to us which set minimum periods for retention of Personal Information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>where we hold Personal Information to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation, we will keep the information for at least as long as is required to comply with that obligation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>where we hold Personal Information in order to provide a product or service (such as an insurance policy and claims handling), we will keep the information for at least as long as we provide the product or service, and for a period of seven years after expiry of the policy and the handling of any related claim.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The number of years varies depending on the nature of the product or service provided – for example, for certain insurance policies it may be necessary to keep the Personal Information for several years after the expiry of the policy.&nbsp; Among other reasons, we retain the information in order to respond to any queries or concerns that may be raised at a later date with respect to the policy or the handling of a claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Typically, for consumer insurance products, the retention period is seven years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For further information about the period of time for which we retain your Personal Information, please contact us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are your Personal Information rights?</strong></p>
<p>You have a number of rights in relation to your data, all of which apply in different circumstances:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right of access to Personal Information - you have the right to receive a copy of the Personal Information we hold about you and information about how we use it. This right is applicable at all times when we hold your Personal Information (subject to certain exemptions).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right to rectification of Personal Information - you have the right to ask us to correct Personal Information we hold about you where it is incorrect or incomplete. This right is applicable at all times when we hold your Personal Information (subject to certain exemptions)</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="bullet">Right to erasure of Personal Information - this right is sometimes referred to as 'the right to be forgotten'.&nbsp; This right entitles you to request that your Personal Information be deleted or removed from our systems and records.&nbsp; However, this right only applies in certain circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examples of when this right applies to Personal Information we hold include (subject to certain exemptions):</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>when we no longer need the Personal Information for the purpose we collected it</li>
<li>if you withdraw consent to our use of your information and no other legal justification supports our continued use of your information</li>
<li>if you object to the way we use your information and we have no overriding grounds to continue using it</li>
<li>if we have used your Personal Information unlawfully</li>
<li>if the Personal Information needs to be erased for compliance with law.</li>
<li>&nbsp;Right to restrict processing of Personal Information - you have the right to request that we suspend our use of your Personal Information.&nbsp; However, this right only applies in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where we suspend our use of your Personal Information we will still be obliged to store your Personal Information, but any other use of this information while (subject to certain exemptions) our use is suspended will require your consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You can exercise this right if:</strong></p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>you think that the Personal Information we hold about you is not accurate, but this only applies for a period of time that allows us to consider if your Personal Information is in fact inaccurate</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>the processing is unlawful and you oppose the erasure of your Personal Information and request the restriction of its use instead</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>we no longer need the Personal Information for the purposes we have used it to date, but the Personal Information is required by you in connection with legal claims</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>you have objected to our processing of the Personal Information and we are considering whether our reasons for processing override your objection.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right to data portability - this right allows you to obtain your Personal Information in a format which enables you to transfer that Personal Information to another organisation.&nbsp; However, this right only applies in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have the right to have your Personal Information transferred by us directly to the other organisation, if this is technically feasible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This right will only apply:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>to Personal Information you provided to us</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>where we have justified our use of your Personal Information based on your consent</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>the fulfilment by us of a contract with you</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>if our use of your Personal Information is by electronic means.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right to object to processing of Personal Information - you have the right to object to our use of your Personal Information in certain circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can object to our use of your Personal Information where you have grounds relating to your particular situation and the legal justification we rely on for using your Personal Information is our (or a third party's) legitimate interests. However, we may continue to use your Personal Information, despite your objection, where there are compelling legitimate grounds to do so or we need to use your Personal Information in connection with any legal claims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This right is different where it relates to direct marketing and you can read about how to exercise your right to opt-out of receiving any direct marketing in the 'How can you tell us about your marketing preferences?' section of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also object to the use of your Personal Information for direct marketing purposes at any time (including if we are carrying out profiling related to direct marketing).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rights relating to automated decision making and profiling - you have the right not to be subject to a decision which is based solely on automated processing (without human involvement) where that decision produces a legal effect or otherwise significantly affects you. However, this right only applies in certain circumstances.</p>
<p>This right is not applicable if:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>we need to make the automated decision in order to enter into or fulfil a contract with you</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>we are authorised by law to take the automated decision</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>you have provided your explicit consent to the decision being taken in this way using your Personal Information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right to withdraw consent to processing of Personal Information - where we have relied upon your consent to process your Personal Information, you have the right to withdraw that consent.&nbsp; This right only applies where we process Personal Information based upon your consent.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right to complain to the relevant data protection authority - if you think that we have processed your Personal Information in a manner that is not in accordance with data protection law, you can make a complaint to the data protection regulator.&nbsp; If you live or work in an EEA member state, you may complain to the regulator in that state. This right applies at any time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>Right to provide instructions regarding the management of your Personal Information after your death (only where such right applies under applicable law)</li>
</ul>
<p class="bullet">&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have the right to inform us of instructions on how we manage the Personal Information we hold about you after your death. This right is applicable at all times when we hold your Personal Information (only where such right applies under applicable law).</p>
