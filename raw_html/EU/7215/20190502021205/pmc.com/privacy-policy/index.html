The information you may provide includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Registration or Subscription Information, Communications and Requests from You, and Your Submissions.</strong> </em>When you engage in activities on the Websites such as those above, you may be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, shipping address, and billing information, and we (or third party service providers on our behalf) will collect such information as well as any other content you provide us in engaging in any of the above activities. Information such as your age, date of birth, gender, hobbies or interests may also be requested.</li>
<li><em><strong>Billing and Credit Card Information.</strong> </em>To enable payment for subscriptions to our Publications, our vendors collect and store billing and credit card information. This information may be shared with us, and will only be shared with third parties who perform tasks required to complete the purchase transaction such as fulfilling orders and processing credit cards. We also use third party platforms to process payments for some of our events and summits, and these third party platforms may collect and store billing and credit card information. The processing of your billing and credit card information by these third party platforms are subject to their privacy policies. Some of our Websites may accept billing and credit card information by phone or mail to process payments for advertisements and listings. This information will only be used by us to process the authorized payments.</li>

In addition, as you interact with the Websites, the social networking service may collect information about your activities on the Websites. We recommend you review the information your third party social networking services may make available to us by visiting those services’ privacy policies and/or modifying your privacy settings directly with those services. As noted below, we reserve the right to use, transfer, assign, sell, share and provide access to all information that we receive through these third party social media services in the same ways described in this Privacy Policy. You agree that we shall not be liable for the use by social networking services of any information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(b) Information Automatically Collected As You Access and Use the Websites<br />

We use your IP address for a variety of purpose, including to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic information, and administer our Websites. We may also link this information with your other information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our subscription or usage rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our Websites, customers or others.</p>

Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest.

If you elect to share your information with these social networking sites, we will share information with them in accordance with your election. The terms and conditions of these social networking sites will apply to the information we disclose to them.</p>
<p><strong>(p) Co-Branded Areas.</strong> Some of our Websites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions, registration opportunities for our events and summits and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis (<strong>“Co-Branded Areas”</strong>). Those transactions on the Co-Branded Areas may take place on a Website, or the site of the third party. In either case, the information you provide in connection with the transaction may be collected directly by, or shared by PMC with, the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such Co-Branded Areas. Some of our Websites may offer you the ability to access a third-party site with whom we have a relationship to access both sites through a co-branded registration or password; in that event, your applicable registration information may be collected directly by, or shared by PMC with, the third-party partner. We will notify you at the applicable point of sign up if any such co-branded registration or password practices will be in effect. These third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy policy.</p>
<p><strong>(q) Information You Disclose Publicly.</strong> You may submit photographs, user profiles, written material, music, video, photos, comments and other content, which may include information relating to individual users (collectively, “<strong>UGC</strong>”) on the Websites. We do not control who will have access to the UGC you choose to make public or how they will use it and take no responsibility for ensuring such UGC remains private or is secure. The UGC is not subject to this Privacy Policy. We are also not responsible for the accuracy, use or misuse of any UGC that you disclose or receive through the Websites. Please see our Terms of Use for further information about the terms that govern the UGC you post.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="legal"></a><strong>Legal Grounds for Using (Processing) Your Information<br />
</strong>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described above will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collect it. </p>
<p>We collect information from you:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type:none;">
<ul>
<li>where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e. our Terms of Service),</li>
<li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights)( such as personalizing our services and marketing for example), or</li>
<li>if we otherwise have your consent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the <a href="#contact"><strong>“Contact Us” section below</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><a id="online"></a><strong>Online Analytics and Advertising</strong><br />
<strong>Delivery of Advertising and Other Content.</strong> In addition to ads and content that we serve you directly, PMC may use third party advertising companies and marketing services to serve ads and other content when you visit the Websites and elsewhere on the internet and in other media. We also use analytics services supported by third party companies to perform analytics and track trends. We work with other third parties to provide certain functionalities on the Websites and to improve the effectiveness of the Websites and its content. Those third party companies may use Tracking Technologies to collect and store Usage Information about you and may combine this information with information they collect from other sources. If you access the Websites through a mobile device or app, we may also share your information with mobile carriers, operating systems and platforms. </p>
<p>To provide ads on the Websites, we use a variety of third party advertising service providers, including networks, data exchanges, ad servers, analytics providers and others. The list of third party providers is found in the Section below entitled “Third Party Cookies” <a href="#third"><strong>here</strong></a>. This list may be updated from time to time. These third parties may use technology to send, directly to your Device, the advertisements and links that appear on the Websites. They may automatically receive your IP address, web browser, operating system, and time and location information, geodevice type and device ID when this happens. The third party service providers, as well as the advertisers themselves, may collect and use information about your visits over time and across the Websites and other third party web sites, as well as information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you on the Websites. Third parties may also use information gathered from your usage of the Websites to serve targeted advertisements to you on third party websites and applications. Google is one of the companies that we use to serve advertising and perform analytics on some of the Websites. We and third party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to help implement the above uses of your information.</p>
<p>We also use Google Analytics along with audience data (such as age, gender and interests of users) to help understand users’ visits to the Websites and to optimize the content that we serve to users.</p>
<p>We endeavor to adhere to the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) self-regulatory principles governing interest-based advertising.</p>
<p><a id="adchoices"></a><strong>Your Choices about Ads and Analytics.</strong><br />
To learn more about how to manage your preferences regarding our cookie-based advertising, please see the <a href="#cookiemgmt"><strong>“Cookie Management” section in our Cookie Notice below</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on your mobile device, you may opt-out by adjusting the ad tracking settings on your mobile device. You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising Identifier.” Like the opt-out tools mentioned above for web, these mobile opt-out tools are provided by third parties, and we do not control or operate these tools.</p>
<p>Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties within the Websites even if you opt out of tailored advertising but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or apps.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track</strong>. PMC does not act on “do not track” requests from your browser because, this way, we are able to personalize your experiences on our Websites. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkadvertising.org</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutads.info</a>.</p>
