You may register a user account using your e-mail address or your Facebook or Google+ account. You may choose to add additional information to your account, including your first and last name, birthdate, gender, phone number, home address, work address, and television provider. You may also register a weather station or webcam using your name and location of the station. If we can use information, alone or in combination, to reasonably identify you as an individual, we treat the information as personal data.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">We use personal data that you provide to give you personalized treatment on the Services; to operate the Services; to analyze, improve, enhance and fine tune our products and the Services; and for any other purpose that is permitted by applicable law and consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Information Provided By You.</em> You may also choose to provide us with information, some of which may be personal data, when you interact with the Services in the following ways:</p><ul style=\"line-height: 1.3125rem; font-size: 0.875rem; font-family: inherit;\"><li>Complete a survey—for example, you may choose to provide us an e-mail address so that we can contact you about your survey response;</li><li>Register for a contest, sweepstakes or other promotion —for example, you may provide your telephone and home address and we may be legally obligated to disclose this information if you win;</li><li>Send us an e-mail message or complete an inquiry form to receive additional information–for example, you might e-mail us with a question and we will use your e-mail address to respond to your inquiry;</li><li>Submit a comment, leave feedback, or send us a photo or video—for example, you might submit a cool photo of a weather event you experienced that we may post on the Services so others can enjoy it;</li><li>Report weather or other conditions—for example, you might tell us that the weather in your area is cold or rainy and we may associate that information with your account;</li><li>Send messages using WU mail—for example, if you send a message using WU mail, we will use the information you provide to send the message; and</li><li>Customize the Services—for example, you might set a “home” location so that every time you visit the Services, you are automatically displayed the weather for that home location.</li></ul></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Automatic Collection.</em> We also collect certain information through automated means. Some of the information we collect through automated means may, whether alone or combined with other data, be personal data. For example, we automatically collect:</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">This information helps us to understand, analyze and measure how users use the Services; manage Services’ operations; deliver and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; help diagnose problems; recognize repeat visitors; and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p><ul style=\"line-height: 1.3125rem; font-size: 0.875rem; font-family: inherit;\"><li>Information about your device and device capabilities</li><li>Information about your device operating system</li><li>Information about your browser</li><li>Information about how you use the Services</li><li>Your activities on the Services</li><li>IP address</li><li>Advertising identifiers</li><li>Mobile or Internet Carrier</li><li>Browser type</li><li>Browser identifier</li><li>Referring URL</li></ul></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Location Information.</em> We also collect location information through the Services so that we can offer you certain location-based services (such as severe weather alerts through our mobile applications), provide advertisements that are relevant to your geographic location, and conduct analytics to improve the Services. The way in which we collect location information is different depending on whether you are accessing the Services through a website or a mobile application.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">If you are accessing the Services through the Sites, we use various technologies, including HTML5, to detect your location so that we can automatically show you the weather for your area, rather than some random location. Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected and you must manually enter your location.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">If you are accessing the Services through one of our mobile applications, the way we collect location information will differ depending on your mobile device’s operating system. If you decline to allow location information collection, your location is not collected and you must type in a location or zip code to see the weather for that location or zip code.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">In the event you allow location information collection through your mobile device, we may collect precise geographic location information. Whether we can collect precise location information is controlled by your device’s operating system. Our collection methods include GPS, cellular network location and other location-based services. Depending on your mobile device’s operating system, we typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time, but the precision of latitude and longitude varies greatly and is determined by various factors controlled by your device or mobile service provider. You can turn off location collection through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">If you opt to allow the Wunderground or Storm mobile applications to collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This allows us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling and deliver you advertisements tailored to your current location. We also use this location information to conduct analytics and improve the Services. You can turn off continuous location collection at any time through your device settings or by deleting the Wunderground or Storm mobile applications.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">Turning off location-based services in either The Wunderground mobile application or Storm mobile application also will disable certain other aspects of the Services, such as location-based severe alerts. However, you may still receive alerts for any location that you entered into one of our mobile applications.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Alerts and Notifications.</em> Certain Services offer you the ability to receive weather-related updates via e-mail, text message, or push notification. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your e-mail address, phone number, device information, and mobile carrier information, in addition to the postal code or geographic area to which the alert, update or notification pertains. If you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the alert settings of your user account. You may also opt out through the settings on your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Other Types of Information We Collect.</em> If you choose to use the feature that allows you to e-mail parts of the Services to a friend, we collect and use your and your friend’s e- mail addresses temporarily to send the e-mail due to technical requirements. This information is not used for any other purpose.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Special Note about Content Submissions.</em> The Services may from time to time offer areas where you and other users can post or otherwise submit information, photos, videos, graphics, creative suggestions, ideas, notes, concepts, information, ratings or other materials on or to the Services (collectively, “<strong>Submissions</strong>”).

Some cookies on our Services collect IP and Mac addresses, which may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognize a user’s device. If you have registered for a user account on the Sites, these cookies may let us know who you are, may be necessary to access your account information, and may provide us and our service providers with information that we will use to personalize the Services in accordance with your preferences.

A pixel tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), which is ordinarily not visible to users and may be associated with cookies on users’ hard drives. A pixel tag allows us to understand which pages you visit on the Services and are used to help us optimize and tailor the Services for you and other future visitors to the website. Web beacons allow third parties to obtain information, such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the web beacon appears, the URL of the page on which the web beacon appears, the time the page containing the web beacon was viewed, the type of browser used to view the page, and the information in cookies sent by the third party.</p></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><strong>Local Storage:</strong> We use local storage, such as HTML5 Local Storage, to enhance user experience by, for example, storing your user preferences and settings (e.g., volume/mute) in connection with animated content on the Services. Local storage is similar to browser cookies but can store data more complex than simple text. By itself, local storage cannot do anything to or with the data stored on your device. Like cookies, local storage can only access personal data that you have provided on the Services.</p></li></ul></li><li><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\"><em>Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Other Technologies by Advertisers, Ad Networks, and Ad Servers</em></p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;\">We adhere to the self-regulatory principles of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“<strong>DAA</strong>”).

These Third-Party Processors include companies that process credit card information, handle shipping for us, and deliver materials to you via e-mail or postal service, for example. We also may provide personal data to third-party mapping service providers to provide you with map content for the Services. Third-Party Processors are authorized to use the personal data that we provide to them only to carry out the service they are providing for us.

In this case, we do not share your information with the third-party sponsors - we do the e-mailing for them. You will always have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future offers by following the unsubscribe link included with each of our e-mails. In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically-identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with those specific third parties to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested.

In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer. In that case, the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-e-mail opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices.

You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off. By proceeding with these interfaces, you allow the Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites’ and services’ terms of use and privacy policies. Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to the Services.

Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected and you must manually enter your location.</p><p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;&quot;>If you are accessing the Services through one of our mobile applications, the way we collect location information will differ depending on your mobile device’s operating system.

Depending on your mobile device’s operating system, we typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time, but the precision of latitude and longitude varies greatly and is determined by various factors controlled by your device or mobile service provider. You can turn off location collection through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device.</p><p style=&quot;margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;&quot;>If you opt to allow the Wunderground or Storm mobile applications to collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection.

For example, we automatically collect:</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">This information helps us to understand, analyze and measure how users use the Services; manage Services’ operations; deliver and measure the effectiveness of advertisements; help diagnose problems; recognize repeat visitors; and facilitate your access to and use of the Services.</p><ul style="line-height: 1.3125rem; font-size: 0.875rem; font-family: inherit;"><li>Information about your device and device capabilities</li><li>Information about your device operating system</li><li>Information about your browser</li><li>Information about how you use the Services</li><li>Your activities on the Services</li><li>IP address</li><li>Advertising identifiers</li><li>Mobile or Internet Carrier</li><li>Browser type</li><li>Browser identifier</li><li>Referring URL</li></ul></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;"><em>Location Information.</em>&nbsp;We also collect location information through the Services so that we can offer you certain location-based services (such as severe weather alerts through our mobile applications), provide advertisements that are relevant to your geographic location, and conduct analytics to improve the Services. The way in which we collect location information is different depending on whether you are accessing the Services through a website or a mobile application.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">If you are accessing the Services through the Sites, we use various technologies, including HTML5, to detect your location so that we can automatically show you the weather for your area, rather than some random location. Depending on browser type, your browser may inform you that the Sites would like to collect your location and request your permission to do so. If you allow it, location information is then collected and may be stored locally on your device. If you decline the collection of location information, your location is not collected and you must manually enter your location.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">If you are accessing the Services through one of our mobile applications, the way we collect location information will differ depending on your mobile device’s operating system. If you decline to allow location information collection, your location is not collected and you must type in a location or zip code to see the weather for that location or zip code.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">In the event you allow location information collection through your mobile device, we may collect precise geographic location information. Whether we can collect precise location information is controlled by your device’s operating system. Our collection methods include GPS, cellular network location and other location-based services. Depending on your mobile device’s operating system, we typically receive the latitude and longitude of your mobile device, as well as date and time, but the precision of latitude and longitude varies greatly and is determined by various factors controlled by your device or mobile service provider. You can turn off location collection through your device settings or by deleting the mobile application from your device.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">If you opt to allow the Wunderground or Storm mobile applications to collect location information while the mobile applications are running in the background, you will enable continuous location collection. This allows us to send you severe weather alerts for the area in which you might be traveling and deliver you advertisements tailored to your current location. We also use this location information to conduct analytics and improve the Services. You can turn off continuous location collection at any time through your device settings or by deleting the Wunderground or Storm mobile applications.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">Turning off location-based services in either The Wunderground mobile application or Storm mobile application also will disable certain other aspects of the Services, such as location-based severe alerts. However, you may still receive alerts for any location that you entered into one of our mobile applications.</p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;"><em>Alerts and Notifications.</em>&nbsp;Certain Services offer you the ability to receive weather-related updates via e-mail, text message, or push notification. To provide these Services, we may need to collect your e-mail address, phone number, device information, and mobile carrier information, in addition to the postal code or geographic area to which the alert, update or notification pertains. If you no longer wish to receive these notifications, you may opt out by turning them off within the alert settings of your user account. You may also opt out through the settings on your mobile device or the particular Service for which you registered.</p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;"><em>Other Types of Information We Collect.</em>&nbsp;If you choose to use the feature that allows you to e-mail parts of the Services to a friend, we collect and use your and your friend’s e- mail addresses temporarily to send the e-mail due to technical requirements.

In other instances, we provide you with the opportunity to receive products and services directly from specifically-identified third parties through the Services. In these instances, you must explicitly consent to receive each offer. When you explicitly agree to receive offers from specific third parties, your information is shared with those specific third parties to enable them to provide you with the offer you have requested. We are not responsible for the information collection practices of these third parties, and all information provided is governed by the privacy policies of these third parties. You should review the privacy policies of these third parties before supplying personal data to them.</p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;"><em>Other Websites, Other Services, Plug-Ins and Links.</em>&nbsp;Like many websites on the Internet and other Internet-based services, the Services may link to webpages located on websites or services maintained by various other entities. In some cases, you may navigate to pages of other websites that are framed with elements of the Services such as in the header or footer. In that case, the URL will identify the site you are visiting. In other cases, such as advertisements, you will be connecting to another site or service when you click on or otherwise activate those opportunities, including click-to-call, click-to-text, and click-to-e-mail opportunities. These other sites and services are not bound by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for their information collection practices. The privacy policies of other organizations may differ from ours, for example, with respect to the level of security, use of cookies, and collection, use and disclosure of personal data.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">Some of the Services allow users to interface with other websites or services, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Pinterest, and Gigya. For example, plug-ins, such as Facebook’s “Like” button, “Comments” and “Facebook Connect” can connect Facebook, Twitter or other third party services identifiable by their respective logos to the Services. You will remain logged in to those other sites and services until you log off. By proceeding with these interfaces, you allow the Services to access your information on those other sites and services, and you are agreeing to those other sites’ and services’ terms of use and privacy policies. Once you log into those other sites and services, the content you post on those other sites and services may also post to the Services. Your use of those other sites and services is subject to the privacy policies of those sites and services, and not this Privacy Policy.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;">Some of the Services use third-party operating systems, platforms, communication services, devices, and software elements (such as mobile device operating systems, wireless services, mobile phone and tablet devices), and some of the Services are provided by third-party distributors, device makers, device operators, platform operators, and communication services. We do not control these third-party entities, products and services, and they may collect, use, process, transmit and disclose your information. For example, these third-party entities, products and services may gather information from the Services in a manner that overrides your settings and preferences in the Services. As we do not control of these third-parties’ data handling practices, we recommend that you review their privacy policies, terms of use and license agreements (if any).</p></li><li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.625rem; line-height: 1.3125rem; font-family: inherit;"><em>Purchase or Sale of Businesses.</em>&nbsp;We continually look for ways to improve our business, including purchasing a business or selling all or part of our business.
