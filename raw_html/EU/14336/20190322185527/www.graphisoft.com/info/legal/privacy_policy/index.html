    <p><b>DEFINITIONS</b></p>
    <p><u>What constitutes as “personal data”?</u></p>
    <p>“Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”); an
        identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an
        identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors
        specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural
        person.</p>

    <p><u>What is data processing?</u></p>
    <p>“Processing” means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal

        making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
    
    <p><u>Who is the data controller?</u></p>
    <p>“Controller” means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with
        others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such

    <p><u>Who is the data processor?</u></p>
    <p>“Processor” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on
        behalf of the controller.</p>

    <p><u>Who is a third party?</u></p>
    <p>“Third party” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or body other than the data subject,
        controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to
        process personal data.</p>
    
    <p><u>Who is a recipient?</u></p>
    <p>“Recipient” means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data
        are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the

        rules according to the purposes of the processing.</p>
    
    <p><u>What is a consent?</u></p>
    <p>“Consent” of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data
        subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the
        processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p>
    
    <p><u>What is a data breach?</u></p>
    <p>“Personal data breach” means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss,
        alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.</p>
    
        
    
    <h3>1. BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE DATA CONTROLLER</h3>
    
    <h4>1.1 Data controller/processor</h4>
    <p>This Privacy Policy regulates the data processing by GRAPHISOFT, and it is therefore GRAPHISOFT who generally
        qualifies as data controller in respect of your personal data. There are however certain cases where GRAPHISOFT
        does not act as a data controller but instead acts as a subordinate of another data controller, which case
        GRAPHISOFT is understood to be a data processor (acting on behalf of another controller while processing the
        personal data – in such case GRAPHISOFT proceeds in accordance and based on the instructions of the data controller
        and processes data only to the extent as prescribed by the data controller).</p>
    <p>Please also note that GRAPHISOFT operates and provides its services with close cooperation with its subsidiaries
        (GRAPHISOFT GROUP) therefore the electronic systems of GRAPHISOFT (where most of our products are marketed and are
        available) are designed to share the information indicated on the Personal Data Information Sheet(s) within the
        GRAPHISOFT GROUP. Based on this system structure it may occur that the data processed by GRAPHISOFT SE are shared
        with a GRAPHISOFT subsidiary or subsidiaries while being processed or GRAPHISOFT subsidiaries share personal
        information with GRAPHISOFT.</p>
    <p>In all cases internal policies and procedures regulate the access to the databases to ensure that while we aim to
        provide the best service possible all data processing are in compliance with the legal regulations.</p>
    <p>List of GRAPHISOFT subsidiaries and their contact details are available here: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.graphisoft.com/info/where_to_buy/">GRAPHISOFT’s subsidiaries, and distributors</a>.</p>
    
    <h4>1.2 Contact details</h4>
    <p>GRAPHISOFT’s contact details for data protection and privacy related matters are as follows:</p>
    
    <p>Name: GRAPHISOFT SE</p>
    <p>Position: Data Protection Officer</p>
    <p>Email address: <script>email_showup('s<a hp', 'wref=9', 'n"maib', 'blto:j', '2privh', '-acy@o', '6grapz', '.hiso6', 'zft.c8', '0om">t', 'bprivy', 'facy@9', 'xgrap.', 'jhisox', 'hft.cn', '3om</9', '6a>.');</script></p>

    <p>Phone number: <a href="tel:+3614373000">0036 1 437 3000</a></p>

    <h4>1.3 Designation of data protection officer</h4>
    <p>Please note that GRAPHISOFT examined the need to appoint a data protection officer according to Article 37 of the
        GDPR (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the
        protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data,
        and repealing Directive 95/46/EC, <b>GDPR</b>) and drew the conclusion that GRAPHISOFT is not required to
        do so in light of the mandatory appointment criteria, in particular, GRAPHISOFT’s core activities do not include
        processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, their scope and/or their purposes, require regular and
        systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale. However, since GRAPHISOFT has always added considerable
        weight to the privacy of personal data, GRAPHISOFT appoints a data protection officer and dedicated sufficient
        staff, resources to ensure that it is able to discharge its obligations under the GDPR.</p>
    <p>Availabilities of the data protection officer:</p>

    <h4>2.1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES</h4>
    <p>Personal data shall be:</p>
    <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness
            and transparency’)</li>
        <li>collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is
            incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific
            or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with GDPR, not be considered to be
            incompatible with the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);</li>
        <li>adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed
            (‘data minimisation’);</li>
        <li>accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal
            data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified
            without delay (‘accuracy’);</li>
        <li>kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes
            for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the
            personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical
            research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the
            appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights
            and freedoms of the data subject (‘storage limitation’);</li>
        <li>processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
            unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
            technical or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The data controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with the above principles
        (‘accountability’).</p>
    
    <h4>2.2. LEGAL BASIS OF THE DATA PROCESSING – LAWFULNESS</h4>
    <p>Processing shall only be lawful if at least one of the following applies:</p>
    <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific
            purposes – i.e. if you signed a consent form or given your consent via electronic means (pressing consent
            button or link, or giving consent over recorded telephone etc.).</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to
            take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract – i.e. in case you are or want
            to be in a contractual relationship with GRAPHISOFT and the processing of your data is necessary for the
            performance of the contract. Please note that in such case your separate consent is not required, and your data
            is processed as long and to the extent as required for the performance of the contract. </li>
        <li>processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject – i.e. in
            case a EU or national piece of legislation prescribes for GRAPHISOFT to process your data (data of invoices,
            data of customer complaints etc.). Please note that in such case also your separate consent is not required,
            and your data is processed as long and to the extent as required and prescribed by law.</li>
        <li>processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
            person;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
            official authority vested in the controller;</li>
        <li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third
            party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the
            data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.</li>
    </ol>

    <h5>3.2.3 GRAPHISOFT Websites and Applications</h5>
    <p>We collect Technical and Usage Data, including information about how you use our websites and applications with or
        without registration or log-in. We collect information that your browser or device typically sends to our servers
        whenever you use (e.g. input text) on or visit a GRAPHISOFT website, or when a GRAPHISOFT desktop product or
        application feature takes you online (as when you visit Online help). For example, your browser or device may tell
        us your IP address (which may also tell us your location) and the type of browser and device you used. When you
        visit a GRAPHISOFT Website, your browser may also tell us information such as the page that led you to our website
        (referral URL) and the websites you generally visit. To collect this information, GRAPHISOFT may use cookies
        (please see our cookie information notice below) and similar technologies, and our servers may collect similar
        information when you are logged in to the website or application. As mentioned below, you may always refuse or opt
        out of the use of cookies or similar technologies. If you identified yourself or registered at a Website or
        application, this information may be associated with you or if you have not identified yourself or registered at a
        Website or application it will be anonymous.</p>
    
    <h5>3.2.4 Development consultations</h5>
    <p>Consultants participate in the GRAPHISOFT Development Consultation Program ("GDC Program") organized by GRAPHISOFT
        to elaborate and discuss specific development themes in connection with planning a product. When you participate in
        the GDC Program we collect your Identity data, Contact data, also certain Technical and Usage data.</p>
    
    <h5>3.2.5. GRAPHISOFT Forums</h5>
    <p>For certain products and developments GRAPHISOFT provides platforms for users/consultants to share their ideas,
        thoughts, questions etc.</p>
    <p>While you are participating in the Forums your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing the
        relevant program will cause the phpBB software used by GRAPHISOFT to create a number of cookies. The first two
        cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter “user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter
        “session-id”), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB software. A third cookie will be created once you have
        browsed topics within the relevant program and is used to store which topics have been read, thereby improving your
        user experience.<br /><br />The second way in which we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This
        can be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user (hereinafter “anonymous posts”), registering on the
        relevant program (hereinafter “your account”) and posts submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in
        (hereinafter “your posts”).<br /><br />Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely identifiable name
        (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your
        password”) and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter “your email”). Any information beyond your user name,
        your password, and your email address required by the relevant program during the registration process is either
        mandatory or optional. In all cases, you have the option of what information in your account is publicly displayed.
        Furthermore, within your account, you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically generated emails from
        the phpBB software.<br /><br />Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure. However, it is
        recommended that you do not reuse the same password across a number of different websites. Your password is the
        means of accessing your accounts, so please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone affiliated
        with the relevant program, phpBB or another 3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you forget
        your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot my password” feature provided by the phpBB software. This
        process will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the phpBB software will generate a new password
        to reclaim your account.</p>
    
    <h5>3.2.6 GRAPHISOFT Emails</h5>
    <p>Emails we send you, on the basis of your prior written (including electronic means) consent if you are an
        individual, usually include technologies that tell GRAPHISOFT whether you have received or opened the email, or

        emails, you may withdraw your consent at any time and can either opt out of receiving GRAPHISOFT marketing emails

    <p><span class="h4">6.1</span> A cookie is a small piece of information that will be stored on your hard disk until you delete it. Like most
        websites and applications, we use our own cookies and those of third parties, together with similar technologies,
        to make our websites and applications work, to offer you customized and personalized service, and to learn more
        about our users and their likely interests. Cookies themselves don't hold personal information. They only have a
        unique alphanumeric identifier that sits on your browser. And in many cases, we won’t be able to link the
        information we collect by using a cookie back to you. They can, however, enable us to link that information back to

    <p><span class="h4">6.2</span> GRAPHISOFT and third-party vendors including Google and Facebook use first-party and third-party cookies and

        user’s previously recorded activities. GRAPHISOFT does not disclose any personally identifiable information to
        these third-party vendors. However, third-party vendors automatically receive IP addresses when activity tracking
        occurs. GRAPHISOFT may connect user activity data gathered by third-party vendors with information collected by its
        websites and applications and such data may therefore become Profile or Usage Data.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">7.4</span> It is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest to prevent and respond to fraud, to defend our Websites and applications
        against attacks, to protect the property and safety of GRAPHISOFT, our customers, users, the public. That is why
        our distributors and specific companies are retained as data processors to assist us to combat piracy. Please note
        that it is GRAPHISOFT’s legitimate interest from the above reasons not to identify our service providers. We share
        Your IP address, MAC address, software version and language with them exclusively for the above purposes.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">7.5</span> Further to the above as indicated earlier GRAPHISOFT provides its services in close cooperation with its
        subsidiaries therefore it is frequent that a GRAPHISOFT subsidiary acts as data processor on behalf of GRAPHISOFT.</p>

    <h4><em>(B) DISCLOSURE TO OTHER DATA CONTROLLERS</em></h4>

    <p><span class="h4">7.6</span> In other cases, we provide your data to other entities to use such data under their own name and for their own
        benefit. Sometimes we may need to do this to comply with a legal obligation (such as when we need to provide
        certain Transaction, Technical or Identify Data to the police or other authorities), and in other cases, we rely on
        other legal grounds, such as our legitimate interests or your written (including electronic means) consent.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">7.7</span> Accordingly, if you consent to the sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT may also share your
        Identity Data, Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with <a href="https://www.graphisoft.com/info/where_to_buy/"
            target="_blank">GRAPHISOFT’s subsidiaries, and distributors </a> Please note that we do not share personal
        information about consumers with third parties for their own marketing purposes unless the consumer agreed to that
        sharing.</p>
        
    <p><span class="h4">7.8</span> We may share or publish Aggregate Data that doesn’t specifically identify you, such as statistical information
        about visitors to our websites or statistical information about how customers use our applications.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">7.9</span> We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with
        the law and the data processing contract if any. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your
        personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and
        in accordance with our instructions.</p>

    <h4><em>(C) MAKING YOUR DATA PUBLICLY AVAILABLE BY YOU</em></h4>

    <p><span class="h4">7.10</span> There are several places on GRAPHISOFT’s websites and applications that allow you to post comments, upload
        pictures, or submit content for others to see. Sometimes you might be able to limit who can see what you share, but
        there are some places where what you share can be seen by the general public or other members of the website or
        application. Please be careful when you share your personal information. Do not share anything you do not want
        publicly known unless you are sure you are posting it within a website or application that allows you to control
        who sees your post. Please note that when you post messages on certain user forums on our websites and
        applications, your email address or name may be included and displayed with your message.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">7.11</span> To remove content you have shared on our websites and applications, please use the same website or application
        feature you used to share the content. If another user invites you to participate in shared viewing, editing, or
        commenting of content, you may be able to delete your contributions, but usually the user who invited you has full
        control. If you have questions or concerns about this, please <script>email_showup('p<a ht', '_ref=1', 'x"maih', 'mlto:y', '8privd', 'dacy@v', 'jgrapw', '6hisov', 'eft.ct', '-om">u', 'ncont_', 'uact 9', '0us</s', 'ta>1');</script>.</p>
    
    
    
    <h3>8. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h3>

    <p><span class="h4">8.1</span> As indicated above, we share your personal data within the GRAPHISOFT Group and with our Distributors as
        follows:</p>
    <ol class="list-roman">
        <li>You provide us with certain personal data when registering at our Websites. In such case, if you consent to the
            sharing, as indicated above in the table, GRAPHISOFT as data controller may also share your Identity Data,
            Contact Data and Marketing and Communications Data with <a href="https://www.graphisoft.com/info/where_to_buy/"
                target="_blank">GRAPHISOFT’s local subsidiaries and distributor(s) corresponding to your registered address
                who will be data controller(s) too. </a> </li>
        <li>Distributors and subsidiaries use the online ordering system of GRAPHISOFT and when using it may fill in
            certain personal information about you. This is always the decision of the given distributor/subsidiary. In
            such case the distributor/subsidiary is the data controller and GRAPHISOFT is only data processor of the
            distributor/subsidiary in order to provide the electronic ordering system.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These transfers will involve transferring your data outside the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>).</p>
    
    
    <p><span class="h4">8.2</span> Also, since many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>)
        (such as Microsoft, Inc., Digital Ocean, Inc., Salesforce.com, Inc.), so their processing of your personal data
        will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">8.3</span> Whenever we transfer your personal data outside of EEA, we contractually ensure a similar degree of protection
        is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
    
    <ol class="list-alpha">
        <li>we will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of
            protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en">European
                Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries</a>.</li>
    
        <li>(b) where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which
        give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en">European
            Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries</a>.</li>

        <li>(c) where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield
        which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For
        further details, see <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en">European
            Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield</a>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><span class="h4">8.4</span> Please do contact us if you need further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your
        personal data outside of EEA.</p>

    

    <h3>9. IS MY PERSONAL DATA SECURE, AND WHERE WILL IT BE STORED?</h3>
    <p><span class="h4">9.1</span> We understand that the security of your personal information is important. We provide reasonable administrative,
        technical, and physical security controls to protect your personal information. All information you provide us is
        stored on secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access
        certain parts of our websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share
        a password with anyone. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure.
        Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot warrant or guarantee the security of your
        data transmitted to us; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use
        strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. In case your data is provided by
        registering on our websites than we ensure that this registration is completed on a secured platform where we apply
        our security measures. In case you would like to have more information on the specific security measures taken in
        order to save your data than please contact us.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">9.2</span> Also, we have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally
        lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal
        data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will
        only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">9.3</span> Finally, we have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and
        any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>

    <p><span class="h4">9.4</span> Your personal information and data files are stored on GRAPHISOFT’s servers and the servers of companies we hire
        to provide services to us. As shown in clause 7 above, your personal information may be transferred across national
        borders because we have servers located worldwide and the companies we hire to help us run our business are located
        in different countries around the world (for example, Germany, Ireland, the United States). As mentioned in clause
        7 above, the data that we collect from you may therefore be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside
        the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or
        for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order and the
        provision of support services.</p>
    
    <h3>10. HOW LONG WILL GRAPHISOFT HOLD AND USE MY PERSONAL DATA?</h3>
    <p><span class="h4">10.1</span> We only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the
        purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting
        requirements.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">10.2</span> To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we take into account the amount, nature, and
        sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal
        data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other
        means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">10.3</span> Details of retention periods for different types of your personal data are available in the relevant Personal
        Data Information Sheet attached hereto.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">10.4</span> More specifically, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, by law we have to keep basic
        information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for at least 5, in
        certain cases 8 years after they cease being customers for tax, financial auditing, and record keeping purposes.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">10.5</span> In some applicable circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see the clause dealing with ‘Right To
        Erasure’ below for further information.</p>
    
    <p><span class="h4">10.6</span> In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for
        research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to
        you.</p>
