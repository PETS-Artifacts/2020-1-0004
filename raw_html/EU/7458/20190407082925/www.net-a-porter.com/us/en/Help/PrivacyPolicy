    to us, such as your given name and surname and your shipping and billing addresses. We also collect data regarding your shopping habits and the pages and products you have viewed from your use of the website. We use this data to:</p>

<p>Under the Law, we must have a valid legal basis to process your data. In most instances, we will process your data because we have a contract with you e.g. to deliver your purchases or magazine, or to provide you with other services you have requested.
    We will also use your personal data to send you sales and marketing communications that we believe may be of interest to you if we have your explicit consent for this activity, or if you are an existing customer where we have a legitimate interest
    in communicating with you. You can opt out of sales and marketing communications from us at any time.</p>
  <strong>Who will process your data?</strong>
  <p>Your personal data will be processed by THE NET-A-PORTER GROUP LIMITED and YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP S.p.A, as the data controllers, and may also be processed by other Group companies acting under our instructions. </p>

    They will process your data only under our instructions. Some of these suppliers and some Group companies may be based in non-EU countries. Where this is the case, the transfer of your personal data to these countries is carried out in compliance
    with the guarantees provided by law.</p>
  <strong>How long do we keep your data?</strong>
  <p>We will not retain your personal data for longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which you provided that personal data, unless the law permits or requires that we retain it for longer. The retention period varies depending on the purpose
    of the processing. For example, the data collected during your purchase of goods on www.net-a-porter.com are retained in accordance with local tax law (seven years in the UK), while those data used to send you our marketing communications are retained until you ask
    to be unsubscribed.</p>

 <strong>4) What is our legal basis for processing your personal data?</strong>
  <p>Under the Law we must have a valid reason for using your personal data and we may not collect, store or use data about you that is not compatible with that reason. There are four valid reasons for our use of your personal data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most of the data we collect from you is necessary to allow us to fulfil our contract with you or to enter into a contract with you e.g. you provide a billing address and email address when your purchase an item from <a href="www.net-a-porter.com">www.net-a-porter.com</a> so that we can process your payment and send you your order confirmation. </li>
    <li>In certain circumstances we will ask for your permission or consent to use your personal data e.g. if we would like to send you marketing information about items we believe may be of interest to you via email. If you have given your consent to
      our use of your personal data, you are entitled to withdraw this consent at any time.</li>
    <li>We may also have a legitimate interest in using your personal data e.g. to ensure that the content of our website is presented to you and your device as effectively as possible, or to ensure that our marketing communications are relevant to your interests.
      If this is our reason for using your data, we must make sure that our interests do not override yours and you are entitled to object to this use of your data.</li>
    <li>Lastly, we may be required to use your data to meet a legal obligation or to protect your interests e.g. we may exchange data with other specialist organisations for the purposes of fraud detection and credit risk reduction and we will retain
      financial data long term to meet our statutory obligations.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The legal basis for each of the ways in which we use your personal data is as follows:</p>
