<p>We may use information from cookies for the following purposes: </p>
<ul>

   <li>To recognize repeat visitors for statistical/analytical purposes; or</li> 
   <li>Anonymous tracking of interaction with online advertising, for example, to monitor the number of times that a banner ad is displayed and the number of times it is clicked.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We may connect the information that we collect through cookies with other Personal Information that you provide to us. Such purposes are: </p>
<ul>
   <li>To customize or personalize your experience of the Site; for example, so that we can greet you on the site by name;</li>

<p>NET-A-PORTER may use your personal information for the processing of orders, payments and to provide you with a personalized shopping experience. We will also use your details to fulfill and deliver your orders and manage your account. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information. Your personal information may also be shared with other trading divisions within the NET-A-PORTER group. Where there is a legal obligation to do so, we may disclose your information to any relevant regulatory body. </p>
<p>When you register with NET-A-PORTER, you will be offered the opportunity to opt out of our email newsletter and other update services. If you choose to opt-out for this service, we will not send you alerts for new products, features nor enhancements; special offers; upgrade opportunities; contests or events of interest. However, if you choose to receive our emails from time-to-time we will use the information you provide to promote the products and services of our business partners or other companies within the Net-A-Porter Group via email or direct mail. We do collate information about site traffic, sales, wish list, and other commercial information which we may pass on to third parties but this information does not include any information which can identify you personally. We strive to limit use of your information to those offers that we think you would appreciate receiving. Finally, we may use your personal information for our internal marketing and demographic studies, together with non-personal data to monitor customer patterns so we can consistently improve our site design to better meet our visitors' needs. If we change our policy on disclosure to others, we will inform you and give you the choice of opting out. </p>
