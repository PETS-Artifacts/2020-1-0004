 	</div>
 <div id="infoCollected" class="ont-about-anchor"></div>
 	<div>
 		<h2>4. Personal Data collected during registration / payment</h2>
 		<h3>What Personal Information is collected and why?</h3>
 		<p>If You register with the Service You must provide Your name and email address and You will be asked to choose a password for Your account. We use Your Personal Data to maintain Your account for use of the Service. We are entitled to do so under GDPR because we have a contractual relationship with You. This information helps to ensure that Your account is protected and allows 192.com to display private information to You about Your account. Your email address is used as Your Service user name, but it also provides a means of contacting You about Your account.</p>
 		<p>If You pay to access premium services on the Service it will be necessary to provide Your address, credit / debit card details. This enables the card transaction to be processed including checks to prevent unauthorised use of Your credit card by fraudsters. In performing these checks Your Personal Data may be disclosed to a registered Credit Reference Agency which may keep a record of that information. You can rest assured that this is done only to confirm Your identity, that a credit check is not performed and that Your credit rating will be unaffected.</p>
 		<p>Personal Data collected from You during registration / payment will never be published on the Service. It will be retained by us for up to 6 years from your last interaction with the Service in case it is required by regulatory or other authorities.</p>
 		
 		<h3>What will 192.com do with Your email address?</h3>
 		<p>When You register providing an email address 192.com will seek Your consent to send You email containing news, offers and promotions. If you do not wish to receive such email you may opt out at this stage. You can <a href="https://secure.192.com/account/emailPreferences/" title="Unsubscribe to emails">unsubscribe</a> at any time by going to "Your Account", and selecting "change e-mail preferences", or You can write to us at 192.com Customer Services, Unit 8-10 Quayside Lodge, William Morris Way, London, SW6 2UZ; by email at feedback@192.com; or by phone on 08000 887192.</p>
 		<p>Whether or not You opt into receiving this this type of email, we will use your email address to send You messages crucial to the use of Your account - for example, the initial account activation email and password reminders.</p>
 		<p>All email that we send to You utilises performance tracking technology. This means that we can capture information about which emails are sent to You, which emails You have opened, which links in those emails have been clicked, and the dates and times on which those emails have been opened or links in them clicked.</p>
 		<p>We use this information to help us understand which emails are useful to our users.</p>
 	</div>
 <div id="searchLogs" class="ont-about-anchor"></div>

 			</li>
 			<li>
		  		<div class="ont-italic">Category 3 - Targeting cookies</div>
		  		<p>These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to You and Your interests.
