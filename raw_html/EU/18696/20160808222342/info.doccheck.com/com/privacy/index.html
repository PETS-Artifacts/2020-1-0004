			<div class="mobileContentPadding"><p class="bodytext">DocCheck Medical Services GmbH, Vogelsanger Straße 66, D-50823 Köln (&quot;DocCheck&quot;), captures personal data which are necessary for the utilisation of the services and information (&quot;services&quot;) offered as part of the internet platform for specialist medical circles at <a href="http://www.doccheck.com/com" target="_blank">www.doccheck.com</a> as well as the directly related websites (&quot;website&quot;). The protection of such data is guaranteed by state of the art technology. <br />With your consent your personal data are captured, stored and used for the purposes explained in this declaration. You can view and change the data submitted by you in your user account. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time with future effect. &nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Data capturing</b><br />Personal data are captured when you register with DocCheck to obtain your free password and while you use the services offered by DocCheck. <br />When you register you enter your data into the boxes of the application form. Mandatory data are marked as such. These include, for example, first name and surname, date of birth, occupation, specialisation, area of activity, address, type of address, email address. Without these mandatory data DocCheck is unable to verify your affiliation to the respective circles of medical experts. Any proof of affiliation to a circle of medical experts that you submit to DocCheck will be stored online or offline with a link to your user profile. If you choose not to enter such mandatory data you will be unable to use the non-public section of the website and certain services. <br />Utilisation of specific services (e.g. DocCheck Jobs, customer account, DocCheck Pro) requires additional data, such as banking details. These data are also provided by you. If you choose not to enter certain data you may find utilisation of certain services restricted. &nbsp;<br />When you enter your DocCheck password we capture your user ID, you IP address, the ID of partner websites where you have logged in as well as the date. These data are captured for security purposes and kept for two weeks. They are also used to compile anonymous statistics for improving our services. We do not compile personal utilisation profiles which show your individual habits when accessing our websites. The anonymous statistics do not allow conclusions as for the identity of a person.<br /><br /><b>Storage of data</b><br />Personal data are stored on DocCheck’s servers and protected, among others by firewalls, against alterations and interference by unauthorised third parties. Data are exclusively processed within the company and are not handled by any third parties. Documents furnished as proof are stored electronically or as hard copy, depending in which format they were submitted. <br /><br /><b>Utilisation of data</b><br />Your personal data are used when you enter the DocCheck services offered in the non-public section of the website (e.g. community, job market, blogs etc.). Other DocCheck users are then able to see the following data: First name and surname, postal address, date of birth, job title and any other information that you have entered yourself and unblocked for all users. <br /><br />Your personal data are also published outside of DocCheck. You can partially deactivate visibility of your data and their traceability by search engines. In principle, however, such data are publicly accessible and traceable (e.g. your contributions to blogs, your DocCheck Jobs profile and your content in other DocCheck services).<br /><br />Within the DocCheck services your email address is the means to ensure communication between DocCheck and you. After you have registered with DocCheck and furnished proof of your professional capacity we will send you emails containing information on a range of services: health sector news as part of a web magazine (DocCheck News), pharmaceutical and health care sector news and products, including related products and services (DocCheck Business Mail), job offers posted on DocCheck Jobs (DocCheck JobMail), news on new DocCheck protected websites (DocCheck SiteSeeing), services of the DocCheck portal, e.g. DocCheck’s web services, or news on items offered by the DocCheck Shop, on DocCheck Load or DocCheck Pro. Upon registration you agree to receive these emails. Sending the emails, the despatch date, opening of the mails and clicking on links included in the emails is recorded in an anonymous form. These data are deleted after 30 days. Upon registration you agree to participate in certain additional DocCheck services (online surveys, online market research). After registration you are of course free to limit or withdraw your consent. You are able to change your user account settings for participating in these services at any time (<a href="https://www.doccheck.com/com/account/email/settings/" target="_blank">https://www.doccheck.com/com/account/email/settings/</a>). <br />If you want to participate in online surveys or market research your data are used by DocCheck to select potential candidates for a survey or a market research project. Selected candidates are then invited and have to give their explicit consent to participate. If additional personal data are captured, used and stored as part of a study conducted online, such data are evaluated anonymously. Identification of a specific person is not possible. <br />Product information and advertisements may also be delivered by post to the address given by you upon registration. You agree to receive such advertising mail. <br /><br /><b>Passing on of data</b><br />Your personal data will not be passed on or transferred to third parties, whether persons or companies, unless you have consented to such transmission or have instructed DocCheck to do so due to the request by a public authority or due to legal stipulations. <br />When you make use of website services which are offered by third party service providers, data will only be transferred to the extent which is necessary for rendering such services, or if you have explicitly agreed to such transfer. <br />When using the DocCheck Shop, data which is needed to process your order will be transferred to DocCheck Medical Requirements and Logistics GmbH. The data in question are name, address and contact information, i.e. your telephone number. <br />When you participate in online surveys or market research conducted from time to time your personal data will be handed to the respective organiser only in an anonymous form, which will make it impossible to identify any specific person. You will be notified if it is necessary to make your data available for legal reasons (e.g. when participating in case series or reports on side-effects). <br />You need to enter your username and password for registration and utilisation of non-public website areas of pharmaceutical companies which use the DocCheck identification service. This registration procedure takes place on the DocCheck servers and no data are transferred to the respective companies. <br />When personal data have to be made available to such companies as part of your utilisation of their websites (e.g. in “DocCheck staff”), this will take be done only with your explicit consent to transfer the requested data in full or parts thereof. No data are transferred before your consent has been obtained. <br />In the event that electronic publications from the DocCheck Load service are passed on without authorisation, or if suspicions of this kind exist, DocCheck has the right to hand personal user data to the holder of rights if it is necessary for the purpose of instituting legal action. <br /><br /><b>User account</b><br />In your user account you can view the data which you entered for registration at any time. You can also change or delete your data at any time. Deleting your data means that you will no longer be able to use your DocCheck user account or your DocCheck password.<br /><br /><b>Cookies</b><br />Cookies are employed in some places of the public and non-public area of the website. They are tiny identification text files which are installed through your web browser on your computer’s hard disk for the longer term (permanent cookies) or temporarily in the PC’s memory (temporary cookies). Their function is to improve utilisation of DocCheck services or to assist with your further identification after you have logged into the non-public area of the website. Further identification means that you do not have log in repeatedly as you continue using this website area, and your data is kept safe even if you lose your entries into a form of several pages. Apart from that we employ cookies with coded information about     profession, specialisation and area of activity in order to be able     to adapt advertising within the setting of offers of medical     information on DocCheck and other websites to your personal     interests.<br />You can change your browser settings to block the storage of cookies or to receive notification when a cookie is installed. If you allow cookies only within limits or not at all you may not be able to use the full extent of the website or specific services. <br /><br /><b>Google Analytics</b><br />This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics employs cookies, i.e. text files which are stored on your computer. The manner in which you use the website can be analysed with the help of cookies. The information gathered by cookies on your usage of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the US and stored there. If IP&nbsp; anonymization on this website is activated, however, Google will immediately shorten your IP address in the member countries of the European Union and in other countries which have signed the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will a complete IP address be transferred to a Google server in the US and shortened there. If instructed by the operator of this website Google uses the information gathered to evaluate your usage of the website in order to compile reports on website activities and to render further services regarding usage of the site and the internet in general to the operator of the website. The IP address, obtained by Google Analytics from your browser, will not be combined with other Google data. You are able to block the installation of cookies by changing your browser settings accordingly; please note, however, that this may prevent you from having full use of this website. Furthermore you can stop Google Analytics from capturing data (including your IP address) on your website usage and from processing them by downloading and installing browser add-on available on <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=com" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=com</a>.<br />IP anonymization is activated on this website.<br /><br /><b>IVW</b><br />Our website uses the scalable central measurement method (SZM) by INFOnline for establishing statistical parameters for the utilisation of our products. <br />Anonymous readings are captured for this purpose. For recognising computer systems the measurement method for range uses either a cookie with the code&nbsp; ivwbox.de or a signature which combines various pieces of information transferred automatically by your computer. This procedure does not store any IP addresses and processes them only in an anonymous form. Data protection was taken into account when the measurement method for range was developed. The aim of range measurement is to statistically establish the intensity of utilisation and the number of users of a website. Individual users are not identified at any stage. User identity always remains protected. Users do not receive any advertisements through this system. Utilisation statistics for web products which are part of the Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V. (IVW - <a href="http://www.ivw.eu/" target="_blank">www.ivw.eu</a>) [Audit Bureau of Circulations] or participate in the internet facts study conducted by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V. (AGOF - <a href="http://www.agof.de/home.564.en.html" target="_blank">www.agof.de</a>) [online research working group], are published monthly by AGOF and by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V. as well as by IVW and can be viewed at <a href="http://www.agof.de/home.564.en.html" target="_blank">www.agof.de</a>, at <a href="https://www.agma-mmc.de/" target="_blank">www.agma-mmc.de</a> and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ivw.eu/" target="_blank">www.ivw.eu</a>. Apart from publishing measurement data IVW monitors the SZM procedure in terms of utilisation which conforms to rules and data security. INFOnline GmbH operates the SZM procedure. Visit <a href="https://www.infonline.de/" target="_blank">www.infonline.de</a> for more information on SZM, as well as AGOF’s data protection website at www.agof.de/datenschutz and IVW data protection at <a href="http://www.ivw.eu/" target="_blank">www.ivw.eu</a>. You can object to data processing by SZM through <a href="http://optout.ivwbox.de/" target="_blank">this link</a>.<br /><br /><b>Omniture Site Catalyst</b><br />We use Omniture SiteCatalyst™, an analysis service by Adobe Inc. Among others we employ SiteCatalyst to measure and analyse page preferences, traffic patterns on our websites, reference pages and search engines as well as success and drop-out rates of campaigns. For more details on Omniture Site Catalyst see <a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/privacy/analytics.html</a>.

When you enter a site containing a plug-in, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers. Facebook transfers the plug-in content directly to your browser which in turn ties it into the website. By incorporating plug-ins Facebook receives the information that you have entered the respective page of our website. If you are also logged into Facebook at that time, your visit to our site is allocated to your Facebook account. By interacting with the plug-ins (e.g. clicking the “like” button or adding commentary) your browser also transfers that information directly to Facebook, where it is stored. If you want to prevent this you have to log out of Facebook before you enter our pages. <br />For more details on the purpose and extent of data captured by Facebook, how it is processed and used, as well as your rights and possibilities to protect your privacy please see Facebook’s <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">information on data protection</a>.<br />DocCheck has no influence on how your data are captured, processed and used by Facebook.<br /><br /><b>Google+</b><br />We have integrated opportunities for interaction with the Google Plus social network by Google Inc. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA) into our websites, in particular the +1 button which is recognisable by its symbol. When you enter one of our sites containing such a button, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Google servers, and your browser ties the button’s content into the website. Without further interaction Google does not capture your data unless you are logged in with Google+. If you are logged in, Google+ will among other things capture and process/use your IP address and allocate it to your account. The same applies if you actively use the +1 button. <br /><br />For further details and comprehensive information on the purpose and extent of data capturing, processing and utilisation by Google, as well as the possibilities of how to arrange your settings for privacy please see <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">www.google.com/intl/com/policies/privacy/</a>.<br />DocCheck has no influence on how your data are captured, processed and used by <br />Google+.<br />If, as member of Google+, you want to prevent that Google captures your data and allocates such data to your Google+ account when you enter one of our internet pages bearing a +1 button, you have to log out of Google+ before you enter our website. <br /><br /><b>Twitter</b><br />Our webpages also contain functions of the Twitter service operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom Street, Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. They are recognisable by the Twitter symbol.<br />When you enter our websites while using Twitter functions our sites are allocated to your Twitter account and published there, transferring additional data to Twitter. DocCheck has no influence on this data transfer. <br />See <a href="http://www.twitter.com/" target="_blank">www.twitter.com</a> for more information on the possibilities of how to arrange your settings for the Twitter utilisation/link. <br /><br /><b>Cancellation right</b><br />You have the right to withdraw your consent to the utilisation of your personal data, stored by DocCheck, at any time with future effect. Send your cancellation to <a href="mailto:info@doccheck.com" class="mail">info@doccheck.com</a>.<br />Your data will be deleted immediately unless storage and utilisation of certain data is permitted in order to render a service or process an order or as a result of legal stipulations. <br /><br /><b>Changes to this privacy declaration </b><br />DocCheck reserves the right to change this privacy at any time, while adhering to legal stipulations, and if necessary will make such changes public in a suitable manner. <br />If necessary, DocCheck may also ask for your consent to change this privacy declaration. <br /><br />Last update: 17 June 2012</p></div>
