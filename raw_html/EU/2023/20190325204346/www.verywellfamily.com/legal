<div class="expert-content">
<p>When it comes to your health, you need to feel not only confident about the choices you make, but the information that helps you make them. That’s why we feel it’s important to share how we go about doing what we do—from how we create and ensure the accuracy of our content to who’s behind it and more.</p>
<p>The following governs all <a href="https://www.verywell.com/">Verywell</a> properties, including <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/">Verywell Health</a>, <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/">Verywell Fit</a>, <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/">Verywell Mind</a>, and <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/">Verywell Family</a>. If you have any questions or comments, please reach out to us by emailing <a href="mailto:feedback@verywell.com">feedback@verywell.com</a>.</p>
<p>Verywell is part of the <a href="https://www.dotdash.com/">Dotdash</a> publishing family.
<h3>Principles</h3>
<p>Every piece of content across Verywell’s sites is conceived and created with these core principles in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Our readers come first:</b> Every article is published because we feel, based on professional expertise and audience data, that it will help you better understand your health. New content ideas are inspired by current research, medical advances, guideline changes, incidence rates, trends, and more.</li>
<li><b>Reliable information is power:</b> We root our content in trusted research that reflects the current understanding of the medical and wellness expert communities so you can feel empowered to make decisions for you and your loved ones.</li>
<li><b>Inclusivity:</b> While content is written for a primarily U.S. audience, we work to ensure that, if applicable, it is representative of important considerations and differences in information for people of different ages, physical and mental abilities, gender identities, sexual orientations, ethnicities, relationship statuses, and family types.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ethics</h3>
<p>Verywell content is for informational purposes and is not intended to serve as a substitute for the advice of a physician or other healthcare professional.</p>
<p>Our websites are certified by <a href="http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Patients/Visitor/visitor.html">Health on the Net</a> (HON) and we are committed to following HON's <a href="https://www.hon.ch/HONcode/Webmasters/Conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>. Our content is guided by and upholds the <a href="https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp">Society for Professional Journalists’ foundations of ethical journalism</a>: being accurate and fair, minimizing harm, acting independently, and being accountable and transparent. We also uphold the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf"> Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines on disclosures</a>, where applicable.</p>
<p>For more information, please see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="/legal#terms"
>Verywell Terms of Use</a></li>
<li><a
href="/legal#privacy"
>Verywell Privacy Policy</a></li>
<li><a
href="/legal#ads"
>Verywell Advertising Policy</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>The editorial staff manages all of the content you find on our sites. As information in the space we cover is ever-evolving, we report on the body of research on a topic rather than a single study or opinion. We support and justify statements, claims, and suggestions with clear, primary references that are, when applicable, peer-reviewed. Sources are listed at the bottom of every article containing a statement of medical fact. Priority is given to using the most recent, significant sources on a matter.</p>
<p>We favor the reporting of research done on humans, rather than animals. When animal research is relevant and all that is available on a matter, it may be reported, but will be identified as such. Though animal research results can not automatically be applied to humans, findings can further understanding of some subjects.</p>
<p>Verywell reports on proven treatments, but may inform you of experimental or alternative treatments that require more research from time to time. Any treatments with questionable efficacy will be noted as such, and any established safety concerns will be mentioned.</p>
<p>We take care in the way we choose to cover particularly sensitive subjects, especially those that may trigger symptoms in some individuals.</p>
<p>Our expert writers responsibly balance the presentation of verifiable facts with professional perspectives, both their own and those of respected peers. Opinions are clearly stated as such.</p>
<p>Verywell contributors do not give preferential treatment to any outside resource (company, publication, video, affiliate, website) based on their relationship with the person or company who authors or owns that resource—even if that person is himself or herself. In cases when an outside resource is objectively relevant to an article and useful to a reader, appropriate disclosures are made in accordance with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-revises-online-advertising-disclosure-guidelines/130312dotcomdisclosures.pdf">FTC guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you find one of our articles via search, on-site navigation, social media, email, or some other means, you can be sure that “what you see is what you get.” Verywell’s guidelines strictly prohibit titles that do not accurately match the content of the article.</p>
<p>Links are added to content with the sole purpose of navigating you to relevant content throughout our sites that may help further your knowledge about your topic of interest. We may link to outside web pages if they relate to a source used to create our content or we think they provide additional information that may be of assistance. These are chosen carefully and point to U.S. government agencies, reputable associations and organizations, journals, or other trustworthy entities.</p>
<p>Point-of-purchase links are clearly labeled as such (for more about product recommendations, please see below). Verywell content will never link to pages that sell drugs or supplements, or that recruit for participants for clinical trials or other research.</p>
<h3>Quality Standards</h3>
<p>Every article you see has several people behind it working to make sure that it is responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, and reflective of our guiding principles and editorial guidelines.</p>
<p>Content is only published to the site after it has been reviewed and edited by <a
href="/about-us#OurTeam"
>our editorial team</a>. All visuals, tools, and videos are subject to the same approval process.</p>
<p>Our editors approve all article ideas independently. They review and edit all material before it is published and work to regularly improve our corpus to ensure that it remains comprehensive and best in class.</p>
<p><a
href="/about-us#ReviewBoard"
>Our Medical Review Board</a>, composed of board-certified physicians, vets every article with a statement of medical fact, providing any necessary critique that will guarantee that our information is accurate and up-to-date.</p>
<p>The editorial team evaluates existing content as a matter of routine to flag any articles that contain information that is known to be or is likely to be out of date. Among other things, articles are assessed to ensure that a) they reflect current research and advice of health/wellness experts; b) they reflect current guidelines of leading professional organizations and U.S. government agencies, if applicable; c) statistics, if present, are up-to-date; d) they answer any new questions a reader may have as a result of changing times. If necessary, articles are re-edited. Articles with updates to/additions of statements of medical fact are then re-reviewed by our Medical Review Board.</p>
<p>If an article has been modified, it will be designated as such (and dated) at the top of the page. Experienced freelancers trained in our process and policies assist with some updating efforts.</p>
<p>The editorial team collaborates with other Verywell colleagues to ensure that every aspect of our sites is in line with our mission and standards.</p>
<p>Among the other staffers dedicated to ensuring the quality of what you see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Photo editors and illustrators help choose images and create art that reflects our variety of readers and properly represents the topic at hand. (Illustrations are created with the input of our editors and Medical Review Board.)</li>
<li>Our data sciences team continuously looks at search trends in the space to ensure that we have content that meets your needs.</li>
<li>Product managers, designers, and engineers monitor usage of our sites, in accordance with our <a
href="/legal#privacy"
>Privacy Policy</a>, to improve your experience across all devices and develop new features.</li>
</ul>
<p>Verywell staff members who work on content creation do not work on the advertising team. All staffers are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest.</p>
<h3>Writers</h3>
<p>We carefully recruit and work with writers who are experts in their areas, from board-certified doctors to credentialed dietitians to licensed therapists and others. This group includes notable voices in their respective disciplines who have experience working with people looking to live their healthiest, happiest lives—just like you.</p>
<p>Every article’s author is listed at the top of the page with a linked bio, which you can access to learn more about his or her credentials, education, professional experience, and social media presence.</p>
<p>These individuals are specifically selected for both their extensive knowledge and real-world experience, as well as their ability to communicate complex information in a clear, helpful way.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sclerosis, migraines, and other neurology topics are covered by a <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/colleen-doherty-md-1717970">practicing board-certified physician</a> who sees patients with such concerns—and who lives with some of these issues herself.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.verywellfamily.com/amy-morin-2605926">licensed clinical social worker and practicing psychotherapist</a> contributes content on child behavior and parenting challenges. Among her media appearances and speeches, her TEDx talk is one of the top 50 of all time.</li>
<li>Exercise content comes from an American College of Sports Medicine and American Council on Exercise-certified <a href="https://www.verywellfit.com/laura-williams-85817">exercise physiologist and fitness nutrition specialist</a>.</li>
<li>A <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/lauren-muhlheim-psy-d-ceds-1138027">licensed, practicing clinical psychologist</a>, certified eating disorders expert, and author—who has served on the board of the Academy for Eating Disorders (AED)— writes our eating disorders content.</li>
</ul>
<p>All writers are required to uphold the editorial guidelines mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Licensed & Third-Party Content</h3>
<p>Licensed or third-party content is carefully reviewed by the Verywell editorial team to ensure that it is aligned with our policies and standards. Any such content is labeled to notify you of its source.</p>
<h3>Advertising</h3>
<p>Verywell accepts advertising on all of its sites but maintains a strict and clear separation between advertising and editorial content. Please see our <a
href="/legal#ads"
>Advertising Policy</a> for full details on how advertisements and sponsored content are distinguished on our pages and the guidelines to which they must adhere.</p>
<p>Special attention is paid to featuring advertising in a way that will not interfere with your reading experience. This relates to both page design and the number of ads we choose to feature on a page.</p>
<h3>Product Recommendations</h3>
<p>The internet offers endless consumer choice, putting millions of products at your fingertips, and we want to do what we can to streamline the steps you need to take to find what you’re looking for quickly and reliably.</p>
<p>The expert writers and editors of Verywell’s product review team help our users make the best purchase decisions by obsessively scouring the retail landscape (both online and off) to identify and research the best products for your healthy lifestyle and family. We receive an affiliate commission on some, but not all, of the products that we recommend if you decide to click through to the retailer site and make a purchase.</p>
<p><b>Trust:</b> Our independent writers and testers pick products that are the best in their category and they do not know the terms of any of our affiliate partnerships, so you can be sure you are getting authentic and trustworthy recommendations. Furthermore, we buy all of the products that we test with our own money and never accept anything for free from manufacturers. We want to make sure we’re providing you with the most unbiased feedback that we can.</p>
<p><b>Product content:</b> Curated lists of recommendations are written by writers with subject-matter expertise in every product category. Recommended products run the gamut from budget to splurge-worthy, and are not favored because of any loyalty to one specific retailer or brand. We make it a point to recommend products from reliable companies who deliver exemplary customer service, so you can have a seamless shopping experience. The availability of products is checked daily by a team of dedicated editors.</p>
<p>After a list is published, it is regularly revisited and updated, if needed, to ensure that existing recommendations are fresh, accurate, and helpful.</p>
<p>If you have questions, comments, or opinions you’d like to share with our product review team, please email <a href="mailto:commercefeedback@dotdash.com">commercefeedback@dotdash.com</a>.</p>

<div class="expert-content">
<p>At Verywell, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. In this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) we describe our privacy practices with regard to information we collect through Verywell.com and affiliated sites, Verywellhealth.com, Verywellmind.com, Verywellfit.com and Verywellfamily.com (collectively, the “Site”), to help you make informed decisions about how you share information when you visit or use the site.</p>
<h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on Verywell</h3>
<h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
<p>We may collect information, including personal data, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.</p>
<p>You also may choose to provide personal data about yourself when you participate in forums or discussions on the Site. Please be aware that information you post in these forums may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive personal data that you would not want to be available to the public.</p>
<h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit Verywell</h4>
<p>When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site). We or our third-party partners may combine information that each of us collects automatically with other information about you, including information you choose to provide.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b> are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. See the section below regarding <a href="#anchor_yourChoices">Your choices</a> to learn more about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality.</p>
<p>To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you. <b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.</p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors to the Site.</p>
<p><b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b> Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” in this context. Like many other websites, Verywellfamily.com is not configured to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">Click here to learn more about "do not track" signals.</a></p>
<p>Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like” buttons), also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers.</p>
<p>Further information regarding our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is described in our <a href="#cookies">Cookies Disclosure.</a></p>
