<div class="expert-content">
<p>At Verywell, we take online privacy seriously and we respect the concerns of our community of users. In this policy (the “Privacy Policy”) we describe our privacy practices with regard to information we collect through Verywell.com and affiliated sites, Verywellhealth.com, Verywellmind.com, Verywellfit.com and Verywellfamily.com (collectively, the “Site”), to help you make informed decisions about how you share information when you visit or use the site.</p>
<h3>Understanding How Information Is Collected on Verywell</h3>
<h4>Information You May Choose to Provide to Us</h4>
<p>We may collect information, including personal data, directly from you if you choose to provide that information. For example, you may provide us with your name and contact information (such as an email address), date of birth, or other details of that nature, when you sign up for our newsletters or participate in promotions or surveys on the Site.</p>
<p>You also may choose to provide personal data about yourself when you participate in forums or discussions on the Site. Please be aware that information you post in these forums may be viewed or captured by anyone who visits the Site, therefore you should avoid posting sensitive personal data that you would not want to be available to the public.</p>
<h4>Information That Is Automatically Collected When You Visit Verywell</h4>
<p>When you access the Site, we and our third-party partners may automatically collect certain information about your visit using tools such as cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. The information collected automatically when you visit the Site may include your IP address, characteristics of your operating system, information about your browser and system settings, data about the computer or mobile device you use to access the Site, unique device identifiers, clickstream data (which shows the page-by-page path you take as you browse the Site). We or our third-party partners may combine information that each of us collects automatically with other information about you, including information you choose to provide.</p>
<p><b>Cookies</b> are small files that websites and other online services use to store information about users on the users’ own computers. This Site may use cookies (such as HTTP and HTML5 cookies and Flash cookies), as well as other types of local storage. For more information about cookies, you may visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. See the section below regarding <a href="#anchor_yourChoices">Your choices</a> to learn more about how you may limit or disable cookies on your computer. If you choose to disable cookies, that could affect certain features of the Site that use cookies to enhance their functionality.</p>
<p>To manage our automatic data collection, we may place tags (often referred to as “web beacons”) on pages on the Site or in emails we send to you. <b>Web beacons</b> are small files that link web pages to particular web servers and their cookies, and they may be used for a variety of purposes, such as counting the number of visitors to the Site, analyzing how users navigate around the Site, assessing how many emails that we send are actually opened and which articles or links are viewed by visitors.</p>
<p>We also use third-party web analytics services, such as Google Analytics, on the Site, to provide us with statistics and other information about visitors to the Site.</p>
<p><b>“Do Not Track” Signals.</b> Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “do not track” signal to websites and online services you visit. At this time there is no consensus among industry participants as to the meaning of “do not track” in this context. Like many other websites, Verywellfamily.com is not configured to respond to “do not track” signals from browsers. <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/">Click here to learn more about "do not track" signals.</a></p>
<p>Finally, companies that provide certain third-party apps, tools, widgets, and plug-ins that may appear on the Site (for example, Facebook “Like” buttons), also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information collection is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers.</p>
<p>Further information regarding our use of cookies and other tracking technologies is described in our <a href="#cookies">Cookies Disclosure.</a></p>

<h3>Information for Users Outside the United States</h3>
<p>Your personal data may be stored, transferred and process in and to the United States and in other countries by our affiliates and/or service providers.

We will transfer your personal data in compliance with applicable data protection laws and will implement suitable safeguards to ensure that your personal data is adequately secured by any third party that will access your information (for instance, by using the Model Clauses as approved by the European Commission).</p>
<p>By using our Site and providing personal data to us, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the collection, use, maintenance, transfer to and processing of your personal data in the United States or other countries or territories, and, unless otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we use this consent as the legal basis for that data transfer.</p>
