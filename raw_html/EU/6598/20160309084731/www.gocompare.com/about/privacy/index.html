<LI><STRONG>Failure to do so may lead to your insurance policy being invalid or an increase in cost.</STRONG>&nbsp;You may also be liable for any third party costs in the event of an accident.</LI></UL>
<P>a)&nbsp;In order to accept a quotation provided by us you will need to link to the underlying insurance company website and retrieve your details or, where applicable, contact them by phone.</P>
<P>b) Before purchasing a policy it is extremely important that all the information the insurance company holds on you is accurate. You should therefore ensure that all information you provide to us is complete and accurate.&nbsp; Neither we nor any insurance providers will check this information for you.&nbsp; Again, failure to do this may lead to your insurance being invalid or an increase in the cost of that policy. </P>
<P>c)&nbsp;It is important that you read the insurance company's terms and conditions to check that you understand and agree with them. The insurance company's terms and conditions are not the same as ours and they will be the terms you agree to when you accept a quotation.</P>
<P>d)&nbsp;It is important that you read all insurance documents issued to you and ensure that you are aware of the cover, limits and other terms that apply.&nbsp; Failure to comply with the insurer's terms and conditions could invalidate your policy.</P>
<P>e)&nbsp;You should also check that all your details on the policy documents are correct, including any assumptions that may have been made on your behalf by the insurer. If the information supplied by you is not correct, it is your responsibility to notify the insurance company.&nbsp; Failure to inform the insurer of any errors or missing information could invalidate your policy.</P>
<H4>2.&nbsp;Other obligations</H4>
<P>a)&nbsp;You must keep your password confidential and it must not be disclosed to or shared with anyone.&nbsp; You are solely responsible for all use of your account on our website.</P>

<H4>4.&nbsp;Sensitive Personal Data</H4>

Sensitive personal data may take the form of criminal convictions or your medical history.&nbsp; By continuing to use our website you consent that you are happy for us to do this. If you are not happy, you may stop using our website at any time.<BR></div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>How we use your data to obtain a quote</h3><div>In order to provide our services to you we need to collect and process personal&nbsp;data about you and disclose that&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;to a number of third party service providers and insurance partners. This&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;is necessary to provide you with the quotations and services that you have requested. All personal&nbsp;data will be held in strictest confidence and used only for the purposes for providing the service you have requested, subject to certain exceptions as described below.</div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>Renewal quotes</h3><div>Our systems may re-submit your quote details when your renewal is due (based on the cover start date you entered as part of your last quote). That&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;will be sent to our insurance partners to calculate and return their quotes and, as part of this process, some partners may carry out soft credit checks. For more information about this, please see the section entitled <A href="#credit-searches">Credit Searches</A> below.</div></div></P><div> <A id=how-else-we-use-your-data></A><h3>How else do we use your personal data?</h3><div> 
<H4>1. Research</H4>
<P>We, our nominated sub-contractors, or other companies within the esure Group of companies may use your personal data to carry out market&nbsp;research and statistical analysis, on a personalised or aggregated basis. This market research and statistical analysis may assist us (and any esure Group of companies) in improving our website and services offered to you or other individuals in the future.</P>
<H4>2. Prevention of Fraud</H4>
<P>We will carry out analysis and research using your personal data in order to prevent or detect fraud. Where we feel it is appropriate to do so, we may share your personal&nbsp;data with the Insurance Fraud Bureau (IFB) and, if necessary, the police. Those bodies may utilise that data to investigate or combat fraud.</P>
<P>We contribute personal information regarding fraud, fraudulent behaviour and misuse to a number of databases and registers that have been set up to detect or prevent fraud. We will also provide&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;to third parties such as the police, law enforcement or fraud prevention agencies where we believe it is reasonably necessary for the detection or prevention of fraud. We may also provide personal data to other third parties if the terms of a court order require us to do so. All data to be shared for these purposes will take place in accordance with data protection laws in the United Kingdom.</P>
<P>Please also see the section entitled <A href="#device-reputation">Device Reputation</A>.</P>

<H4>4.&nbsp;Transferring your data outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")</H4>
<P>Some processing of your personal data may be undertaken by nominated sub-contractors outside of the EEA.&nbsp;In these circumstances the processing will be undertaken in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998. Your use of our services will be considered to be an indication of your consent to this transfer.</P>
<P>Please note that some of our insurance partners may carry out some of their administrative services from outside of the EEA.&nbsp; Where this is the case it will be set out in their terms and conditions and privacy policy.<BR></div></div></P><div> <h3>What communications will you receive from us?</h3><div>

We, or a carefully selected third party may also use the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;you supply to perform market research, contact you to ask for your feedback or to remind you when your renewal date is due. Your&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;may also be disclosed and used for these purposes after your policy has lapsed. </P>
<P>We utilise a third party software and storage solution to analyse the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;that you have provided to us in order to ensure that the marketing that you receive is as relevant and beneficial to you as possible. We retain full ownership of your&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;and ensure that it is secure at all times.</P>

<P>Calls may be recorded for training, quality and monitoring purposes.<BR></div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>Data enrichment</h3><div>We may:</P>
<UL><LI>share and match your personal data internally within the esure Group of companies; and</LI>
<LI>may validate and analyse your personal data (in some cases, match it against information that has been collected by a third party)</LI></UL>
<P>to ensure that the personal data&nbsp; is as accurate, consistent and well-organised as possible and to help us to improve the products and services that we offer to you.<BR></P>
<P>As well as ensuring that any marketing material that we send you is appropriate to your needs, this process also ensures that our services continue to be as personalised and customer-focused as possible. (We will only use third party data where the third party can show that the data was collected and processed with consent).<BR></div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>How do our insurance partners use your personal data?</h3><div>Our insurance partners will use your personal data to assess and rate your cover prior to issuing a quotation to you via our website or when you purchase a policy from them. Some of our insurance partners may search external sources (e.g. the edited electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy registers) to assess your application for accuracy. For specialist products such as student insurance, our partners may also search higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status. Searches of this kind may be recorded by credit agencies but they won't affect your credit rating. If you purchase a policy please note that these searches may take place again when your policy is due for renewal.</P>
<P>Our partners may use the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;you provide to obtain a quote for purposes such as fraud prevention or for internal analysis (such as monitoring customer demographics, market trends or pricing analysis). Some of our insurance partners may also use personal data they hold about you (or which is held by other members of their group or in some instances the company whose brand is administered by them) from loyalty schemes and other account information. Some insurance providers may pass this personal data to their insurance underwriters. </P>
<P>PLEASE NOTE that some insurance companies exchange&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;through various databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers, which may or may not have given rise to a claim. This exchange of&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;enables insurance companies to verify the&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;that is provided during the quote process (including&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;about any third party who is named on the policy), and also helps to prevent fraudulent claims.</P>
<P>Please also refer to the section on insurance provider <A href="#credit-searches">credit searches</A> below.</div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>Do we pass personal data to third parties</h3><div>Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any of your personal data to other parties without your permission unless we are legally required to do so by, for example, a court order, for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime, or by a regulator. Also see the section on Confidentiality below.</div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>Driving licence number</h3><div>If you provide your driving licence number this may be passed to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out as part of your quote and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or the named driver's) driving licence record. For details relating to&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;held about you by the DVLA, please visit <A title="" href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk" target=_blank>www.dvla.gov.uk</A>.<SUP>†</SUP> Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure.</div></div></P>
<P><div> <h3>Monitoring</h3><div>Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, text messages and other communications may take place in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes such as: for quality control and training; processing necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract; to prevent unauthorised use of our telecommunication systems and websites; to ensure effective systems operation; to meet any legal obligation; in order to prevent or detect crime; and for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the data controller. </P>
<P>Please visit the following websites for further information <A title="ico - Homepage" href="http://www.ico.org.uk/" target=_blank>www.ico.org.uk</A> and <A title="" href="http://www.bis.gov.uk" target=_blank>www.bis.gov.uk</A>.<SUP>†</SUP><BR></div></div></P><A id=credit-searches></A><A id=credit-searches></A>
<P><div> <h3>Credit searches</h3><div><BR>Many insurance providers operate a credit scoring system and will carry out checks with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies, and other public and privately available sources of information. These checks will include electoral roll and credit information. </P>
<P>These insurance credit checks are registered as general insurance searches and may be viewed by other companies when you apply for credit or insurance. These searches should not harm your credit profile or adversely affect your credit profile.</P>
<P>PLEASE REMEMBER that while we do not carry out credit searches on our website, our partners may do so at any stage of the quote, renewal&nbsp;or purchase process. This may happen regardless of whether you get a quote via the internet or phone for any of these services. </P>
<P><STRONG>PLEASE NOTE every application you submit for a loan or credit card may affect your credit scoring</STRONG> so you may wish to restrict the number of applications you make to reduce the effect on your credit rating.<BR></div></div></P><div> <h3>Contact from insurance partners</h3><div> 
<H4>1. Help with choosing</H4>
<P>If during the quote process you tell us that you are you happy to be contacted, you agree that your&nbsp;personal data&nbsp;may be used by the top two competing service providers who provided you with the cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quoted product. </P>
<P>Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected. They are only entitled to contact you regarding the particular quotation and for a limited period of time only. Some insurance partners may also contact you by telephone if you click through to their website to help you with any queries you may have, regardless of their position in the results.</P>
<H4>2.&nbsp;Unsolicited emails and phone calls</H4>
<P>If you click through to a third party website from our website, we cannot guarantee you will not be contacted by those parties. We recommend that you read their terms &amp; conditions regarding your right to opt-in or opt-out of receiving further contact from them.</P>
<P>Most websites will send a confirmation email once a quote has been completed on their website but we have put contractual safeguards in place to prevent our insurance partners from sending you unsolicited emails or making unsolicited phone calls. Please let us know if you experience any problems.<BR></div></div></P><A id=device-reputation></A>
<P><div> <h3>Device reputation</h3><div>To protect both you and us, we use services provided by a third-party to help our insurance providers decide whether to accept transactions from personal computers, mobile phones or other devices that are used to visit our website.&nbsp;We may also use this service to help decide whether to allow these devices to use our services. The third-party service checks whether these devices have been identified with fraudulent or abusive transactions in the past, such as reported instances of identity theft, promotion abuse or credit card fraud.</P>
<P>When you complete a quote through our website, we will transmit data concerning certain technical attributes of your device such as the model, operating system, and browser version, as well as its IP address and city, all of which are used to confirm device identification.&nbsp;If we conclude that a device has or may have been used in connection with fraudulent, suspicious&nbsp;or abusive activity&nbsp;involving us or our insurance providers, we may transmit additional information to the third party (including relevant email addresses, customer identification numbers, associated phone numbers, vehicle registration number, or password clue information) that are connected to a suspect device. If you have questions about our use of this device reputation service, please email us on <A title="Fraud insight" href="mailto:fraudinsight@gocompare.com">fraudinsight@gocompare.com</A>.</P>

<P>ii.&nbsp;If relevant, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (MID), run by the Motor Insurers' Bureau. The MID may be accessed by the Police in order to establish who is insured to drive a vehicle. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad) other UK insurance companies or the Motor Insurers' Bureau may search the database to ascertain relevant policy information. Persons with a valid claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain certain information which is held on the MID.
