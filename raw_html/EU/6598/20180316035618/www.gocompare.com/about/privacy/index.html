<div> <h3>What are your responsibilities?</h3><div>
<h4>1. Insurance obligations</h4><p>We will provide you with quotations based on the information you have provided to us.  Where we ask questions to help source quotations, <strong>you are responsible for</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Answering all questions honestly, completely and to the best of your knowledge, and for ensuring that any assumptions made are correct.</strong></li><li><strong>Failure to do so may lead to your insurance policy being invalid or an increase in cost.</strong> You may also be liable for any third party costs in the event of an accident.</li></ul><p>a) In order to accept a quotation provided by us you will need to link to the underlying insurance company website and retrieve your details or, where applicable, contact them by phone.</p><p>b) Before purchasing a policy it is extremely important that all the information the insurance company holds on you is accurate. You should therefore ensure that all information you provide to us is complete and accurate.  Neither we nor any insurance providers will check this information for you.  Again, failure to do this may lead to your insurance being invalid or an increase in the cost of that policy.</p><p>c) It is important that you read the insurance company's terms and conditions to check that you understand and agree with them. The insurance company's terms and conditions are not the same as ours and they will be the terms you agree to when you accept a quotation.</p><p>d) It is important that you read all insurance documents issued to you and ensure that you are aware of the cover, limits and other terms that apply.  Failure to comply with the insurer's terms and conditions could invalidate your policy.</p><p>e) You should also check that all your details on the policy documents are correct, including any assumptions that may have been made on your behalf by the insurer. If the information supplied by you is not correct, it is your responsibility to notify the insurance company.  Failure to inform the insurer of any errors or missing information could invalidate your policy.</p><h4>2. Other obligations</h4><p>a) You must keep your password confidential and it must not be disclosed to or shared with anyone.  You are solely responsible for all use of your account on our website.</p><p>b) Where you provide information about any other individual (e.g. a named driver) you are confirming to us that you have their authority to do so.</p><p>c) You must not misuse our website by knowingly introducing viruses, trojans, worms, logic bombs or other material which is malicious or technologically harmful. You must not attempt to gain unauthorised access to our website, the server on which our website is stored, or any server, computer or database connected to it.

<br />
</div></div></p><p><div> <h3>How do our insurance partners use your personal data?</h3><div>Our insurance partners will use your personal data to assess and rate your cover prior to issuing a quotation to you via our website or when you purchase a policy from them. Some of our insurance partners may search external sources (e.g. the edited electoral roll, county court judgments, bankruptcy registers) to assess your application for accuracy. For specialist products such as student insurance, our partners may also search higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status. Searches of this kind may be recorded by credit agencies but they won't affect your credit rating. If you purchase a policy please note that these searches may take place again when your policy is due for renewal.</p><p>Our partners may use the personal data you provide to obtain a quote for their own internal purposes such as fraud prevention or for internal analysis (such as monitoring customer demographics, market trends or pricing analysis). Some of our insurance partners may also use personal data they hold about you (or which is held by other members of their group or in some instances the company whose brand is administered by them) from loyalty schemes and other account information. Some insurance providers may pass this personal data to their insurance underwriters.</p><p>PLEASE NOTE that some insurance companies exchange personal data through various databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE) which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers, which may or may not have given rise to a claim. This exchange of personal data enables insurance companies to verify the personal data that is provided during the quote process (including personal data about any third party who is named on the policy), and also helps to prevent fraudulent claims.</p><p>Please also refer to the section on insurance provider <a href="#credit-searches">credit searches</a> below.</div></div></p><p><div> <h3>Do we pass personal data to third parties</h3><div>Except as set out in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any of your personal data to other parties without your permission unless we are legally required to do so by, for example, a court order, for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime, or by a regulator. Also see the section on Confidentiality below.</div></div></p><p><div> <h3>Driving licence number</h3><div>If you provide your driving licence number this may be passed to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Searches may be carried out as part of your quote and at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. A search with the DVLA will not show on your (or the named driver's) driving licence record. For details relating to personal data held about you by the DVLA, please visit <a href="http://www.dvla.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.dvla.gov.uk</a>.<sup>†</sup> Undertaking searches using your driving licence number helps insurers check personal data to prevent fraud and reduce incidences of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure.</div></div></p><p><div> <h3>Monitoring</h3><div>Monitoring or recording of your calls, emails, text messages and other communications may take place in accordance with UK law, and in particular for business purposes such as: for quality control and training; processing necessary for the entering into or the performance of a contract; to prevent unauthorised use of our telecommunication systems and websites; to ensure effective systems operation; to meet any legal obligation; in order to prevent or detect crime; and for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the data controller.</p><p>Please visit the following websites for further information <a title="ico - Homepage" href="http://www.ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">www.ico.org.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.bis.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.bis.gov.uk</a>.<sup>†</sup><br />
</div></div></p><a id="credit-searches" name="credit-searches" /><a id="credit-searches" name="credit-searches" /><p><div> <h3>Credit searches</h3><div>
<br />
Many insurance providers operate a credit scoring system and will carry out checks with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies, and other public and privately available sources of information. These checks will include electoral roll and credit information.</p><p>These insurance credit checks are registered as general insurance searches and may be viewed by other companies when you apply for credit or insurance. These searches should not harm your credit profile or adversely affect your credit profile.</p><p>PLEASE REMEMBER that while we do not carry out credit searches on our website, our partners may do so at any stage of the quote, renewal or purchase process. This may happen regardless of whether you get a quote via the internet or phone for any of these services.</p><p><strong>PLEASE NOTE every application you submit for a loan or credit card may affect your credit scoring</strong> so you may wish to restrict the number of applications you make to reduce the effect on your credit rating.
<br />
</div></div></p>
<div> <h3>Contact from insurance partners</h3><div>
<h4>1. Help with choosing</h4><p>If during the quote process you tell us that you are you happy to be contacted, you agree that your personal data may be used by the top two competing service providers who provided you with the cheapest quotes to contact you with a view to seeing if you are interested in purchasing the quoted product.</p><p>Please note that the companies contacting you are solely based on the cheapest price retrieved not exclusively based on the cover you selected. They are only entitled to contact you regarding the particular quotation and for a limited period of time only. Some insurance partners may also contact you by telephone if you click through to their website to help you with any queries you may have, regardless of their position in the results.</p><h4>2. Unsolicited emails and phone calls</h4><p>If you click through to a third party website from our website, we cannot guarantee you will not be contacted by those parties. We recommend that you read their terms &amp; conditions regarding your right to opt-in or opt-out of receiving further contact from them.</p><p>Most websites will send a confirmation email once a quote has been completed on their website but we have put contractual safeguards in place to prevent our insurance partners from sending you unsolicited emails or making unsolicited phone calls. Please let us know if you experience any problems.
<br />
</div></div></p><a id="device-reputation" name="device-reputation" /><p><div> <h3>Device reputation</h3><div>To protect both you and us, we use services provided by a third-party to help our insurance providers decide whether to accept transactions from personal computers, mobile phones or other devices that are used to visit our website. We may also use this service to help decide whether to allow these devices to use our services. The third-party service checks whether these devices have been identified with fraudulent or abusive transactions in the past, such as reported instances of identity theft, promotion abuse or credit card fraud.</p><p>When you complete a quote through our website, we will transmit data concerning certain technical attributes of your device such as the model, operating system, and browser version, as well as its IP address and city, all of which are used to confirm device identification. If we conclude that a device has or may have been used in connection with fraudulent, suspicious or abusive activity involving us or our insurance providers, we may transmit additional information to the third party (including relevant email addresses, customer identification numbers, associated phone numbers, vehicle registration number, or password clue information) that are connected to a suspect device.

The MID may be accessed by the Police in order to establish who is insured to drive a vehicle. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad) other UK insurance companies or the Motor Insurers' Bureau may search the database to ascertain relevant policy information. Persons with a valid claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain certain information which is held on the MID.
