<p>We are a group of IT professionals enthusiastic in creating quality free tools and content on the internet. The main purpose of this website is to provide a comprehensive collection of free online calculators for the ease of public use. This site was launched in calculators.info first in 2007. In 2008, we purchased and migrated to calculator.net.</p>
<p>More than 99% of the calculators on this site were developed in-house. Some calculators use open-source JavaScript components under different open-source licenses. More than 80% of the calculators are based on well-known formulas or equations from textbook, such as the mortgage calculator, BMI calculator, etc. If formulas are controversial, we give out the results of all popular formulas, such as the ideal weight calculator. The calculators for amusement only are based on internal formulas, such as the love calculator. The results of the financial calculators were reviewed and approved by our financial advisors, who work for major personal financial advising firms. The results of the weight loss calculators and the pregnancy calculators were reviewed and approved by local medical doctors. More than 95% of the descriptive content was developed in-house with a small amount of content taken from wikipedia.org under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_the_GNU_Free_Documentation_License" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GNU Free Documentation License</a>. The descriptive content of the financial calculators were either created or reviewed by our financial advisors. The descriptive content of the weight loss calculators and the pregnancy calculators were either created or reviewed by local medical doctors. The rest of the descriptive content was created by our own engineers. Beside this site, we also have <a href="/projects/">free apps for mobile visitors</a>.</p>
