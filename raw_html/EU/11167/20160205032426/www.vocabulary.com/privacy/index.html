	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>This
privacy policy explains how Thinkmap, Inc. (&quot;Thinkmap&quot;,
&quot;We&quot;, or &quot;Us&quot;) collects and uses personal information that
you (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) provide on Vocabulary.com and on the
Vocabulary.com App (collectively &quot;Vocabulary.com&quot;). This privacy
policy was last updated on 2/6/2014.</p>

<h2>Collecting of Personal Information</h2>

<p>In
order to take advantage of certain features of Vocabulary.com, you must
register. When you register for Vocabulary.com, we require that you provide
your name, email address, and your date of birth. We also may collect
information about the school you attend as well as other information that might
appear on your user profile.</p>

<h3>User Profiles</h3>

<p>Users
have a public profile page that is linked from their name when it appears on Vocabulary.com.
These pages present information that you provide such as a nickname or favorite
word. The profile page may show information about your use of Vocabulary.com such
as achievements earned, lists created, or your level.</p>

<h3>User Content</h3>

<p>Users
of Vocabulary.com can create various types of content (&quot;User
Content&quot;) that may be displayed publicly on Vocabulary.com. User Content
includes information such as vocabulary lists, comments, and other types of
material that is shared with the community.</p>

<h3>Children</h3>

<p>Children
under 13 are provided a limited feature set. All children who sign up must
provide a parent's email address. The parent is then notified that the child has
signed up to use Vocabulary.com. We ask that children chose a username that is
not their real name. Children are restricted from certain parts of Vocabulary.com.
For example, children do not have public profiles, and they cannot comment on
articles or word lists. In addition, we do not collect children's email
addresses, so all email communication from Vocabulary.com will be sent to the
parent's email address.</p>

<p>If
you are a parent, and you agree to let your child use Vocabulary.com, you agree
and acknowledge that you permit your child to use Vocabulary.com and all
features made available on Vocabulary.com as fully contemplated by us. As a
parent, you understand that any personally identifiable information that your
child provides in connection with registration or otherwise may be used by us
as provided in this Privacy Policy. Except where the context indicates
otherwise, the remainder of this Privacy Policy (including any discussion of
the personally identifiable information that we may collect, use or disclose) shall
apply equally to a child account and an account for someone over 13.</p>

<h3>User-Generated Content and Public Activities</h3>

<p>We
offer opportunities for you to engage in public activities on Vocabulary.com,
including submitting comments and creating word lists. Any information you
disclose in your public activities, along with your nickname or username and
any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by us. Your public
activities may also be read and collected by other users of the public activity
areas on Vocabulary.com. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable
information you choose to submit in these forums.</p>

<h3>Orders</h3>

<p>If
you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally
identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact
information (such as name and email) and financial information (such as billing
address, credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for
billing purposes. &nbsp;If we have trouble processing an order, we may use this
information to contact you.</p>

<h2>Communication from Vocabulary.com</h2>

<h3>Customer Service</h3>

<p>Based
upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a
welcoming email to verify your email address and password. &nbsp;We will also
communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you
request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email
only.</p>

<h3>Service-related Announcements</h3>

<p>We
will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is
necessary to do so. &nbsp;For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended
for maintenance, we might send you an email.</p>

<p>Generally,
you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in
nature.</p>

<h3>Question Emails</h3>

<p>If
you have registered for Vocabulary.com, we may send you a periodic email that
includes&nbsp;a personalized vocabulary question, and information about new
content on Vocabulary.com. You may opt out of these emails. (Please see
&quot;Choice and Opt-out&quot;)</p>

<h3>Other Emails</h3>

<p>You
may opt in to receive other emails, such as comment notifications or emails
when new material comes out on the blog. You may opt out of these emails.
(Please see &quot;Choice and Opt-out&quot;)</p>

<h3>Special Offers and Updates</h3>

<p>We
will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals,
and promotions. You may opt out of these emails. &nbsp;(Please see &quot;Choice
and Opt-out&quot;)</p>

<h2>How We Handle&nbsp;Personally Identifiable
Information</h2>

<p>We
may disclose personally identifiable information to provide products or
services you've requested when we have your permission, and we may access,
preserve and disclose account information and User Content if required to do so
by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is
reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with legal process; (ii) enforce our <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/terms/">Terms
of Use</a>; (iii) respond to
claims that any User Content violates the rights of third parties; (iv) provide
support relating to Vocabulary.com; or (v) protect the rights, property or
personal safety of the company, its users and the public.</p>

<p>We
also may disclose personally identifiable information to an educator if you
join a class owned by that educator. In this case, we may provide your name and
your performance on particular activities on Vocabulary.com, so that the
educator can better help you with your vocabulary learning.</p>

<p>If
you are an educator and you add a student who is under 13 to your class, you
acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for compliance with the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, including, but not limited to, obtaining
parental consent concerning collection of students' personal information used
in connection with the provisioning and use of Vocabulary.com.</p>

<p>In
addition, we transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged
with another company. In this event, we will notify you of any such change in
ownership or control of your information.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>To
improve Vocabulary.com, we track usage by aggregating information on what pages
consumers access or visit.</p>

<h3>Cookies</h3>

<p>Cookies
are required to use Vocabulary.com. A cookie is a small amount of data, which
often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser
from a website's server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use
cookies to record current session information, and to track the effectiveness
of Vocabulary.com changes, marketing, and advertisements. We, and
third-party vendors, including Google, may use first-party cookies and
third-party cookies together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on
someone’s past visits to Vocabulary.com.</p>

<h2>Third Parties</h2>

<p>We
contract with other companies to provide services on our behalf, including
credit-card and billing processing, e-mail distribution, and analytics.
Analytics may include 3<sup>rd</sup> party audience data (such as age, gender,
and interests) on both our website and any mobile applications.</p>

<h3>Usage of collected information from tracking</h3>

<p>We
use collected information for the following general purposes: products and
services provision, identification and authentication, services improvement,
and research. We may use aggregated information (such as age, gender, and
interests) to more effectively market Vocabulary.com to advertisers. We may use
remarketing to advertise online. In this case, third-party vendors, including
Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet.</p>

<h3>Registration via Third-Party Tools</h3>

<p>You
can sign up for an account on Vocabulary.com by using third-party login credentials,
such as your Facebook account information. This single sign-on service allows
you to associate your existing third-party profile with an account on Vocabulary.com.
As part of this process, we may access certain information contained in your
third-party profile, such as your name, your profile picture, and your email
address.</p>

<p>When
you share or like (with or without adding your own comments) any Vocabulary.com
articles or content to your Facebook profile, that action is governed by the
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/">Facebook Privacy Policy</a>.
We do not track or store a record of those comments or actions.</p>

<h2>Choice and Opt Out</h2>

<p>We
provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable
information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.
&nbsp;For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive
any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on
our order form.</p>

<p>If
you no longer wish to receive certain communications from us, you may opt-out
of receiving them by either changing the email preferences section of the <a href="https://www.vocabulary.com/account/">My
Account</a> section, or
through clicking on the provided link on any communication that we send.</p>
