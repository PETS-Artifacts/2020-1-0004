Frequently asked questions
</h1>
<hr>
<h4>
1. I have a car for sale and want to advertise it on your site. How do I do that?
</h4>
<p>
OOYYO is price comparison engine for used cars which displays cars for
sale from other websites through classified ads. Therefore, it is not
possible for an individual to advertise directly on OOYYO.
However, if you want your car to be shown on our site, you can advertise it
on websites whose content is being displayed on OOYYO and your
ad will then appear in our listings.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
2. I own a website with classified car ads and want to include them on
your site.
</h4>
<p>
You can add your cars by sending us an XML feed with the listing of the cars
from your website. All the information you need for setting up an XML feed
can be found here:
<a href="javascript:void(0)" class="submission-link">submission</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
3. I found a car I’m interested in, but I don’t know how to contact the seller.
</h4>
<p>
On the page with the detailed description of your chosen car, you’ll find
the link <em><strong>Contact seller</strong></em>. By clicking on that link,
you will be redirected to the ad on the originating website.
On that page you can find the seller’s contact information.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
4. I want to buy a car found on your website.
</h4>
<p>
All information about the conditions for purchase can be found on the
originating website, by clicking on the link
<em><strong>Contact seller</strong></em> on the page with the detailed
description of your chosen car. OOYYO does not own the cars in
the listings and therefore takes no part in the sale.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
5. I want to buy a car found on your website and import it to another country.
Where can I find information about exporting?
</h4>
<p>
OOYYO is not responsible for the sale, purchase, export or import
of cars from its listings. For more information on purchase and export
conditions, please contact the seller whose information can be found by
clicking on the <em><strong>Contact seller</strong></em> link on the page
with the detailed description of the chosen car.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
6. I found a car I want to buy, but the ad has been removed from/has
expired on the originating website.
</h4>
<p>
Despite the fact that data on OOYYO is updated on a daily basis,
the selection of cars changes from hour to hour. The car you found has been
sold (or removed for some other reason) subsequent to OOYYO
collecting the information on the car in question.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
7. Why is the price of a car in some cases different on OOYYO from
the price on the originating website?
</h4>
<p>
The car dealer or owner has changed the price after OOYYO collected
the information from that website.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
8. I want to buy a car abroad but I don’t speak the language of that country.
</h4>
<p>
OOYYO allows you to search for cars in 34 countries in the language
of your choice from a range of 31 languages. First, choose the desired language
from the drop-down menu in the upper right corner and then the search country
by selecting the desired country in the search box on the homepage or the results page.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
9. I have a suggestion, idea or proposal for cooperation.
</h4>
<p>
If you haven’t found the answer to your question here, or you have a proposal
for cooperation with OOYYO, please contact us by filling out the
form on the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="contact-link">Contact us</a> page.

<h2>BENEFITS OF AN XML FEED! Why an XML feed?</h2>
<h3>Improve the visibility of your ads on OOYYO</h3>
<hr>
<p>We would like to explain the way in which we generate data from your site, and the <strong>benefits</strong> of XML feeds.</p>
<p>Our crawling program indexes your site page by page, beginning with the home page, or using your sitemap.xml if you have one, respecting the rules in your robots.txt file in doing so.</p>
<p>A more accurate and practical way of doing this is by using XML feeds. By sending us data on all your vehicles via XML feeds means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>100% fresh data</strong> with no expired links</li>
<li><strong>100% accurate data without</strong> malformed URLs and similar problems that are possible when a site is indexed manually.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Since OOYYO's algorithm <strong>favours the freshest results with the cleanest data</strong>, if you use XML feeds, vehicles from your site will appear <strong>more often than other results</strong>.</p>
<p>XML feed access and explanations are available below:<br>
