<p id="personal-information"><strong>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND WHEN, AND WHY WE USE IT ABOUT YOU</strong>
</p>
<p>ACTIVE is a leading provider of Activity and Participant Management™ solutions. Our flagship technology platform, ACTIVEWorks®, transforms the way organizers manage their activities and events by automating online registrations and streamlining other critical management functions, while also driving consumer participation to their events. Our Sites include online communities for people who want to discover, participate in, and share activities about which they are passionate. </p>
<p>The information we collect from you allows you to log into our Sites, use our Services and Applications, and register for and/or set up registration for you or your organization’s own customers for events, contests, camps, licenses, classes, tickets, facility/equipment use, transactions, sales, memberships, reservations, donations, and/or activities (collectively, <strong>“Events”</strong>). </p>
<p>We also collect information from businesses, organizations, and individuals who request information from ACTIVE.</p>
<p>Individuals (and agents of individuals) may provide us information directly or indirectly by registering for an Event or by otherwise using our Services (these individuals are referred to as <strong>“Consumers”</strong>). For example, you may enter your information in order to register for an Event, or someone who has organized a team may enter your information on your behalf to register your entire team. </p>
<strong><s>
</s></strong>
<p>In addition, individuals or organizations (i.e. our Clients) can use our Services to set up Events for Consumers. Relatedly, our Clients (including agents of our Clients) may provide us personal information about individuals who have registered for an Event being operated by our Client or who the Client wants us to contact or otherwise provide Services to on behalf of the Client.</p>
<p>We collect or receive personal information from you via our Sites, Applications and/or Services.  For example, we receive personal information from you directly when you create an online account or register for an Event. We also collect personal information about you, for example, by using cookies to understand how you use our Sites.</p>
<p>We collect personal information from third parties whom you have authorised to provide your personal information to us (for example, this may be via one of our Clients, who provides your personal information to us). We combine this information with the information we collect directly from you or about you for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy.  More details on how we share your information with others is below in the <strong><a href="https://www.activenetwork.com/information/privacy-policy#how-weshare"> HOW WE SHARE PERSONAL INFORMATION WITHIN ACTIVE AND WITH OUR SERVICE PROVIDERS, REGULATORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES </a></strong>section. We also collect personal information from individuals who may refer you as a friend to our loyalty programs or products or services.  We ask these individuals to confirm that you are happy to hear from us.</p>
<p>We will only collect, use, and share your personal information where we are satisfied that we have an appropriate legal basis to do this.

<p id="how-we-protect"><strong>HOW WE PROTECT AND STORE PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We have implemented and maintain appropriate technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures designed to reduce the risk of accidental destruction, or loss, or unauthorised disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the information concerned, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>	(where appropriate) password protection, encryption, and use of secure communication transmission software (known as "secure socket layering" or "SSL") to protect our Sites; </li>
    <li>	placing confidentiality requirements on our employees and service providers;</li>
    <li>	destroying or permanently anonymising personal information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected; and</li>
    <li>	following strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your personal information to prevent unauthorised access to it.
    Whilst we take appropriate technical and organisational measures to safeguard your personal information, no transmission over the Internet can ever be guaranteed to be secure.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information that you transfer over the Internet to us and any such transmission is at your own risk.  </li>
    <p>As the security of personal information depends in part on the security of the computer you use to communicate with us and the security you use to protect usernames and passwords, you should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, computer, and web-enabled devices, among other things, by signing off after using a shared computer, inserting a password on your web-enabled device, choosing a password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, keeping your password private, and periodically changing your password. You should never share your log-in information with others. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen or compromised passwords, or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity. </p>
    <p><strong>Storing your personal information </strong></p>
    <p>We will store your personal information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Policy. Where your information is no longer needed, we will ensure that it is disposed of in a secure manner. In some circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting requirements.  </p>
    <p>In specific circumstances we may store your personal information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your personal information or dealings.</p>
    <p id="marketing"><strong>EXPLAINING MORE ABOUT DIRECT MARKETING</strong>
    </p>
    <p><strong>How we use personal information you keep you up to date with our Services</strong></p>
    <p>We may use personal information to let you know about our Services that we believe will be of interest to you. We may contact you by email, post, or telephone or through other communications channels that we think you may find helpful.  In all cases, we will respect your preferences for how you would like us to manage marketing activities with you. </p>
    <p>We also work with carefully selected third parties, such as promotional partners and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.  At all times, in accordance with your marketing preferences, these third parties may contact you by email, SMS/text, social media or through other communications channels to tell you about products and services that they believe would be of interest to you. </p>
    <p><strong>How you can manage your marketing preferences</strong></p>
    <p>To protect privacy rights and to ensure you have control over how we manage marketing with you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>	We will take steps to limit direct marketing to a reasonable and proportionate level and only send you communications which we believe may be of interest or relevance to you;</li>
        <li>	At any time you can update or correct your personal profile, or change your preferences for the way in which you would like us to communication with you, including how you receive details of latest offers from us;</li>
        <li>	If you have an online account with us, the easiest way to make updates to your marketing preferences and/or change your personal details is to log onto your account.  You can also click the “unsubscribe” link that you find on any online newsletters you receive or contact customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@activenetwork.com"> support@activenetwork.com. </a></li>
        <li>	You can ask us to stop direct marketing at any time – you can ask us to stop sending email marketing by following the unsubscribe link you will find on all the email marketing messages we send you. Alternative you can contact us at  <a href="mailto:support@activenetwork.com">support@activenetwork.com.</a> Please specify whether you would like us to stop all forms of marketing or just a particular type (e.g. email); </li>
        <li>	You can change the way your browser manages cookies, which may be used to deliver online advertising, by following the settings on your browser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We recommend you routinely review the privacy notices and preference settings that are available to you on any social media platforms as well as your preferences in your account with us. Further, if (in accordance with your marketing preferences) you receive marketing from the third parties referred to above, we recommend you review any relevant third party's privacy notice for how they use your personal information.</p>
    <p> Be aware that if you unsubscribe from our marketing communications we may be unable to notify you of tailored services or offer to meet your needs.
