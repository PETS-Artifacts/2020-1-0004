    <h2>9.	Do Not Track Policy</h2>
    <p class="terms">Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that you can set in your browser. DNT is a way
        for you to inform websites and services that you do not want certain information about
        your webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. The Company
        is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information it collects and
        that is why the Company provides you the ability to opt out. But the Company does not
        recognize or respond to any DNT signals as the Internet industry works toward defining
        exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to
        responding to DNT. For more information, visit <a href="//www.allaboutdnt.com">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.
