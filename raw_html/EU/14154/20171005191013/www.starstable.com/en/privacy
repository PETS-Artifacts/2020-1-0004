                    We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases
                    when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact,

                    information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you
                    can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as
                    little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization,
                    bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to Star Stable
                    Entertainment AB's successor or assign.

                    We may also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by
                    recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness
                    of our marketing campaigns. For this reason, these types of clear gifs are tied to personally
                    identifiable information.

                <h4 id="ip">What are Internet protocol addresses?</h4>

                <p>
                   An Internet protocol ("IP") address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service
                    Provider ("ISP"). Star Stable Entertainment AB may track such IP addresses for system administration,
                    to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from
                    being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.

                <h4 id="secure">How secure is my personal information?</h4>

                <p>
                    The security of your personal information is important to us. Star Stable Entertainment has taken
                    steps to assure that all information collected will remain secure and in its original form, i.e.
                    free from any alteration. As such, access to all personal information is strictly controlled. When
                    credit card information is transmitted, for example, we use industry standard, SSL
                    (secure sockets layer) encryption. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal
                    information submitted to us, both during transmission and once it is received.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, we will take reasonable steps to assure that third parties to whom we transfer any
                    data will provide sufficient protection of personal information.
                </p>
