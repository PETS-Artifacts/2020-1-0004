<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="English.2C_not_Legalese"> English, not Legalese </span></h3>
<p>Most Terms of Service and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.
</p><p>Because we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.
</p><p>Please don’t forget that we are real people: take a look at our about page to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we’re trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.
</p><p>When you read Orr Group or &quot;we&quot; below, it refers to The Orr Group, LLC, its affiliates, and agents.
</p><p>Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please send us an e-mail at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mailto:team@roll20.net">team@roll20.net</a>.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Using_Roll20_means_accepting_these_terms"> Using Roll20 means accepting these terms </span></h3>
<p>By accessing or using Roll20 in any way, whether you have created your own Roll20 account or are invited to view someone’s private content on Roll20 (such as joining a game as a player), or are just browsing around, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.
</p><p>If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not access Roll20.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="This_is_a_living_document"> This is a living document </span></h3>
<p>This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.
</p><p>If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We’re all ears! Email <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="mailto:team@roll20.net">team@roll20.net</a> and we’ll chat.
</p><p>We don’t amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we’ll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll to the bottom to see the history so far.
</p><p>We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the site, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.
</p><p>Your access and use of Roll20 is always subject to the most current version of this document.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Breach_of_Terms"> Breach of Terms </span></h3>
<p>If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use Roll20 automatically terminates. Any materials downloaded or printed from Roll20 in violation of the Terms of Service must be immediately destroyed.
</p><p>We may block, restrict, disable, suspend or terminate your access to all or part of Roll20 at any time in our sole discretion, without prior notice or liability to you.
</p><p>If you think we removed your access by mistake, let us know and we’ll give you our reasoning. We also have a quick way to restore access without losing any of your data.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Support"> Support </span></h2>
<p>Support for Roll20 is provided via our <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://community.roll20.net">Community Forums</a>. We also provide a <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://help.roll20.net">Help and Documentation Site</a> with guides and screencasts that provide instruction on performing common tasks.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Access_to_your_data"> Access to your data </span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_personal_data_do_you_collect_and_why.3F"> What personal data do you collect and why? </span></h3>
<p>We collect the following personal data:
</p>
<ul><li> Name (including Display Name)
</li><li> E-mail address
</li><li> IP Address (for general statistics on usage and abuse prevention)
</li></ul>
<p>We do not collect Credit Card information directly. See <i>Who can see my credit card number?</i> below.
</p><p>We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.
</p><p>Please be aware that your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from roll20.net in order for you to use Roll20.
</p><p>Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_can_see_my_password.3F"> Who can see my password? </span></h3>
<p>No-one. We never store your password unencrypted, so no-one can read it.
</p><p>It is your sole responsibility to keep your email, password and other sensitive information confidential. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security, you shall notify Orr Group immediately.
</p><p>If you forget your password, we send you a secure link via email that lets you reset it.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_can_see_my_credit_card_number.3F"> Who can see my credit card number? </span></h3>
<p>No-one at Orr Group. We use the very trustworthy and secure <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> payment service. Read about their security measures on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://stripe.com/terms">Stripe Terms of Service</a> (in short, they encrypt your credit card info using industry-standard practices).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Our_Commitment_to_Children.E2.80.99s_Privacy"> Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy </span></h3>
<p>Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_can_I_access_or_correct_my_information.3F"> How can I access or correct my information? </span></h3>
<p>You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by logging in to Roll20 and visiting the My Account page.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_can_access_my_campaigns_and_other_content.3F"> Who can access my campaigns and other content? </span></h3>
<p>By default, all campaigns and other assets that you create or upload to Roll20 are private. However, if you invite players to join your game, or choose to share your campaigns with other Roll20 users, then they will have access to view those specific campaigns and any assets used in those campaigns. Any assets that you upload to the Roll20 Marketplace will also be made public under the license that you select when the asset is submitted.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_the_guidelines_Orr_Group_follows_when_accessing_my_data.3F"> What are the guidelines Orr Group follows when accessing my data? </span></h3>
<ul><li> We restrict who at Orr Group can access customer data to only senior members of the team, and never to outside contractors.
</li><li> We only do it in response to a customer support question, or to look at issues affecting the entire Roll20 application.
</li><li> We only do it in order to debug and fix the issue.
</li><li> We never make changes to anything unless explicitly requested by a user.
</li><li> We never ever ever share what we see with other customers or the general public.
</li><li> We might give access to US authorities if requested in writing. We’ll try not to, but we don’t have the resources to fight the government. We’ll also keep the account owner informed as much as we can if this happens.
</li></ul>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_is_my_data_protected_from_another_customer.E2.80.99s_data.3F"> How is my data protected from another customer’s data? </span></h3>
<p>All of our customers’ data resides in the same database. We use software best practices to guarantee that only people who you designate as viewers of your data can access it. In other words, we segment our customer data via software. We do our best and are very confident we’re doing a good job at it, but, like every other web app that hosts their customers data on the same database, cannot guarantee that a sophisticated hacker cannot access other people’s data.

Any failure by Orr Group to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Service or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
