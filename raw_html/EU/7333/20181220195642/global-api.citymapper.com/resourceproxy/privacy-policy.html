                This policy applies to anyone who uses our website, <a href="https://citymapper.com">www.citymapper.com</a> ("Site"), our app ("Citymapper App"), our transportation services ("CM Smart Ride"), and our driver app ("Driver App").  We'll refer to the Site, Citymapper App, and Driver App together as "the App".

            <p>
                There are three categories of information we collect: (1) information you provide, (2) information created when you use our App or CM Smart Ride; and (3) information from other sources.

Assuming you've enabled your device to provide location information and you haven't entered your start point manually, we collect and use your start location information as determined through data such as GPS, mobile phone towers, and WiFi. If you haven't enabled your device to provide location information, you will have to manually enter your start and end points, which is then the location information we collect and use.

We use this data to provide on-trip support, such as alerting you when to get off a bus.   We also store and analyse this data in aggregate, as we do with the other types of location data described in this "Location Information" section, to improve the journey results we show to all users and to create and evaluate routes for our transportation services.

We store and use this information to comply with legal record-keeping requirements, for operational reasons, such as providing customer support, and to improve our service.

                        <u>Search Partners:</u> We have search partners like Yelp, Google, Apple, and Foursquare in order for the App to send you to the places you want to go. They receive the text you have searched for, and in order to return results most relevant to you, they receive your current location if you have enabled location permission in your device.

They receive the pick-up and destination locations you enter in order to provide travel time and fare estimates, and they receive that information for your convenience if you choose to book a ride through their apps by clicking through the Citymapper App.

For example, if you use the "Share Directions" feature in the App, a link with your start and end points will be sent via messaging app.  If the messaging app company you choose uses end-to-end encryption, your location link cannot be used or intercepted by that messaging app company.
