The laws in the United States may not be considered adequate by authorities in your home country. If you prefer not to have your Personal Information transferred to the United States or elsewhere, don’t use this Site. Otherwise, by using this Site, you expressly consent and authorize Trading Technologies to transfer your Personal Information to destinations outside your home country as we see necessary to run our business, and process it according to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you can’t or choose not to provide us with the Personal Information we reasonably require, we may be unable to provide you with the information or services you have requested.</p>
<h4>Information We Collect Through Automatic Data Collection Technologies.</h4>
<p>As you navigate through and interact with the Sites, we may use automatic data collection technologies to collect certain information about your equipment, browsing actions, and patterns. Some of this information may be linked to you personally. This information helps our Sites function correctly and supports the work we do to understand the needs of our customers. Examples of this information include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Details of your use of the Sites, including website related traffic data, location data, logs, age, gender, market segment, interests, and other communication data and the resources that you access and use on the Sites.</li>

<li>Information about your device, computer and network connection, including your IP address, operating system, hardware version, device settings, battery and signal strength, and browser type.</li>
<li>Device locations, including specific geographic locations, such as through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.</li>
<li>Connection information such as the name of your mobile operator or ISP, language and time zone, and mobile phone number.</li>
</ul>
<p>The technologies we use for this automatic data collection may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cookies (or browser cookies).</strong> A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. If you continue without changing your settings, we will assume that you are happy to receive all cookies on the Site. You can change your cookie settings at any time. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Sites.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Advertising, Use of Cookies, and Other Tracking Technologies</h3>
<p>We advertise in a number of ways, including online through managed social media presences, and on other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications. To understand how our advertising campaigns are performing, we may collect certain information via our Sites through our advertising service providers. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information, such as browser cookies, web beacons, and other similar technologies. The information we collect includes IP addresses, the number of page visits, pages viewed via our Sites, search engine referrals, browsing activities over time and across other websites following your visit to one of our Sites or applications, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the websites and applications where we advertise.</p>
<p>We also use certain information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify new visitors to our Sites;</li>
<li>Recognize returning visitors;</li>
<li>Advertise on other websites and mobile applications not affiliated with us;</li>
<li>Analyze the effectiveness of our advertisements;</li>
<li>Better understand our audience, customers, or other Site visitors; and</li>
<li>Determine whether you might be interested in new products or services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Controlling Our Tracking Tools.</h4>
<p>Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so, however, depends on your browser and the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject all browser cookies. If you configure your computer to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain web page features, and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Sites. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. Some browsers have a “Do Not Track” feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals.</p>
<h4>Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads.</h4>
<p>We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on other companies’ websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties. For example, your postal code may be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or on third party websites.</p>
<p>For more information about our ad service provider and its cookies, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, you may visit www.aboutads.info/choices. In addition, users may prevent Google’s collection of data generated by your use of the Sites (including your IP address) by downloading and installing a Browser Plugin available at tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en.</p>

<h3>Disclosure of Your Information</h3>
<p>We do not share your Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties for their own direct marketing activities. Whatever the purpose may be – whether we share with service providers or other external entities – we only process and share your Personal Information to the extent necessary to fulfill your requests and our legitimate business objectives. We may also disclose your Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To our subsidiaries and affiliates, which are located in multiple countries around the world.</li>

<li>With brokers, futures commissions merchants, or other clearing firms with whom you grant permission to share information.</li>
<li>To fulfill the purpose for which you provide it. For example, if you give us an e-mail address to use the “share via e-mail” feature of our Sites, we will transmit the contents of that e-mail and your e-mail address to the recipients; and information related to trades entered by you will be shared with the relevant exchanges.</li>
<li>To a buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding, in which Personal Information held by us is among the assets transferred.</li>
<li>For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also disclose your Personal Information:</p>
<ul>
<li>To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.</li>
<li>To enforce or apply our agreements with you, including for billing and collection purposes.</li>
<li>If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, property, or safety, our customers or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
<li>Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding the Personal Information you provide to us. If you signed up to receive newsletters or other marketing communications from us, you can opt-out any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of your email message. Even after you opt-out or update your marketing preferences, please allow us sufficient time to process your marketing preferences. It may take up to 10 days to process your e-mail related requests, and up to 30 days for all other marketing-related requests. And even after you’ve opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us, we may still contact you for transactional or informational purposes. These include, for example, customer service issues, returns or product-related inquiries, surveys or recalls, or any questions regarding a specific order.</p>
<h3>Data Security</h3>
<p>The security and confidentiality of your Personal Information matters to us. We have implemented reasonable measures designed to secure your Personal Information from loss or unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure. We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods. Even so, despite our reasonable efforts, no security measure is ever perfect or impenetrable.</p>
