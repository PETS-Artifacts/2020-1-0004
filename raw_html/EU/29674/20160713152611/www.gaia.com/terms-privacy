<h4>COMMUNITY POSTING GUIDELINES:</h4>
<p>At Gaia, we believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to transform their lives. In the spirit of community, we strive to maintain tolerance, equality and respect. The Internet has opened up a world of opportunity that humanity has never seen before. However, the Internet also gives people the means to insult or harass others without taking full responsibility for their words. We insist that while youíre on Gaia, you respect the people you encounter, as well as their opinions. Youíre free to disagree, state your own opinion and provide critical feedback, but please keep it respectful. Please respect other membersí beliefs, and consider your impact on others when making your contribution. If you canít conduct yourself in a respectful manner, we reserve the right to remove comments. In extreme cases, we reserve the right to disable the ability to comment.</p> 
<p>We understand that many of our topics are controversial, and we fully support debate. However, we won't allow misrepresentation of our brand, show hosts, show guests or any Gaia-affiliated talent to be published on our site. We reserve the right to determine what is a constructive argument and whatís a smear tactic.</p> 
<p id="anti-spam">Our comment sections are dedicated to discussion about the content. If youíre experiencing a technical issue with a video, please contact customer service directly at <a href="mailto:Info@gaia.com">info@gaia.com</a>. Technical problems posted in the comment section will be deleted once the problem is addressed. If a hyperlink to an external site is posted, we reserve the right to remove the hyperlink, or remove the comment entirely. </p>

<h4>ANTI-SPAM POLICY</h4>
<p>At Gaia we are 100% against spam and unsolicited emails and maintain CANSPAM compliance.  We do not sell or provide email addresses to any unauthorized third party and do not authorize any third party or affiliate to misuse products or services created by or associated with Gaia in spam or bulk emails.  If you feel you have received any unwanted emails from us, please contact us immediately and we will look into the matter.</p>
<p>Gaia prohibits the use of their website and/or services in any manner associated with the transmission, distribution or delivery of any unsolicited bulk or unsolicited commercial e-mail (ìSpamî). You may not use any Gaia services to send Spam. You also may not deliver Spam or cause Spam to be delivered to any customers of Gaia.</p>
<p>In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 (15 U.S.C. 7701, et seq., Public Law No. 108-187, was S.877 of the 108th United States Congress), e-mail sent, or caused to be sent, to or through the Gaia website or service or on behalf of Gaia may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>use or contain false, misleading, invalid or forged headers </li> 
<li>use deceptive or misleading subject lines</li> 
<li>use or contain invalid or non-existent domain names;</li>
<li>employ any technique to otherwise misrepresent, hide or obscure any information in identifying the point of origin or the transmission path;</li>
<li>use other means of deceptive addressing;</li>
<li>use a third partyís internet domain name, or be relayed from or through a third partyís equipment, without permission of the third party;</li>
<li>contain false or misleading information in the subject line or otherwise contain false or misleading content;</li>
<li>fail to comply with additional technical standards described below;</li>
<li>otherwise violate our Terms of Use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gaia does not authorize the harvesting, mining or collection of e-mail addresses or other information from or through the website or its services. Gaia does not permit or authorize others to use the Gaia services to collect, compile or obtain any information about its customers or subscribers, including but not limited to subscriber e-mail addresses. Gaia does not permit or authorize any attempt to use its services in a manner that could damage, disable, overburden or impair any aspect of any of the services, or that could interfere with any other partyís use and enjoyment of any Gaia service.</p>
<p>If Gaia believes that unauthorized or improper use is being made of any service, it may, without notice, take such action as it, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate, including blocking messages from a particular internet domain, mail server or IP address. Gaia may immediately terminate any account on any service which it determines, in its sole discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any e-mail that violates this policy.</p>
<p>Nothing in this policy is intended to grant any right to transmit or send e-mail to, or through, the Gaia website and/or services. Failure to enforce this policy in every instance does not amount to a waiver of Gaiaís rights.</p>
<p>Unauthorized use of any Gaia  services in connection with the transmission of unsolicited e-mail, including the transmission of e-mail in violation of this policy, may result in civil, criminal, or administrative penalties against the sender and those assisting the sender.</p>
<p>Violators of the CAN SPAM Act may be subject to ìcease and desistî orders or penalties from the FTC (Federal Trade Commission) of up to $11,000 per violation. Criminal prosecution is also possible in the case of egregious offenders, which can result in penalties such as fines, forfeiture of proceeds and equipment. The worst offenders can also be subject to prison time.</p>
