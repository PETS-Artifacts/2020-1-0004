							The following advice on data protection applies when you visit our website https://www.native-instruments.com, including the use of the associated online shop. <br />
<br />
We are aware that you take the protection of your personal data very seriously, and the protection of your personal data is equally important to Native Instruments. For this reason, we strictly comply with statutory provisions when collecting, processing and using your data. We apply technical and organisational measures to ensure the protection of the personal data we receive from you. This includes training our employees in their obligation to comply with data privacy guidelines (customer services are exclusively implemented by Native Instruments Group employees), as well as procedural and digital security measures related to the processing of your data.<br />
<br />
In the following section we will provide information about the methods, purpose and scope of the data processing which takes place when you visit our website and/or our online shop. <br />
<br />
We continuously strive to help you with any questions you may have regarding data processing issues relevant to our online services. If you have any questions, please contact the department responsible for data processing:<br />
<br />
Native Instruments GmbH<br />
Data protection officer: Kai-Hendrik Weutzing<br />
Schlesische Str. 29-30<br />
10997 Berlin, Germany<br />
Email: privacy@native-instruments.de <br />
<br />
<h2>1. Personal Data</h2>The following information relates to the processing of your personal data. Personal data refers to all data which refers to you personally, i.e., name, address, email address, payment information or your activities as a user.<br />
<br />
<h2>2. Data Capture Every Time You Access the Website</h2><strong>a) Usage Data</strong><br />
<br />
Every time you access the website, even if it is only to look for information and you do not log in or register a customer account, or otherwise deliberately transfer information (for example by signing up for a newsletter), we will capture the following data, transmitted by your browser, which allow you to visit the website (usage data): <br />
<br />
<ul><li>IP address</li><li>Date and time of the request</li><li>Duration of the visit to the website</li><li>Time zone difference to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) </li><li>Contents of request (actual page) </li><li>Access status/HTTP-status code </li><li>Respectively transmitted data quantities </li><li>Which website the request is coming from </li><li>Browser, browser language, browser software version</li><li>Operating system </li></ul><br />
<br />
For IT security reasons, we will save your IP address in our IT system log files for 7 days following your website visit in order to recognize and prevent (Distributed) Denial of Service attacks. After the 7 days have passed your IP address will be anonymized by removing the last 8 bits.<br />
<br />
If your IP address is saved in unabbreviated format, we will only aggregate it with any of the usage data mentioned above if we have a legitimate interest.<br />
<br />
<strong>b) Cookies</strong><br />
<br />
When using our website as well as our online shop, cookies are saved on the device you use to access the page. They enable the Native Instruments systems to recognize your browser and to provide services which are of interest to you personally.<br />
<br />
Cookies are small text files (alphanumeric identification symbols) which are stored on users’ end devices when they visit a website. When the same website is visited again, the information which was saved will then be sent back to the participating server. We use first-party cookies and third-party cookies, which can be designed as session cookies or temporary cookies. <br />
<br />
Session cookies are automatically deleted from your hard drive after your browser session. These cookies store a so-called session ID, which is assigned various requests from your browser during a shared session. This type of cookie is used in relation to the basket function in the online shop as well as to user and licence data. Its use is technically required in order to be able to connect your user account with your actions over separate visits.<br />
<br />
Temporary cookies are deleted after a pre-determined amount of time. These cookies allow us to recognize a repeated website visit based on the feedback from the cookies to the participating server over various browser sessions, in order to – for example – maintain the selected language settings over various website visits. A connection to your user account (where applicable) and the possible identification will only be implemented if you select the “Remember me” function during login. In this way, we can provide a personalized shopping experience. <br />
<br />
Third-party cookies are only set by servers if they are not identical with our servers, i.e. if they come from other websites you have visited. In contrast, first-party cookies on browsers are not accessible across domains. Third-party cookies are used when using our website and our online shop by some third-party companies (for further details about some selected providers used by us, see below under c). <br />
<br />
By using these third-party cookies, also known as “tracking cookies”, a user’s visits to various websites can be assigned to the specific visitor. This allows us to draw conclusions about the visitor’s interests and to accordingly customize websites (personalization, for example through individually tailored advertisements). <br />
<br />
You also have the option of configuring your browser so that specific types of cookies are not allowed or deleted. You can also visit our website if your browser settings block the placing of cookies or if you do not agree with having cookies placed on your hard drive. We would like to inform you, however, that if you do so, you may not be able to fully use all features on our website, in particular purchases via the use of a virtual basket, which will not be possible for technical reasons (see above).<br />
<br />
<strong>c) Third-Party Providers</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>(aa) Google Analytics</strong><br />
<br />
As a part of our internet presence we use Google Analytics, which is a web analysis tool provided by Google Inc. Google Analytics uses cookies to analyze how our website is used. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website, including the abbreviated IP address, is transferred to and stored on a Google server, in some cases located in the USA. The evaluation by Google is exclusively carried out in an anonymous process in which the code expansion provided by Google “anonymizeIp” deletes the last 8 bits of your IP address, therefore anonymizing it for subsequent data processing.<br />
<br />
If you have registered a user account with us, we will additionally use a so-called "User ID" for this service. This is a unique, permanent and personalized symbol sequence which we assign to you when you first log in to your user account. When you visit the website and are logged in to your user account, the website activities are assigned to your permanent user ID. This ID is not assigned to a specific end device (smartphone, laptop, etc.), but to you personally. In conjunction with Google Universal Analytics, this User ID is transmitted to Google, where it is used by us at Google as a pseudonym for you as a user. The data accumulated by Google are therefore anonymized for Google, as the service does not have the option to create a link to your user account and therefore to your personal data.<br />
<br />
Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for us as website operators, and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.

<strong>d) Retargeting</strong><br />
<br />
Retargeting is a variant of online targeting in which users of an online service are marked by suppliers via the retargeting function. This function serves to present visitors to a website with interest-based advertisements as part of the advertising networks. In order to do this, your browser stores cookies which make it possible to recognize you as a visitor when you access websites which belong to the corresponding supplier’s advertising network. These pages display advertisements for products based on your previous internet activity, including products in which you have shown an interest on other websites which use the corresponding provider’s remarketing function.<br />
<br />
On our website we mainly use retargeting services from the following suppliers:<br />
<br />
<strong>(aa) Criteo</strong><br />
<br />
If you don’t wish to use the Criteo retargeting function, then you can generally deactivate it by <a title="visiting their website" class=" external-link" href="http://www.criteo.com/privacy/" target="_self">visiting their website</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>(bb) Facebook</strong><br />
<br />
If you don’t wish to use Facebook’s retargeting function, then you can generally deactivate it <a title="via your Facebook account" class=" external-link" href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/?entry_product=ad_settings_screen" target="_self">via your Facebook account</a><br />
<br />
<strong>(cc) Google Remarketing</strong><br />
<br />
According to the company’s own information, Google does not capture any personal data during this process. If you don’t wish to use Google’s retargeting function, then you can generally deactivate it by selecting the  <a title="according settings" class=" external-link" href="https://adssettings.google.com/" target="_self">according settings</a> on Google.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can follow these instructions to  <a title="deactivate the use of cookies for interest-based advertising" class=" external-link" href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!" target="_self">deactivate the use of cookies for interest-based advertising</a>.<br />

If you wish to receive regular information and news about our services, products and campaigns, you have the option of subscribing to our newsletter on our website by entering your email. <br />

<br />
If you have purchased a Native Instrument product or downloaded a so-called “demo” or “free” version of our software, you will also receive a newsletter.

At irregular intervals we will invite you to take part in competitions on our website or via newsletter.

<br />
<h2>5. Additional Data Processing when Setting Up a User Account</h2>In order to be able to see your order data for current and previous orders, as well as the order status of your purchase at any time, you have the option to register a user account on our website.<br />
The obligatory data we require are your name, email address and your personal password. All other data are voluntary and marked accordingly. <br />
<br />
If you would like to use your user account for product purchases, we require your address and payment information for processing contracts. Obligatory data are marked accordingly. All other data are voluntary.<br />
<br />
The personal data submitted relating to this – those which are necessary to fulfil the contract, as well as those which are voluntary – are saved with the option to change or correct them. You can change these data in your customer account in the customer area at any time. <br />
<br />
In order to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data by third parties, in particular your financial data, we secure it according to current technology standards.<br />
<br />
<h2>6. Product Orders, Product Registration</h2><strong>a) Product Orders</strong><br />

<br />
The captured and saved data required for this purpose and as part of contract processing are: Name, address, email address, payment information. All other data are accordingly marked as voluntary information. <br />
<br />
We will store your order data as part of the order history and send you the order data via email.

In case of contract conclusion, we will therefore send you advertising for similar products via email from time to time. If you do not wish to receive these advertising emails then you can retract the use of your email address in the newsletter subscription settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>b) Product Registration</strong><br />
<br />

When registering the product via the website, the serial number of the respective hardware is stored and assigned to your customer account. <br />
<br />
<h2>7. Credit Check and Credit Card Check</h2>For each order which takes place on account or via a credit card, we can check your credit via a credit agency.<br />
<br />
<h2>8. Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>Native instruments is legally obliged to pass on information to third parties. In particular if there is suspicion of a criminal offence, Native Instruments is obliged to pass the data to law enforcement authorities upon request. This includes the exchange of data with companies which handle credit card fraud. In this regard, there is no sharing of your personal data if the company wishes to use these for commercial use.<br />
<br />
Apart from this, we will only use the personal data you entrust us with for processing your products or subscribing to our newsletter. <br />
<br />
For processing newsletter subscriptions, we will pass the email address on to the relevant service provider. This service provider is bound to our instructions as part of an order processing relationship and will not pass your data on to third parties.<br />
<br />
In order to process your product orders, we will pass your address data on to a commissioned delivery company and, where applicable, your payment data to banks that we work with. These service providers are also tied to our instructions as part of an order processing relationship and will not pass your data on to third parties.<br />
<br />
There is no other transmission of your data to third parties.<br />
