What is \"mastering,\" and why is it important?"},"faqPagePart1Desc":{"en":"Mastering is the bridge between music creation and release, whereby a piece of audio is refined, cleaned up, and prepared for commercial standards. Mastering implements processes like equalization, compression, volume normalization and other techniques to make a track ready for consumption by outside listeners."},"faqPagePart2Title":{"en":"2. How does eMastered work?"},"faqPagePart2Desc":{"en":"It's simple. We use cutting edge technology and audio recognition algorithms to analyze and represent your track's sonic identity. Using our complex process eMastered's algorithm then masters the audio to meet commercial music industry standards, all done over the internet within minutes."},"faqPagePart3Title":{"en":"3. How can I prepare my song to get the most out of eMastered?"},"faqPagePart3Desc":{"en":"The most important thing to keep in mind is to avoid clipping. Make sure your master channel is never hitting 0 dB, and ideally aim to have the master channel hitting between -3 and -6 dB. Try and export the audio at the highest possible format both in terms of bit depth and sample rate (a good number to aim for is 48 kHz sample rate and 32 bit depth) which will provide eMastered with the highest quality audio from which to work with. Additionally do your best to remove unnecessary frequencies from the individual tracks in a session before bouncing your unmastered file, as removing these frequencies will provide a cleaner product for eMastered to work with and will provide better results."},"faqPagePart4Title":{"en":"4.
