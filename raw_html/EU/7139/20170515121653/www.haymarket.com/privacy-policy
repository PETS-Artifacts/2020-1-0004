These third parties may include providers of prizes in order to update you of your status of your prize or other fulfilment needs or a co-sponsor who may use your Information to administer the Promotion or for their marketing purposes, but only in conformance with your consent, or with the terms published at the time your personal data is collected. We are not responsible for the privacy policy or practices of third parties.</p>

<p>When you participate in a Promotion, you are subject to any official rules for that Promotion, which may contain additional Information about the specific privacy practices associated with the Promotion.</p>

<p><strong>6.4 Message Boards and Chats</strong></p>

<p>We may make message boards, chat rooms, and other interactive forums available as part of our services. You should be aware that any Information which you post to these interactive forums or otherwise choose to make publicly available, may be disclosed and available to all users who have access to that portion of our website or services.

<p><strong>7 UPDATING AND CONTROL OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>There are a number of ways in which you can control the collection, use, and sharing of your Information and update your Information and preferences.</p>

However, if you are registered on any of the preference services, which are general opt-out registers, you may still receive marketing communications from us if you have given us your consent previously or if you subsequently give us that consent.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>7.3 Contacting Us</strong></p>

<p>If your Information has changed or if you no longer wish to receive marketing communications from us then you can amend your Information or update your preferences if you&nbsp;<u><a href="http://pages.haymarket.com/optout">click here</a></u>.</p>

<p>Please note that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Even if you delete Information, we may retain your Information in conformance with our data retention policy most specifically for legal and tax reasons and to honour your opt-out requests; and</li>
	<li>We do not keep Information longer than we deem necessary.</li>
	<li>We are not responsible for updating or removing your Information contained in the lists or databases of third parties who have previously been provided with Information as permitted by this Policy.</li>

<p style="margin-left:35.45pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>8 THIRD PARTY LINKS AND SERVICES</strong></p>

<p>Please remember that when you use a link to go from our website to another website or you request a service from a third party, our Policy no longer applies. Your browsing and interaction on any other website or your dealings with any other third party service provider, is subject to that website&rsquo;s or third party service provider&rsquo;s own rules and policies. We do not monitor, control, or endorse the Information collection or privacy practices of any third parties. We encourage you to become familiar with the privacy practices of every website you visit or third party service provider that you deal with and to contact them if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies and practices. This Policy applies solely to Information collected by us through our website or services and does not apply to these third party websites and third party service providers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9 WHERE WE STORE YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>The Information that we collect from you may be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination outside the European Economic Area, (all EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Your Information may also be processed by staffs operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers, for instance, for customer service purposes. By submitting Information to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all reasonable steps necessary, including the use of the Model Contractual Arrangements as approved by the EU, or other contractual means to ensure that your Information is treated securely and in accordance with this Policy and the Act.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10 SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>We follow appropriate security procedures in the storage and disclosure of your Information so as to prevent unauthorised access by third parties. We also require those parties to whom we transfer personal Information to comply with the same. However, unfortunately, the transmission of Information via the Internet is not completely secure. So, we cannot ensure the security of your Information transmitted by you to us via the internet. Any such transmission is at your own risk and you acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any unauthorised use, distribution, damage or destruction of your Information, except to the extent we are required to accept such responsibility by the Act. Once we have received your Information we will use security procedures and features to prevent unauthorised access to it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>11 REPORTING OF SECURITY VULNERABILITIES</strong></p>

<p>Haymarket Media Group Ltd is committed to the privacy, safety and security of our customers.&nbsp; If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we would appreciate it if you could report it just to us in a responsible manner.&nbsp; Please email us at <a href="mailto:data.protection@haymarket.com">data.protection@haymarket.com</a> and we will respond to you as soon as possible.&nbsp; This provides us with an opportunity to work with you and quickly address and resolve any issue. Publicly disclosing a potential vulnerability could put the wider community at risk, and therefore we encourage you to come to us first. We&rsquo;ll keep you informed as we move forward with our investigations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>12 SOCIAL MEDIA</strong></p>

<p><strong>12.1 Haymarket Media Group&nbsp;</strong>provides users with the ability to use their social media credentials to sign in to our website(s)&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you create your&nbsp;<strong>Haymarket</strong>&nbsp;account, and authenticate via a third-party service like Twitter or Facebook, you grant permission to the social network to share your user details with us.</p>

<p>Depending on the network this will include</p>

<ul>
	<li>Basic account Information included in your public profile such as name and email address required to verify and facilitate your sign in</li>
	<li>Other Information that is publically available based upon the privacy settings you have with your social media account.</li>
	<li>Any other details you choose to share according to your specific account settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will be clear when we do request more than just basic account Information from you and request that you should also check what permissions we are asking for before you connect with these apps and services. We want to use this Information to better tailor any content we provide to you.</p>

<p><strong>Social sign-in may be provided by&nbsp;Haymarket or a third party</strong></p>

<p><strong>12.2</strong> Social networking sites, such as Facebook, Linked-In, among others, work with us as trusted third party partners. We also work with application developers who specialise in social media, so that we can connect with your social networks. We provide access to our Websites for third parties and business partners so that we can generate interest in our products and services among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product and service interests with friends in your network.</p>

<p><strong>12.3</strong> We do not control how your personal Information is collected, stored or used by such third party sites or to whom it is disclosed. You should review the privacy policies and settings on any social networking site that you subscribe to so that you understand the Information they may be sharing. If you do not want your networking sites to share Information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt-out of sharing such Information. Haymarket is not responsible for how these third party sites may use Information collected from or about you.</p>
