<p>We may freely share and disclose aggregated and other non-personal information (including anonymized information and other non-personal information that is automatically collected as you navigate through and use the Site) without restriction as permitted by law. In particular, we may share Collected Information with certain of our third party service providers (e.g., our web hosting provider whose server logs collect the non-personal information described above) in order to provide the Site to you. We may also share Collected Information with some of our business and marketing partners in furthering our mission as an organization or delivering the content, materials, and services available on or through the Site to you. We and our third party service providers may also produce reports on Site traffic, usage patterns, and similar data generated from non-personal Collected Information, and we may share these reports with our business and marketing partners and others.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify you and we may use and disclose any information about or relating to you, including any personal information about you, to third parties without your consent if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with a court order, search warrant, subpoena, or other legal process; (2) to comply with legal, regulatory or administrative requirements of any governmental authorities; (3) otherwise fulfill a government or law enforcement request for information; (4) establish, defend or exercise our legal rights; (5) protect or defend the Site, users, or our subsidiaries and affiliates, and all of their respective officers, directors, employees, attorneys, agents, contractors, licensors, and partners, in connection with any actual or alleged legal action, claim or dispute; (6) respond to claims that any posting or other content of our Site violates the rights of third parties, including without limitation providing information necessary to satisfy the notice and counter-notice procedures pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act; (7) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of our Site's users or the general public; or (8) enforce compliance with our Terms of Service or other contractual obligations.</p>
<p>If all or part of our company is sold, merged, or otherwise transferred to another entity, we may transfer Collected Information to such entity as part of that transaction.</p>
<p>Every authorization which you grant to us in this Privacy Policy, you also grant to any third party that we may contract for the purpose of operating, maintaining, repairing, or otherwise improving or preserving the Site or its underlying files or systems. You agree not to hold us liable for the actions of any of these third parties, even if we would normally be held vicariously liable for their actions, and that you must take legal action against them directly should they commit any tort or other actionable wrong against you.</p>

<h2>7. Cookies and Beacons</h2>
<div class="bq_fl">
<p>Cookies aren't just delicious; they also apparently have something to do with computers. Cookies help to improve your user experience and allow us to analyze our Site and to analyze and manage our advertising. These Cookies are placed on your computer when your web browser accesses the Site. While some cookies are deleted when you close your browser (session cookies), others remain even after you close your browsing session (persistent cookies).</p>
<p>We use cookies to save your preferences and to recognize you when you return to the Site. We also use analytics cookies to provide data about how users interact with our Site content and advertising campaigns, such as Site traffic. In addition, we use advertising cookies to manage, track, target and serve ads through our third-party service providers. You may not be able to access the full functionality of the Site if cookies are disabled on your browser.</p>
<p>Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your web browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. The "Help" feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. For more information on how to manage browser cookies, see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>We also use web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of visitors from one BrainyQuote.com page to another. A web beacon is an object that is embedded in a web page and is usually invisible to you but allows us to confirm that you have viewed the web page.</p>
<p>We, our service providers and other third parties may analyze the information derived from cookies, pixel tags, web beacons, scripts and other technologies and match or combine that information with data provided by you or collected or received from public and commercial sources. Please note that to the extent that third parties are using pixel tags, cookies, beacons, scripts or other tracking technologies on our Site, we do not control the use of those technologies or the resulting information, the use of which are governed by the privacy policies of those third parties.</p>
<p>If you're new to the Internet, please don't try dunking your mouse in milk and eating it; this is the Number One complaint we get after users read our Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>8. Online Tracking / "Do Not Track" Signals</h2>
<div class="bq_fl">
<p>Some web browsers may give you the ability to enable a "Do Not Track" setting that sends a special signal to the websites you encounter while web browsing that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. Our systems do not recognize browser "Do Not Track" signals. If we do so in the future, we will update this Privacy Policy to describe how we respond to such signals. We may work with third parties that use tracking technologies on the Site, including in order to serve tailored advertisements on our behalf and on behalf of other advertisers across the Internet. These and other third parties may collect information about your activity on the Site over time, as well as your interaction with our advertising and other communications, and use this information to determine which ads you see on third-party websites and apps based on your apparent interests. This is known as interest-based advertising. For more information about this practice and to understand your options, please visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a> or <a href="http://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutads.info</a>.

<h2>10. Third Party Websites</h2>
<div class="bq_fl">
<p>We may link to third party websites from our own Site. We have no control over, and are not responsible for, these third party websites or their use of your personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those websites or ads and we are not responsible for the content found on or the actions or privacy practices employed by any other website or app.</p>
<p>The Site may also offer you the ability to interact with social plugins from social media sites, such as Facebook (facebook.com), Google+ (plus.google.com), Twitter (twitter.com), and Pinterest (pinterest.com). The social media sites may receive data when you visit a website that has plugins. In some cases, we may know that you clicked on a social plugin such as a Facebook Like button, or receive other information from the social media sites. Similarly, if you have previously provided personally identifiable information to a third-party operating a plug-in on this website, then this third-party may recognize you on the Site. Your use of social media plugins is subject to each social media site's privacy policy, which may be different from ours.</p>
<p>We recommend that, if you have a ridiculous amount of free time (and nothing better to do), you review their privacy policies and other agreements governing your use of their website. Once you do, you should report back to us in a detailed and meticulously proofread memorandum explaining all of these websites, so we may immediately put it to use under that corner of the table that is lower than the rest.</p>
</div>

<div class="bq_s">
<h2>11. Law Enforcement</h2>
<div class="bq_fl">
<p>We may disclose your information to a third party where we believe, in good faith that it is desirable to do so for the purposes of a civil action, criminal investigation, or other legal matter. We may also use and disclose information about you to establish or exercise our legal rights, to assert and defend against legal claims, or if we believe such disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding actual or suspected illegal or fraudulent activities or potential threats to the physical safety or well-being of any person.</p>
<p>In the event that we receive a subpoena affecting your privacy, we may elect to notify you to give you an opportunity to file a motion to quash the subpoena, or we may attempt to quash it ourselves, but we are not obligated to do either. Chances are that if the police are looking into your activities on a quote website, you've really got issues.</p>
