        <ol>
            <li> This document explains what data is collected in connection with CD PROJEKT RED games and services.</li>
            <li> It also explains how we use that data, where we store it, and how we protect it.</li>
            <li> In short:
                <ul>
                    <li>in order for you to play our games or use our services we need to process some of your data. Should we need to process your data for any other purpose than offering you our games and services, we will always ask you for your consent in advance.</li>
                    <li>Some partners, such as e.g. GOG, help us in developing our games and services (e.g. forums) and we may share limited data with them – but only for our own purposes.</li>
                    <li>We will not share your data for third party advertising purposes</li>
                </ul>

        </ol>

        <p>Hello! This Privacy Policy is where we explain how your personal data is collected, stored or used, and what happens to it when you're using CD PROJEKT RED games and services. Like with our
            <a href="https://regulations.cdprojektred.com/en/user_agreement/">User Agreement</a>, we have put together two versions: a full text version which is legally binding and also section summaries, which will hopefully make the legal language sound a bit more accesible. You will need to agree to this Privacy Policy before you use a CD PROJEKT RED game or service for the first time. If you have any questions you can contact us at
            <a href="mailto:privacy@cdprojektred.com">privacy@cdprojektred.com</a>.
            <br/>
            Here we go !
