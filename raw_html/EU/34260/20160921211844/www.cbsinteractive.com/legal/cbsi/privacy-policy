        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>With your consent.</strong> With your consent, we may share your contact information with third party marketing partners. For example, CBS Interactive Services such as ZDNet.com and TechRepublic.com offer free access to relevant services (e.g., webcasts and white papers) if you allow your information to be shared with third parties so that they can contact you by email, telephone, postal mail or other common communication methods about their products or services.</li>

All terms applicable to the particular promotion will be made available to you at the time you enter the promotion.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-Branded Partners.</strong> Co-Branded Partners are third parties with whom a CBS Interactive Service may jointly offer a service or feature.
