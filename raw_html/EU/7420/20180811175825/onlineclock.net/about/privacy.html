<li><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>This privacy notice provides you with details of how we collect and process your personal data through your use of our site <strong>OnlineClock.net</strong>.</p>
<p>By providing us with your data, you warrant to us that you are over 13 years of age.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Thomas M. Churm</strong> is the data controller and is responsible for your personal data (referred to as &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo; in this privacy notice).</p>

<p>Email address: <strong>info [at] onlineclock.net</strong></p>
<p>Postal address: <strong>Hagelberger Strasse 45, 10965 Berlin, Germany</strong></p>
<p>If you are not happy with any aspect of how we collect and use your data, you have the right to complain to the Information Commissioner&rsquo;s Office (ICO), the UK supervisory authority for data protection issues (<a href="//www.ico.org.uk/" target="_blank"><em>www.ico.org.uk</em></a>). We should be grateful if you would contact us first if you do have a complaint so that we can try to resolve it for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is very important that the information we hold about you is accurate and up to date. Please let us know if at any time your personal information changes by emailing us at <strong>info [at] onlineclock.net</strong></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>WHAT DATA DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Personal data means any information capable of identifying an individual. It does not include anonymised data.</p>
<p>We may process certain types of personal data about you as follows:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li><strong>Usage Data </strong>may include information about how you use our website, products and services.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also process Aggregated Data from your personal data but this data does not reveal your identity and as such in itself is not personal data. An example of this is where we review your Usage Data to work out the percentage of website users using a specific feature of our site. If we link the Aggregated Data with your personal data so that you can be identified from it, then it is treated as personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Sensitive Data</strong></p>
<p>We do not collect any Sensitive Data about you. Sensitive data refers to data that includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health and genetic and biometric data.

<strong>Please note: starting May 25th, 2018, we will display only non-personalized ads to users in the EEA.</strong>

</ol>

<p><strong>Change of purpose</strong> </p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to find out more about how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please email us at <strong>info [at] onlineclock.net</strong>.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for a purpose unrelated to the purpose for which we collected the data, we will notify you and we will explain the legal ground of processing.</p>
<p>We may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>DISCLOSURES OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We may have to share your personal data with the parties set out below for the purposes set out in the table in paragraph 4 above:</p>
<ul>
<li>Service providers who provide IT and system administration services</li>
<li>Security services who protect our website against malicious activity</li>
<li>Third parties to whom we sell, transfer, or merge parts of our business or our assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to whom we transfer your data to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Countries outside of the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) do not always offer the same levels of protection to your personal data, so European law has prohibited transfers of personal data outside of the EEA unless the transfer meets certain criteria.</p>
<p>Many of our third parties service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.</p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we do our best to ensure a similar degree of security of data by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission; or</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts or codes of conduct or certification mechanisms approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe; or</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the United States, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the <strong>EU-US Privacy Shield</strong> which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</li>
</ul>
<p>If none of the above safeguards is available, we may request your explicit consent to the specific transfer. You will have the right to withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
<p>Please email us at <strong>info [at] onlineclock.net </strong>if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>DATA SECURITY</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know such data. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>DATA RETENTION</strong></li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. These include the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request access to your personal data.</li>
<li>Request correction of your personal data.</li>
<li>Request erasure of your personal data.</li>
<li>Object to processing of your personal data.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>

<h3>More about our Cookies</h3>
<h4>Website Function Cookies</h4>
<h5>Our own cookies</h5>
<p>We use cookies to make our website work including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailoring content to your needs</li>
<li>Remembering your preferences such as dates, alarm sounds, countdowns, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than to not use our site.</p>
<h4>Third party functions</h4>
<p>Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is an embedded YouTube video. Our site uses 3rd party functions from the following companies which use cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> powers the videos on our site</li>
<li>Google - <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> provides the ads and other functions on our site</li>
<li>DART / DoubleClick - <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> provides the ads on our site</li>
<li>Cloudflare - <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Privacy Policy</a> provides security and performance-enhancing functions for our website</li>
</ul>
<p>Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties</p>
<h4> Visitor Statistics Cookies</h4>
<p>We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn't working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called "analytics" programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend. </p>
<p>We use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Analytics - <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> helps us monitor our website's performance</li>
</ul>

<p>We use:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google AdSense - <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> </li>
