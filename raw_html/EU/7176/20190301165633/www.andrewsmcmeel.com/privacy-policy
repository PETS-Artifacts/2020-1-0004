We share your Personal Information with our affiliates, suppliers, vendors, and/or their agents and employees as we deem necessary for the provision of goods and services to you. Specifically, we may share your Personal Information or other data (i) with third parties assisting us in the provision, administration, and management of goods and services generally; (ii) with third parties that assist us in providing goods and services that you request; (iii) with third parties that support our business operations or provide marketing or advertising services on our behalf, including marketing, technical, accounting, legal or other professionals; and (iv) as otherwise required or permitted by law or approved by you. We may use your Personal Information for our general business operations and goods and services provided by us if it is in a form that is not capable of being personally identified with you (including hashed email addresses  as described below or other persistent identifiers) or if it is combined with Personal Information from one or more other customers in aggregate form that does not personally identify any particular customer.  We may also sell, license or otherwise provide such de-identified or aggregated data to third parties.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">We will not share your Personal Information with third parties for their own use unless you have “opted-in” to such sharing. If you have previously opted-in to such sharing under a prior privacy policy version, you are still considered to have opted-in under this Privacy Policy. Regardless of whether you opt-in, Andrews McMeel Universal may use your Personal Information for its own purposes as described herein.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets, and, depending upon the transaction, your Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.

<p><strong>6. What are my options to control the use of my Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">You have the ability to request the deletion of your Andrews McMeel Universal registration at any time by utilizing the registration system established for this purpose. However, we may maintain certain information, including Personal Information, following such deletion, as part of our internal processes to prevent accidental loss of user data or information and to prevent or discourage fraudulent activities that may involve Andrews McMeel Universal registration or account information. We may also continue to maintain information about your registration or account and your computer access to our Sites or services as part of our server logs</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Unless you opt-out or unsubscribe, we may e-mail you with information about other products and services of Andrews McMeel Universal, including information about selected third parties.

Accordingly, you agree that all communications, disclosures, and notices sent to you by e-mail satisfy any requirement that notice be provided in writing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">You may opt-out of allowing us to have any access to your location data by disabling your device’s location detection functionality or GPS or, if possible on your device, disabling permission for our Sites to access such location detection functionality or GPS.</p>
<p><strong>7. How do I update my Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">You can help Andrews McMeel Universal maintain the accuracy of your profile by notifying us when you change your address, phone number, e-mail address, or other information. If at any time you wish to update your Personal Information then contact us or edit the information within your account, if applicable. Please include your old and new contact information in any message so that we can make the appropriate corrections.</p>
<p><strong>8. Children’s Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">The Sites are general audience sites and are not directed to children under the age of 13. Andrews McMeel Universal assumes products and services purchased by credit card are purchased by adults. Andrews McMeel Universal respects the privacy of parents and children and is committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On those areas of the Sites that ask for age, Andrews McMeel Universal does not collect Personal Information from individuals who identify themselves as under the age of 13 except in those limited circumstances where Andrews McMeel Universal believes that such collection is permitted under COPPA.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Andrews McMeel Universal may ask prospective users to provide their age during the registration process and on other areas of the Sites. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 13, then all personal data collected during the registration process is automatically deleted except Andrews McMeel Universal may retain and use limited information, such as the child’s e-mail address, for a limited period of time, in those cases where Andrews McMeel Universal believes that the collection and use of such information is permitted under COPPA.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">If a parent believes that his or her child has submitted personal information to Andrews McMeel Universal, he or she can contact us via e-mail or postal mail as listed below. Andrews McMeel Universal will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 13.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Andrews McMeel Universal believes that parents should supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can help prevent children from otherwise disclosing online their name, address and other personal information without parental permission.</p>
<p><strong>9. Andrews McMeel Universal’s Data Security.</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">We use a variety of commercially reasonable security technologies to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  However, the use of such security technologies is not, and should not be considered to be, any type of guarantee or warranty by us that your Personal Information will not be accessed by third parties, or that we will use all available security technologies to prevent unauthorized access to, use, or disclosure of your personally identifying information.  While we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard your Personal Information while it is being transmitted or used by third parties, we do not warrant that your Personal Information will be transmitted without unauthorized interception or modification or that your Personal Information will not be access or compromised by unauthorized third parties.  We may permanently delete or destroy any and all Personal Information at any time as determined by us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Except as otherwise provided in this Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">Comply with a law (or based upon our good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with a law);</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">Protect our rights or property; or</li>
<li style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">Enforce this Policy or any of our other policies and guidelines.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Always remember to sign off the Sites and close your browser window when you are finished using it. This helps prevent others from posing as you online. This is especially important if you use a system that is accessible to others, such as the library, at school, at the workplace or at an Internet café to access the Sites.</p>
<p><strong>10. Cookies, Advertisements and Third Party Websites</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">Our Sites may contain links to other websites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.  We may allow third-party advertisers to place ads on our Sites.  These third-party advertisers may use cookies or similar technologies to help present the advertisements to you or to help measure the effectiveness of their advertisements.  Some advertisers may use cookies or other tracking technologies to serve ads based on your visits to the Sites and other websites on the Internet.  The use of such technologies is subject to the privacy policies of the third-party advertisers and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.  As a result, if you respond to any such third-party advertisers by clicking on the advertisements and/or visiting their websites or the websites of any other third party, be sure you evaluate their privacy policies before providing them any of your information.  To opt-out of a third party’s use of cookies, you must visit such third party’s website and follow its specified opt-out procedures.  You can learn more about one of our partners, Google, and how they use your data by visiting: <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/">http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.  You may opt-out of Google’s use of the DoubleClick cookie by visiting the Google Advertising Policies and Principles page at <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/</a>.  You can opt out of some, but not all, third-party advertiser cookies in one location at the Network Advertising Initiative opt-out website, located at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a>.  You may block all cookies by following the instructions applicable to your browser at <a href="http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-1">http://www.aboutcookies.org/page-1</a>.</p>
<p><strong>11. Hashed Email Sharing</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 50px;">We may provide one-way secured (or “hashed”) versions of your email address or similar identifying information to certain third parties to provide more relevant and customized experiences and advertising to you as you browse the Sites or other third party websites.  This hashed version of your email address is a text string that uniquely identifies your email address, but which is designed to prevent reverse engineering so that a third party should be unable to utilize the actual underlying email address, but merely to identify you as a unique user across devices, sessions, and browsers if you provide the same identifying information. If you provide a third party’s website with the same identifying information and that third party utilizes the same method of hashing it is possible that the third party could match information obtained from us and combine it with information that you provide to the third party website. You can also learn more about one of our partners, ALC, that may receive hashed emails and how to opt-out of their targeted services by visiting: <a href="https://optoutpreference.org/">https://optoutpreference.org/</a>.</p>
