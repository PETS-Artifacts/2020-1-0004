                    <p><strong>Timeframe</strong> – We will only retain your personal information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
                    <p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal information, the purposes for which we process your personal information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
                    <p>If you have an account with us your Personal Information will be kept by us for as long as your account remains active. If you deactivate your account your personal information will be kept for a reasonable period of time after this so that we can complete any activities already initiated or where we have a need to retain your personal information for legal or technical reasons (including back-up systems) for example to retain proof of transactions for the enforcement of our rights, and to enable the other party to a transaction to access records of past purchases or sales. Following this period we will either delete the information or change it to a form that does not identify you.</p>
                    <p>For details of retention periods for other aspects of your personal information please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:data@depop.com">data@depop.com</a></strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong>Transfers outside of the UK</strong> – the personal information we collect may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the EEA including to our affiliates and our third party Service moderators. It may also be processed by staff (who work for us or for one of our suppliers) and other users of the Service operating outside the EEA, in order to fulfil a purchase, process payment details and provide support and verification services. Some of these jurisdictions offer differing levels of protection in respect of personal information and may, in certain instances, be less protective than the UK. However the transfer of your data to other countries in line with this Privacy Policy, shall only be to countries in respect of which an adequacy decision has been issued by the European Commission, or where the entity is bound an appropriate confidentiality and data transfer agreement as deemed adequate by the European Commission (details of which we are happy to share with you on request as per the "<a href="#contacting-us">Contacting Us</a>" section below). Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal information shared between Europe and the US. We will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted through our Service; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>

            <p><strong>Right to object to processing:</strong> You may object to use processing your personal information where we are relying on a legitimate interest where you believe it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.

            <p><strong>Right to restriction of processing:</strong> You may ask us to suspend the processing of your personal information in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; © where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
            <p><strong>Right to request the transfer of your information:</strong> You have the right to request a transfer of certain of your personal information to you or a third party of your choice, which we will provide in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p>
