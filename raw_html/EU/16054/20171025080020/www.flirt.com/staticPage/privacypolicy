Email for Customer services: support@flirt.com<br><br>
<br><br>
We  operate a large number of social, dating, lifestyle and entertainment sites (including mobile applications/apps) through our Group Companies and Partner Sites. We refer to our sites and apps as, collectively, the “Services” within this policy. Some of our terms will make reference to our Group Companies or Partner Sites and any reference in this policy to “us” or “we” or “our” will include our Group Companies and Partner Sites.
<br><br>

<b>(a) ABOUT OUR GROUP COMPANIES</b><br>
As a large organisation we have a number of subsidiary and sister companies ("Group Companies") that operate some of our sites on our behalf or provide services to us to enable us to provide the Services to you. For data protection purposes, these companies are called data processors. Our Group Companies are all wholly/majorly operated by us, or our parent company.
<br><br>

<b>(b) ABOUT OUR PARTNER SITES</b><br>
If you are reading this policy you are using one of our sites or apps. We have an extensive network of sites that we categorise as casual sites (for adults looking for short-term consensual casual relationships). We want to offer you a full range of products and services and in order to do that we will share your details across our Partner Sites (See below <b>Creation of duplicate profiles across our Partner Sites</b>) and we will market our different products and services to you (See below <b>Marketing</b>). You authorise us to reproduce and broadcast the information contained in your profile including your name, photograph, "chat up line", description etc. throughout all or part of our Partner Sites and our Group Companies for the purposes of delivering the Services to you. 
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>2. YOUR RIGHTS TO ACCESS/AMEND THE DATA WE HOLD ON YOU & OPT OUT</b>
<br><br>
<b>(a) Accessing the data we hold on you</b><br>
If you want to know what data we hold on you, you have a legal right to obtain this information from us. You can make a Subject Access Request at any time, in writing, by following this simple process. By law, we have up to 40 days to respond to you and reserve the right to make a small charge for this service.
To make a Subject Access Request, please write to us enclosing a photocopy of a photographic ID (e.g. passport or driving licence) and utility bill (to provide proof of your address). This is to ensure we only send your data to you, or a third party that you expressly authorise in writing to deal with for you.
Please write to us at the address stated above if you wish to make a subject access request.
<br><br>

<b>(b) Amending/correcting the data we hold on you</b><br>
If you want to amend the data we hold that’s also very easy to do. We want to make sure we have everything right so please simply contact us at support@flirt.com to make any amendments to our records.
<br><br>

<b>(c) Changing your consent and opting out</b><br>
It’s ok to change your mind about what data you are allowing us to keep and what you don’t want us to keep. You can amend your settings through your account at any time, or contact our Support team.
We have to advise you however, that opting out of some data processing/storage will result in a loss of functionality of the sites and a reduced user experience.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>3. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</b>
<br><br>
We may collect and process different types of information about you. Some of this data is considered to be Personal Data (that means you can be identified by it including Sensitive Personal Data) and Anonymous Data (that is data that you cannot be identified from).

<br><br>

<b>(c) Data we collect/you upload from your activity across our Services</b><br>

<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 40px ">
  <li> Any information you populate your profile with including photographs (see also – <b>Important Notice about how we use your photos</b>);</li>

  <li> Usage data about how you use our site, this is what we consider Anonymous Data, which we collect using Cookies (see more details below – <b>Our Cookie Policy</b>).</li>
</ul>
<br><br>

<b>(d) Information we collect from other social networks that you use</b><br>
Some of our Services have the ability to link your use of the Services to other social networks you might have access to. If you have an account with another social network e.g. Facebook, you can share the data you have on our site with that network. To enhance your experience and create a personalised service we may ask you to login to your Facebook account. By doing so you grant us access to your information stored on your Facebook profile including without limitation your personal information, photographs, videos, interests and locations. When you login to the other network or install our app, we will receive the basic information from you including but not limited to your name, photos, gender, networks, user ID, friends list and any other information you make public and your email address. If you have logged into other social networks and linked them to any of our profiles you grant permission for us to post updates, including location information, on your behalf therefore please exercise caution. You can turn off location data – see below.
<br><br>

<b>(e) Information we collect about your location</b><br>
We can collect location data from your computer and/or mobile device. When accessing the Services from a mobile device you will be given the option to allow location sharing with our application. If you do not wish to share your location data with us please turn off this feature by following your mobile device instructions to do so. We can track your IP address if you are using a computer to access the Services. If you are using a mobile device we use GPS with an accuracy range of 20 to 100 metres. Although location data is anonymous and can’t identify you, it can be shown to other users so please exercise caution if you do not wish to publicise your location. If you choose to change or turn off location sharing, in order to provide you with a more localised service and localised matches, we will show you as being at a randomly generated location within the postal code area that you have provided. We also use your location data to research our own Services, develop new products and improve our Services, including using third parties to help us either provide the Services to you or develop new ones, and target advertising to suit your user experience. Your devices can give us lots of information about the device including the brand, model, version of operating system, installed app details, email accounts, mobile carrier and so on. We may also connect your account with location data from Foursquare and can show your Foursquare check ins on our map within some of our Services.
<br><br>

<b>(f) Information we collect about your Contacts</b><br>
Some features of the Services allow you to share your user experience with people you know (“your Contacts”), or to invite them to join the Services. When given the option to do so you can choose to upload your Contacts information; we will request their name and email address. If you give us your password to upload these Contacts through a web based email provider we shall not store your password after you have uploaded your Contacts’ addresses. You may also choose to invite friends through your connected social networks. You assume all responsibility for ensuring that when you select a friend to be invited by email, application or SMS that the person wants to receive that invite from you.

We will not store your Contacts information after invitations (up to a maximum of 3) have been sent.

<i><b>Legal disclosures</b></i><br>
We may be required by law e.g. through potential or actual litigation, court order, public or governmental authorities, or rules and regulations within or out with your country of residence to disclose all or part of your information to third parties.

<br><br>

<i><b>Change of ownership of the business</b></i><br>

In such transactions, the information we have collected about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy and through your use of the services (including payment activity and billing methods) will generally be one of the transferred business assets.

<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>6. WHERE WE STORE YOUR DATA</b>
<br><br>
The personal data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a location outside the European Economic Area (<b>'EEA'</b>) including but not limited to Canada where we host our servers. It may also be processed by law enforcement agencies, employees and independent contractors of our Group Companies located outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers (for example, staff who are involved in providing services that you order from us, processing your payment details or providing support services to us). By submitting your personal data to us, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>7. HOW LONG WE KEEP YOUR DATA FOR</b>
<br><br>
Generally speaking, we only store data for as long as it is necessary to provide products and Services to you and others, with information typically being held until you cancel your membership. <br>
For data storage purposes however our users are considered as either being: <br>
(a) Active Users; this means you regularly log on to our Services and use the Services in any way;<br>
(b) Inactive Users: this means that you have not cancelled your account but you haven’t logged in for 9 months, or conducted any activity on our Services in that time;<br>
(c) Cancelled: this means that you have followed our cancellation process and actively cancelled your membership.<br>
(d) Deactivated: this means that you have chosen to make your profile temporarily invisible to other users.
<br><br>
<b>(a) Active Users</b><br>
If you are an Active User we will store your data until you cancel your account.
<br><br>
<b>(b) Inactive Users</b><br>
If you are an Inactive User, you should be aware that we will continue to store your data until you cancel you account, including continue to market to you if you have consented to marketing. Just because you haven’t logged on for a few months, we hope you will return to use the Services regularly and we want your information to be there for your convenience so you should be aware that you will still appear in our search results for other users, and your profile will remain visible. The responsibility to change your preferences or cancel your account lies with you.
<br><br>
<b>(c) Cancelled Users</b><br>
If you are a Cancelled User, we will delete all of your data 9 months after the date of cancellation. It is important that we retain your data for this short period after cancellation to ensure that we can answer any payment or other account related queries, or provide information to third parties in line with our disclosure provisions outlined in this policy e.g. assisting police investigations. Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account, copies of that information may still be viewable and/or accessed on the Internet to the extent such information has been previously shared with others, or copied or stored by other users or to the extent such information has been shared with search engines. We cannot control this, nor do we accept any liability for this. If you have given third party applications or websites access to your personal information they may retain such information to the extent permitted under their terms of service or privacy policies.
<br><br>
<b>(d) Deactivated users</b><br>
If you select to 'Deactivate my account' / 'Hide my profile' in the account settings this is considered to mean that you have deactivated your account. Your profile and personal data will continue to be stored, allowing you to reactivate your account. When you use this option, your account / profile will be temporarily invisible to other users, and will remain so until you cancel your account or reactivate your profile. To re-activate your profile simply login again and your profile will be automatically re-activated.  De-activating your profiles does NOT cancel your paid subscriptions, to ensure you are not further charged you must properly cancel your account, not simply de-activate it. For cancelling your membership please contact our support <script type="text/javascript">

<b>8A. HOW WE KEEP YOUR DATA SECURE</b>
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. We take reasonable administrative, physical, and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access or disclosure. This includes using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts the personal information you input, and storing your information in encrypted form behind a firewall designed to block access from outside our network. Although we use commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of your information, transmissions on the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. Moreover, we cannot assure you that your personal information that we collect will not be used or disclosed inconsistently with this privacy policy. We assume no responsibility or liability for disclosure of any of your information due to errors in transmission, unauthorized third-party access, or other causes beyond our reasonable control.
<br><br>
<br><br>

<b>8B. HOW YOU CAN HELP KEEP YOUR OWN DATA SECURE</b>
<br><br>
We have designed the Website to make it easy for you to find, connect, and interact with other members of the Website by posting information about yourself. You can also use our electronic messaging system, which allows you to communicate with other users provided you are both subscribers. We recommend and encourage you (and all our members) to think carefully about the information they disclose about themselves. We also do not recommend that you put email addresses, URLs, instant messaging details, phone numbers, full names or addresses, credit card details, national identity numbers, drivers’ license details, and other sensitive information in your profile, which is open to abuse and misuse.<br>
Please be careful about posting sensitive details about yourself on your profile such as your religious denomination and health details. While you may voluntarily provide this information to us when you create your profile, including your sexual preferences and ethnic background, there is no requirement to do so. Please remember that photographs or any video clips that you post on the Website may reveal these kinds of sensitive personal data. Where you do upload and choose to tell us sensitive information about yourself, you are explicitly consenting to our processing your information and making this public to other users. <br>
When you post information about yourself or use the messaging service, the amount of personal information you share is at your own risk. In addition, these postings may appear on other websites or in searches on the subject matter of your posting. Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly viewable webpages, you make that information publicly available and others can collect and use that information. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited email messages. If you post anything that is inconsistent with our terms, we reserve the right to terminate your account.
