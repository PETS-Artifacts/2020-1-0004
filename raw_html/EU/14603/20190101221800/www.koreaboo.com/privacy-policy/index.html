		<h2>Privacy Notice and Cookies</h2>
<h3>Last updated: May 2018</h3>
<p>Please read our Privacy Notice carefully as it describes our collection, use, disclosure, retention and protection of your personal information.

We may do this using cookies or similar technologies (as described in section 6 below).</p>
<p>We may enhance personal information we collect from you with information we obtain from third parties that are entitled to share that information; for example, information from data management platforms, but in each case as permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<p>If you intend giving us personal information about someone else, you are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any obligation and consent obligations under applicable data protections laws. In so far as required by applicable data protection laws, you must ensure that beforehand you have their explicit consent to do so and that you explain to them how we collect, use, disclose and retain their personal information or direct them to read our Privacy Notice.</p>
<h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
<p>To the extent permissible under applicable law, we use your information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide any information and services that you have requested or services that you have ordered;</li>

<li>monitor, measure, improve and protect our content, website, and services and provide an enhanced, personal, user experience for you;</li>

<li>deliver targeted advertising, marketing or information to you;</li>
<li>deliver joint content and services with third parties with whom you have a separate relationship (for example, social media providers); and</li>
<li>provide you with location based services (for example, advertising and other personalised content), where we collect geo-location data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our website, (including mobile applications) and services may contain technology that enables us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>check specific information from your device or systems directly relevant to your use of the websites, or services against our records to make sure the websites, or services are being used in accordance with our end-user agreements and to troubleshoot any problems;</li>
<li>obtain information relating to any technical errors or other issues with our website and services;</li>
<li>collect information about how you and users use the functions of the features of our website and services; and</li>

<p>You can manage your privacy settings within your browser or our website and services (where applicable).</p>
<p>In addition to the purposes described in this section 3, we may also use information we gather to deliver targeted advertising, marketing or information to you which may be useful, based on your use of the website or services or any other information we have about you (depending on the websites or services, you may able to configure these features to suit your preferences). Sections 5 and 6 of this Privacy Notice provides further details on how we will do this.</p>
<p>We may monitor and record our communications with you, including e-mails and phone conversations.

<p><strong>Mobile data</strong></p>
<p>We may obtain information through mobile applications that you install on your mobile devices. These mobile applications may be our own mobile applications or those belonging to third parties. Where the mobile application belongs to a third party, you must read that third party’s own privacy notice as it will apply to your use of that third party mobile application. We are not responsible for such third party mobile applications and their use of your personal information.</p>
<p>Mobile applications may provide us with information related to a user’s use of that mobile application and use of our applications and services accessed using that mobile application.

<ul>
<li>customer relationship management software to provide you with any information, products or services that you have requested;</li>
<li>our service providers and agents (including their sub-contractors) or third parties which process information on our behalf (e.g. internet service and platform providers, advertising agencies, agency trading desks, supply side platforms and data management platforms) so that they may help us to provide you with the products, services and information you have requested or which we believe is of interest to you;</li>
<li>partners, including website and mobile app publishers, resellers and developers that may help us to provide you with the products, services and information you have requested or which we believe is of interest to you;</li>
<li>third parties where you have a relationship with that third party and you have consented to us sending information (for example social media sites or other third party application providers);</li>

<li>credit reference and fraud prevention agencies;</li>
<li>law enforcement agencies so that they may detect or prevent crime or prosecute offenders;</li>
<li>any third party in the context of actual or threatened legal proceedings, provided we can do so lawfully (for example in response to a court order);</li>

</ul>
<p>We may share non-personally identifiable information about the use of our website, applications, products or services publicly or with third parties but this will not include information that can be used to identify you.</p>
<h2>5. Marketing</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may use your information to contact you with details about our products and services which we feel may be of interest to you. We may also share your information with other companies and carefully selected third parties so that they (or we) may contact you with information about their products or services which we feel may be of interest to you. You have the right at any time to stop us from contacting you for marketing purposes. You may also request at any time that we do not share your information with third parties referred to in this paragraph. If you wish to exercise these rights you can do so by selecting your contact preferences at the point where you provide us with your information on our websites or services, using any preference centres we give you access to or by sending us an email to privacy@koreaboo.com. You can also unsubscribe from any email marketing using the links provided in the emails we send to you.</p>
<h2>6. Your information and your rights</h2>
<p>If you are based within the EEA or within another jurisdiction having similar data protection laws, in certain circumstances you have the following rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to be told how we use your information and obtain access to your information;</li>
<li>the right to have your information rectified or erased or place restrictions on processing your information;</li>
<li>the right to object to the processing of your information e.g. for direct marketing purposes;</li>
<li>the right to have any information you provided to us on an automated basis returned to you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, or sent directly to another company, where technically feasible (“data portability”);</li>
<li>where the processing of your information is based on your consent, the right to withdraw that consent subject to legal or contractual restrictions;</li>
<li>the right to object to any decisions based on the automated processing of your personal data, including profiling; and</li>
<li>the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority responsible for data protection matters (e.g. in the UK, the Information Commissioner’s Office).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you request a copy of your information you may be required to pay a statutory fee.</p>
<p>If we hold any information about you which is incorrect or if there are any changes to your details, please let us know by so that we can keep our records accurate and up to date.</p>
<p>If you withdraw your consent to the use of your personal information for purposes set out in our Privacy Notice, we may not be able to provide you with access to all or parts of our website and services.</p>
<p>We will retain your personal information for the duration of our business relationship and afterwards for as long as is necessary and relevant for our legitimate business purposes, in accordance with our data retention, marking and destruction policy or as otherwise permitted applicable laws and regulation. Where we no longer need your personal information, we will dispose of it in a secure manner (without further notice to you).</p>
<h2>7. Changes to our privacy notice</h2>
<p>We may change our Privacy Notice from time to time. However we will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Notice. We will always update this Privacy Notice on our website, so please try to read it when you visit the website (the ‘last updated’ reference tells you when we last updated our Privacy Notice).</p>
<h2>8. Security and storage of information</h2>
<p>We will keep your information secure by taking appropriate technical and organisational measures against its unauthorised or unlawful processing and against its accidental loss, destruction or damage. We will do our best to protect your personal information but we cannot guarantee the security of your information which is transmitted to our website or services or to other website, applications and services via an internet or similar connection. If we have given you (or you have chosen) a password to access certain areas of our websites or services please keep this password safe – we will not share this password with anyone.</p>
<p>If you believe your account has been compromised, please contact us at privacy@koreaboo.com.</p>
<h2>9. Transfers outside of the European Economic Area</h2>
<p>Personal information in the European Union is protected by data protection laws but other countries do not necessarily protect your personal information in the same way.</p>
<p>Our website and some of our applications or services or parts of them may also be hosted in the United States or otherwise outside of the EEA (which means all the EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) (“EEA”) and this means that we may transfer any information which is submitted by you through the website or the application or service outside the EEA to the United States or to other territories outside of the EEA. When you send an email to us, this will also be stored on email servers which are hosted with Google and therefore may be outside of the EEA.</p>
<p>We may use service providers based outside of the EEA to help us provide our website and services to you and this means that we may transfer your information to service providers outside the EEA for the purpose of providing our advertising and services to you.</p>
