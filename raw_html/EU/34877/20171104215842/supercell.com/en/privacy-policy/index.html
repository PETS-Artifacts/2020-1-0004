        <p><strong>Mobile Applications</strong></p>
        <p>When you use any of the Supercell games or applications on a mobile platform, we may record certain information and data, such as your application usage, access, session times and in-app purchases, your unique device ID (persistent / non-persistent), hardware type, media access control ("MAC") address, international mobile equipment identity ("IMEI"), the version of your operating system ("OS"), your device name, your email address (if you have connected to Facebook or Google+), and your location (based on your Internet Protocol ("IP") address).&nbsp; This information is useful to us for troubleshooting and helps us understand usage trends and improve and optimize the Services and your user experience, and may also be utilized for other purposes, such as interest based advertising as described elsewhere in this Policy.</p>
        <p>In addition, we create a unique user ID to track your use of our Service.&nbsp; This unique user ID is stored in connection with your profile information to track the Supercell games you are playing.</p>
        <p>We may occasionally send you push notifications through our mobile applications to send you game updates, high scores and other service related notifications that may be of importance to you.&nbsp; You may at any time opt-out from receiving these types of communications by turning them off at the device level through your settings.</p>
        <p>With only your express consent, we or our partners may collect your precise location based information (GPS) for the purpose of matching you with opponent players in your local area, to tailor content specific to your area (such as event announcements), to show your location to other players, and to match your device location to certain points of interest for purposes of interest based advertising as described elsewhere in this Policy. Other players in our game may then be able to see that you are available to play a game when you participate in specific areas of our games. Please note, participation in this part of the Service is not a requirement for all gameplay in our games, but it may be a requirement for example to participate in local gameplay with others in your area. </p>
        <p><strong>Advertising</strong></p>
        <p>We may feature advertisements in our games and elsewhere, both ourselves and with the help of our partners, and collect and use data and information about you and your device (including the presence of applications on the device or in use at a particular time on the device) in connection with such advertising, including your viewing of and interaction with any such advertising, in order to deliver, enable, target and optimize advertising and promotional information that is more relevant to you and is based on your game and device usage, online behavior and interests (this is commonly referred to as online behavioral or interest based advertising). We and our partners may also use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track the content you access or your device location for purposes of interest based advertising. The privacy policies of our partners may include additional terms and disclosures regarding  their data collection and use practices and tracking technologies , and we encourage you to check those privacy policies to learn more about their data collection and use practices, use of cookies and other similar tracking technologies.</p>
        <p>Advertisers on mobile devices and our third party advertising and analytics partners sometimes collect and use Advertising IDs to enable and optimize advertising. Advertising IDs are non-permanent device identifiers such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising. </p>
        <p>These advertisers and third party advertising and analytics partners may collect and use data and information about you, such as your Service session activity, viewing of and interaction with an advertisement, device identifier, MAC address, IMEI, geo-location information and IP address for the purposes of analyzing, tracking and measuring advertisement performance and to provide interest based advertising. </p>
        <p>In addition, you may see our games advertised in other services. &nbsp;After clicking on one of these advertisements and installing our game, you will become a user of our Service. &nbsp;In order to verify the installs, a device identifier may be shared with the advertiser or third party advertiser or analytics partner.</p>
        <p><strong>Choices Regarding Ad Targeting and Data Use</strong></p>
        <p>You may click on the following link:<a href="http://supercell.com/en/partner-opt-out/"> http://www.supercell.com/partner-opt-out</a> for information on how to opt-out of the delivery of interest based advertising as well as certain uses of precise location. Please note, you will still receive generic ads.</p>
        <p>You can exercise an opt-out for interest based advertising services on mobile applications by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074">"limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS)</a>&nbsp;or "<a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248?hl=en">opt-out of interest based ads" (Android)</a>. If you would like to adjust your choices regarding the use of precise location data, you may also do so via your mobile device settings. </p>
        <p><strong>Finally, </strong>many of our partner's that enable online behavioral or interest based advertising are members of one or more digital advertising industry self-regulatory programs. You may click below for the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI") and Digital Advertising Alliance ("DAA") to learn more about targeted or interest based advertising and to opt out of certain targeting programs.</p>
