</p>
<p>
    BoyzTube ("We, and "Us") respects the privacy of its users ("You") and has
    developed this Privacy Policy to demonstrate its commitment to protecting
    your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the information we collect, how
    that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices
    about such uses and disclosures. We encourage you to read this Privacy
    Policy carefully when using or services and transacting business with us.
    By using our website or application (our Service), you are accepting the
    practices described in the Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    You can contact us about this Privacy Policy using the contact info below.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Information we collect about you.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.1 In General.</strong>
    When you use BoyzTube, we automatically collect and store information about
    your computer or mobile device and your use of the site or app. We may
    collect information that can identify you including but not limited to you
    name, email address, mobile device ID number, your preferences, technical
    information about your computer and mobile devices (personal information)
    and other information that does not identify you. By using our service, you
    are authorising us to gather, parse, and retain data related to the
    provision of that service. When you provide personal information through
    our service, the information may be sent to servers located in the United
    Kingdom and countries around the world.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1.2 Information you provide.</strong>
    To be a customer of BoyzTube, you will be asked to register. If you do so,
    you authorize us to collect information from your device automatically
    (such as location), and store identifying information you provide, such as
    your name, address, email address, and telephone number, and when you make
    a purchase, financial information. If you chat with or contact us with a
    customer service or other inquiry, you will allow us to store the content
    of that communications.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Use of technologies to collect information.</strong>
    We use various technologies to collect information from your device and
    about your use of our service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.1 Information collected automatically.</strong>
    We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you
    visit BoyzTube. This information could include your IP address, device ID
    and type, your browser type and language, the operating system used by your
    device, access times, your mobile devices geographic location while our
    application is actively running, and the referring website address.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.2 Cookies and user of cookie date. </strong>
    When you visit BoyzTube, we may assign your device one or more cookies to
    facilitate access to our service and personalize your experience. Through
    use of a cookie, we also may automatically collect information about your
    use of our service, such as the pages you visit, the time and date of your
    visits and the links you click.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2.3 Third party Cookies. </strong>
    We may partner with third parties that collect information across various
    channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more
    relevant advertising and content to you. Our partner may place or recognize
    a cookie on your computer or device and we may share personal information
    with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your email
    address. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them
    to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect
    information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and
    version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use
    this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms
    over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes.
    For example, our partners may deliver and/or enable downstream delivery of
    an ad to you in your web browser based on a purchase you made in a physical
    retail store, or they may send a personalized marketing email to you based
    on the fact that you visited a particular website. To learn more about
interest-based advertising in general and to opt-out, please visit    <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices/">https://www.youronlinechoices</a>

    viewed, or to measure the popularity of our features and services.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. How we use the information we collect.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3.1 In General.</strong>

    - perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our or
    others products, services, or content;
</p>
<p>
    - communicate with you by email, postal, mail, telephone and/or mobile
    devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either
    from us or other third parties;
</p>
<p>
    - develop, display, and track content and advertising tailored to your
    interests on our products and other sites, including providing our
    advertisements to you with you visit other sites;
</p>
<p>
    -website or mobile application analytics;
</p>
<p>
    - verify your eligibility and deliver prizes in connection with
    competitions, discounts, and promotions;
</p>
<p>
    - enforce or exercise any rights in our <u>Terms and Conditions</u>and
    perform functions or services as otherwise described to you at the time of
    collection.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. With whom we share your information.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.1 Personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated
    in this Privacy Policy or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to
    opt out of having your personal information shared. We may share personal
    information with:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.1.1 Service providers.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may share information, including personal and financial information,
    with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These
    services may include providing customer service and marketing assistance,
    performing business and sales analysis, ad tracking and analytics, member
    screenings, supporting our service functionality, and supporting contests,
    sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our service. These
    service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform
    their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for
    any other purposes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4.1.2 Other situations.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may disclose your information, including personal information:
</p>
<p>
    - In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order,
    or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government
    agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal
    claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or
    waive any legal objection or right available to us.
</p>
<p>
    -When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to
    investigate, prevent, or take other actions regarding illegal activity,
    suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights,
    property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to
    comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce
    our <u>Terms and Conditions</u>, other agreements or policies.
</p>
<p>
    - In connections with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale
    of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in
    the unlikely event of bankruptcy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. Do Not Track Disclosure</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in their
    web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that
    they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected
    over time and across websites and online services. We are committed to
    providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and
    that is why we provide the opt-out links above. However, we do not
    recognise or respond to any DNT signals, as the internet industry works
    toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT,
    and a common approach to responding to DNT.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>6. Third party websites</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are places on our service where you may click on a link to access
    other websites that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. For example,
    if you click on an advertisement on our site, or a competition entry, you
    may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party
    websites may independently solicit and collect information, including
    personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with
    information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you
    consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by
    clicking on the privacy link typically located at the bottom of the
    webpage you are visiting.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>7. How you can access your information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you are a customer of BoyzTube, you will have set up an account. You
    will be able to review and update your personal information at any time by
    logging into the website, and visiting Settings. If you close your
    account, we will retain certain information associated with your account
    for analytical purposes and record keeping integrity, as well as to prevent
    fraud, enforce or take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity
    of our service or our customers, or take other action otherwise permitted
    by law. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to
    third-parties as described in the Privacy Policy, retention of that
    information will be subject to those third parties policies.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        8. Your choices about collection and user of your information
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.1.</strong>
    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may
    result in you being unable to user certain features of our service because
    such information may be required in order for you to register, to purchase
    products, participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask
    a question; or initiate other transactions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>8.2.</strong>
    You can also control information collected by cookies. You can delete or
    decline cookies by changing your browser settings. Click help in the
    toolbar of most browsers for instructions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>9. How we protect your personal information</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We take security measures to help safeguard your personal information from
    unauthorised access and disclosure. However, no system can be completely
    secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do
    not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, or
    other communications will remain secure. Customers should also take care
    with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should
    avoid sending personal information through insecure email. There is a
    reason we pay for the more secure communication tools on the service.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>10. Adult Restricted</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above. We do
    not knowingly collect, maintain, or use personal information from
    individuals under the age of 18.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>11. Visiting our service from outside the EU</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If you are visiting our service from outside the EU, please be aware that
    your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the EU
    where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By
    using our services, you understand and agree that your information may be
    transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it
    as described in this privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>12. No Rights of Third Parties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or
    require disclosure of any personal information relating to users of the
    website.
</p>
<p>
