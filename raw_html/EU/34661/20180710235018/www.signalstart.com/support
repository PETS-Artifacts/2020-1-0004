That's why it is always best to leave it to the professionals - with Signal Start your account is connected and monitored 24/5 while you can do whatever you wish - all for a small monthly fee which is more than worth it.

Signal Start is designed to copy trades which meet the slippage criteria (3 pips default). If a trade cannot be copied, it will be retried until successful or invalid - this ensures optimal trade syncing and even in some cases, better entries than the signal.

                                        When you subscribe to a signal, you can change the multiplier value (either at subscribing or afterwards in your management screen); changing this value will show you immediately the hypothetical return and risk you could have based on the data gathered so far. A multiplier of value 1 means you're getting the same risk ratio as the provider.

                                        Risk is the maximal drawdown of the subscribed systems and appears in the risk - it ranges from 0% to 100%. When you adjust the multiplier of each system, you will notice the risk bar adjusting accordingly, showing you the total risk in real time.<br/><br/>

                                        As a signal provider, you pay the $25 service fee for connecting your account to Signal Start and a 30% fee from your listing price for any subscription (deducted from payments due to you).

                                        We charge signal providers a setup fee because master and slave accounts are hosted in the same data center and in the same private network with super fast 1Gbps switches so latency is minimal (as well as slippage).

<br/>
Each time you use the website, the current version of the Terms and Conditions
will apply. Accordingly, when you use the website, you should check the date of the
Terms and Conditions (which appears at the bottom) and review any changes since the last version.

Please review carefully the entire website Terms and Conditions before agreeing to them.

The term Signal Start or "us" or "we" refers to the owner of the website

<br>The use of this website is subject to the following terms of use: <br/> <br/>

<br/>

<ul class="news">
    <li>
        All performance claims found on Signal Start about trading systems or strategies must be regarded as hypothetical. Use of Signal Start to offer or subscribe to a trading system or strategy indicates you agree to our Terms and Conditions. Before using any systems or strategies
        listed on Signal Start you
        should be aware that there is often a vast difference between hypothetical results and real-life trading results achievable in a real brokerage account, and real-live results are almost always vastly worse than hypothetical results. Performance results for systems and strategies
        listed on
        Signal Start do not take into account fees, spreads and/or trading commissions that may be charged by your broker or a money manager. Please consult with your broker for information on these costs. Additional information on how Signal Start calculates performance data can be
        found on the Signal Start <a
            class="underline" href="http://www.signalstart.com/support">FAQ</a> page.
    </li>
    <li>
        HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS HAVE MANY INHERENT LIMITATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. NO REPRESENTATION IS BEING MADE THAT ANY ACCOUNT WILL OR IS LIKELY TO ACHIEVE PROFITS OR LOSSES SIMILAR TO THOSE SHOWN. IN FACT, THERE ARE FREQUENTLY SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
        HYPOTHETICAL
        PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND THE ACTUAL RESULTS SUBSEQUENTLY ACHIEVED BY ANY PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM. ONE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS IS THAT THEY ARE GENERALLY PREPARED WITH THE BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT. IN ADDITION, HYPOTHETICAL TRADING DOES NOT INVOLVE
        FINANCIAL RISK,
        AND NO HYPOTHETICAL TRADING RECORD CAN COMPLETELY ACCOUNT FOR THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL RISK IN ACTUAL TRADING. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ABILITY TO WITHSTAND LOSSES OR ADHERE TO A PARTICULAR TRADING PROGRAM IN SPITE OF TRADING LOSSES ARE MATERIAL POINTS WHICH CAN ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT
        ACTUAL TRADING
        RESULTS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO THE MARKETS IN GENERAL OR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY SPECIFIC TRADING PROGRAM WHICH CANNOT BE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PREPARATION OF HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE RESULTS AND ALL OF WHICH CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT ACTUAL TRADING
        RESULTS.
