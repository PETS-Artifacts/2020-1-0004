<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>4.6. Your experience at Brussels Airport</strong></p>

<p><em>4.6.1. Statutory obligations and tasks in the public interest</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;"><strong>Protection of civil aviation. </strong>Following international and European legislation regarding civil aviation and related safety and security thereof, Brussels Airport carries out preventative security checks on passengers and baggage in the terminal. Brussels Airport has decided to outsource this task to specialized security companies. In the event any Personal Data of you is processed, it shall be done so for civil aviation security purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">Your boarding pass data shall be processed at the controlled access gates, <em>i.e. </em>the automatic boarding pass control, for the purpose of providing you legitimate access to the security restricted area of the airport. Access control checks shall also be performed on employees at Brussels Airport, whose badges shall be checked in order to gain access to the security restricted area of the airport.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;"><strong>Camera images.</strong> Your, as well as our staff&rsquo;s, safety and security at Brussels Airport is very important to us. Therefore, we make use of surveillance cameras and CCTV cameras. We will process camera images for the purposes of safety and security, to improve (safety) procedures, for flow management at the airport, incident resolution and management of (damage) claims, management of the goods and the operational process of machines of Brussels Airport, and for access control.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">We will not store the camera images for longer than thirty (30) days, unless an incident has occurred which can be resolved by means of the relevant camera images, in which case the images will not be stored for longer than necessary for incident resolution. Insofar as it is necessary to comply with statutory obligations, government bodies, such as the police and the courts, may receive camera images, which may include your Personal Data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;"><strong>Automated border control. </strong>The Schengen Borders Code requires the border police to perform a reinforced identity check of every passenger leaving or entering the Schengen area, where appropriate by using technical devices. In the event that you travel outside the Schengen area, you have to enter through one of the automated border control gates, where your passport information and picture shall be verified by scanning your facial characteristics in real-time. If both your passport picture and facial characteristics match, you shall be able to proceed to your gate. The system shall store your Personal Data solely during the transaction for the purpose of border control and providing you access. The system is managed by Brussels Airport, in its capacity as processor, on behalf of the border police, who is the controller of these data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;"><strong>Retailers. </strong>Retailers at Brussels Airport may ask to scan your boarding pass for different purposes. For example, to record whether a product was sold tax-free or taxable, which will depend on your destination, <em>i.e.</em> whether you travel within or outside the EU. As such retailers decide themselves for which purposes they collect your Personal Data, Brussels Airport shall not be responsible for the processing of your Personal Data by such retailers. In case you have any questions on this topic, we advise you to contact the relevant retailer directly. You can find the contact details of the retailers within Brussels Airport on our Website. Brussels Airport may however receive certain data from such retailers but solely for statistical purposes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>4.6.2. Optimisation of company processes and systems</em></p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">In order to optimize Brussels Airport&rsquo;s business processes, such as the baggage process and passenger process, and for the purpose of optimizing your travel experience at our airport, we may process your Personal Data. In case Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are enabled on your mobile device, we will track your passenger journey throughout our airport for statistical and analytical purposes, as well as for crowd management. If you do not wish to be tracked, you need to switch off your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on your mobile devices.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">Brussels Airport shall make use of infrared cameras and sensors to trace Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals for the purpose of measuring the number of passengers at certain locations within a certain timeframe. This enables us to give you information on expected peaks, queues and waiting times at the airport. We shall only process the unique Media Access Control (MAC) address of your mobile and wireless device(s), which does not link to any individual user data, thus Personal Data is not revealed.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">As a person passes a sensor, the active MAC address shall be linked between the several sensors set up in the airport to provide origin and destination data, as well as travel time. As concerns the infrared cameras, no images are made but merely the density of the crowd at a certain place and point in time is measured.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">The sensors make use of encryption techniques such as one-way hash, SSL Encryption and re-hashing in order to ensure your privacy. For more information on the security measures taken to ensure your privacy, and the manner of processing of your Personal Data, we refer to the privacy guarantee of BLIP Systems (<a href="http://www.blipsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BlipTrack-Privacy-Concerns.pdf">http://www.blipsystems.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/BlipTrack-Privacy-Concerns.pdf</a>).</p>

We shall in no event store your Personal Data, including the copy of your identity card, for longer as necessary.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;"><strong>iBeacons.</strong> Brussels Airport is equipped with iBeacons which send out signals to your mobile device when the Brussels Airport App has been downloaded and Bluetooth is activated. Your MAC address shall be processed in order to determine how long your mobile device is located in a certain area. However, we will not link such information to any individual user data, thus Personal Data is not revealed.

Such external market research companies shall process your Personal Data on our behalf, and we shall be in full control of what happens with your Personal Data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:14.2pt;">Depending on the type of market survey, we shall process your age, postal code, gender, nationality, country of origin and/or means of transport used to come to the airport. We shall solely process such Personal Data for statistical purposes and shall take appropriate technical and organizational measures to de-identify your Personal Data, where possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>5. Security</strong></h3>

<p>We shall take appropriate technical, organisational and administrative measures against unauthorized or unlawful processing of any of your Personal Data or its accidental loss, destruction or damage, access, disclosure or use.</p>

<p>In the event of a personal data breach (<em>e.g. </em>breach of security of the Personal Data, or access by an unauthorized person) at Brussels Airport in which your Personal Data is involved, we shall take all necessary measures to mitigate any consequences of such personal data breach, and to avoid such breach in the future. We are required by law to notify you if the personal data breach is likely to affect your fundamental rights and freedoms and constitutes a risk to your privacy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>6. Disclosure to Third Parties</strong></h3>

<p>We shall not sell, transfer or otherwise disclose your Personal Data to Third Parties without obtaining your prior explicit consent, unless set out otherwise in this privacy policy, and unless this is necessary for the Purpose(s) as set out in this privacy policy, or unless we are required to do so by law.</p>

<p>We may share Personal Data with cloud service providers and other service providers who help us provide, understand, commercialize and improve our business activities.

We ensure that the processed Personal Data is adequate, accurate, relevant and not excessive.

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right of access</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">If you are concerned about the Personal Data that is being processed of you, or if you have any questions regarding your Personal Data, you have the right to request access to the Personal Data which Brussels Airport processes or stores about you.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right to correct inaccurate Personal Data</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">We commit to keeping all of your Personal Data accurate and up-to-date, however, it is possible that sometimes we miss some updates. Therefore, you are granted the right to request us, free of charge, to rectify and correct any inaccuracies or incompleteness of your Personal Data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right to erasure</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Under certain predefined circumstances, you shall have the right to request the erasure of your Personal Data without undue delay. It shall be assessed by Brussels Airport on a case-by-case basis whether or not your request qualifies for the erasure of your Personal Data. In the event your request falls under one of the predefined circumstances, and no exceptions as set out in the GDPR apply, your Personal Data shall be erased out of the internal systems at Brussels Airport. However, it is possible that the deleted Personal Data remains temporarily stored in our Brussels Airport&rsquo;s back-up system. We shall take all reasonable steps to erase all Personal Data to the maximum extent possible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Closely related to your right to erasure, you shall also have the right to be forgotten in the event that your Personal Data has been made public. Your Personal Data shall then be erased out of the internal system, and reasonable technical and organisational measures shall be taken to erase all links to, and copies or reproductions of, the Personal Data.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right to restrict data processing</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">In certain predefined circumstances, you may request Brussels Airport to temporarily halt and restrict the processing of the Personal Data in question. It shall be assessed by Brussels Airport on a case-by-case basis whether or not your request qualifies for the restriction of processing. In the event that your request falls under one of the predefined circumstances, Brussels Airport may still store your Personal Data, however any other further processing of your Personal Data shall be restricted and may only be performed either with your consent, for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person, or for reasons of important public interest.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">In the event that the processing of your Personal Data is restricted following your request, we shall inform you before such restriction of processing is lifted.</p>

<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right to object to data processing </strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">In certain predefined circumstances, you may object to the processing of your Personal Data by Brussels Airport. This is in short when the processing is based upon public interest or legitimate interest, when the Personal Data is processed for direct marketing purposes, or when the Personal Data is processed for statistical purposes. It shall be assessed by Brussels Airport on a case-by-case basis whether or not your request to object to data processing meets the requirements.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">We may solely use your Personal Data to contact you through mail for direct marketing purposes in the event that you have explicitly consented hereto. If you have consented hereto in the past, and you no longer want to receive suggestions and/or direct marketing through mail, you may at any time oppose to such processing and unsubscribe from the mailing list.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right to data portability</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">In the event that your Personal Data is processed on the basis of your consent or on the basis of a contract, and the processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive all your Personal Data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. Where technically feasible, you may also request us to transmit such Personal Data directly to another controller without any hindrance insofar this does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;"><strong>My right not to be subject to automated individual decision-making, including profiling</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">In relation to your right to object to data processing, you shall have the right not to be subject to decisions based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produce legal effects for you, or similarly significantly affects you. However, you shall only have this right in certain predefined circumstances, and it shall be assessed by Brussels Airport on a case-by-case basis whether or not your request is eligible.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Automated processing is to be understood as processing performed by machines without human intervention, such as direct marketing, targeted advertising and e-recruitment processes which are performed electronically rather than by a human and based upon which decisions are made. In other words, in case of individual automated decision-making, there is no (significant) human intervention which could correct possible outcomes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">Profiling, on the other hand, is to be understood as the automated processing of your Personal Data to evaluate certain personal aspects (<em>e.g. </em>performance at work, personal preferences, interests, behaviour, location, movements) relating to you, in particular to be able to categorize you on the basis of your Personal Data. Based on these categorizations, (automated) individual decisions can then be made. Profiling shall be subject to the right not to be subject to automated individual decision-making in the event that the decision-making happens fully automated, without any (significant) human intervention which could correct the possible outcomes.</p>

<p style="margin-left:18.0pt;">&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How can you exercise your rights? </strong></p>
