<ul>
<li><strong>Within Bannerflow: </strong>Bannerflow may receive your personal data as necessary for the processing purposes described above.Depending on the categories of personal data and the purposes for which the personal data has been collected, different internal departments within the Bannerflow may receive your personal data. For example, our IT department may have access to your account data, and our customer success and sales departments may have access to your account data or data relating to product orders. Moreover, other departments within Bannerflow may have access to certain personal data about you on a need to know basis, such as the legal department, the finance department, or internal auditing.</li>
<li><strong>With data processors: </strong>Certain third parties, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, may receive your personal data to process such data under appropriate instructions (&#8220;<strong>Processors</strong>&#8220;) as necessary for the processing purposes described above, such as analytics service providers, order fulfilment providers, customer care providers, marketing service providers, IT support service providers, and other service providers who support us in maintaining our commercial relationship with you. The Processors will be subject to contractual obligations to implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to safeguard the personal data, and to process the personal data only as instructed.</li>
<li><strong>Other recipients: </strong>We may transfer – in compliance with applicable data protection law – personal data to law enforcement agencies, governmental authorities, judicial authorities, legal counsel, external consultants, or business partners. In case of a corporate merger or acquisition, personal data may be transferred to the third parties involved in the merger or acquisition.

<p><strong>International transfers. </strong>The personal data that we collect or receive about you may be transferred to and processed by recipients that are located inside or outside the European Economic Area (&#8220;<strong>EEA</strong>&#8220;). For recipients located outside of the EEA, some are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and others are located in countries with adequacy decisions, and, in each case, the transfer is thereby recognised as providing an adequate level of data protection from a European data protection law perspective.

We will take all necessary measures to ensure that transfers out of the EEA are adequately protected as required by applicable data protection law. With respect to transfers to countries not providing an adequate level of data protection, we will base the transfer on appropriate safeguards, such as standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission or by a supervisory authority, approved codes of conduct together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient, or approved certification mechanisms together with binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient. You can ask for a copy of such appropriate safeguards by contacting us as set out in Section 6 below.</p>

<p>Your personal data will be retained as long as necessary to provide you with the requested services. Once our relationship has ended, we will take steps to remove your personal data from our systems and records, anonymise it so that you can no longer be identified from it or otherwise see to that access to the personal data is highly restricted.
