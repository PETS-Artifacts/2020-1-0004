<h3><a name="1"></a>Your Consent</h3>
<p>By using the Website, you  consent to the collection and use of certain information in the manner we  describe and agree to be bound by the terms of use as set forth herein. By  logging into your cart, you consent to periodic email notifications regarding  the status of your check-out process. You may opt out of these any time after  your initial notice.</p>

<h3><a name="2"></a>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our  policies, we will post those changes on this Website. Information collected  before changes are made will be secured according to the Policy in place at the  time such information is collected notwithstanding future changes to this  Policy. The practices and policies in this Policy replace all previous notices  or statements with respect to the same subject matter. If we make any material  changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in  your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming  effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest  information on our privacy practices.</p>

<h3><a name="3"></a>Opt-out or Termination of User Accounts</h3>
<p>If users have opted out of  all communication with the Website, or deleted/deactivated their account,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mercola.com/">Mercola.com</a>&nbsp;will not contact such  users again nor will their personal information ever be used by us in any  manner.</p>

<h3><a name="4"></a>Contact Information</h3>
<p>If users  have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="5"></a>Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to  preventing others from unauthorized access to the personal information you  provide to us, and we maintain commercially reasonable procedures and  technology designed for this purpose. The Website has reasonable technical and  organizational security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, or  alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that  unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those security measures  or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
<p>When our registration/order  form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number,  that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry standard  software, 256-bit SSL . While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock  icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft  Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users  are just &quot;surfing.&quot;</p>
<p>While we use 256-bit SSL  encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in  our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information,  not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our  offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for  example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted  access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store  personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="6"></a>The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We  request information from the user on our secure order form. A user must provide  contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial  information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is  used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. We may store this  information securely on our server. We will share your personal information  with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties. If we have trouble  processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. This  information is only shared with other companies who work on behalf of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mercola.com/">Mercola.com</a>&nbsp;to provide a product or service to you.  Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use  the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is  necessary to assist us. We may also use this information to inform you of  additional goods and services about which you might be interested or to  customize your experience and use of the Website.</p>
<p>We may ask you for  personally-identifying information in connection with a promotion or survey.  Any email you receive from us, or third parties authorized by you to send  email, will contain additional opt-out or unsubscribe options in the email with  instructions on how to unsubscribe from receiving future emails.</p>
<p>If you want to send an item  to your friend, like a gift card, we will ask for your friend's first name,  last name, and email address. We will only use this information to complete  your order and send the item to your friend.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mercola.com/">Mercola.com</a> stores this  information for the sole purpose of processing this order and tracking the  success of your order. Your friend may contact us at&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx">https://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx</a>&nbsp;to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>We may automatically gather  general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP  addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services  purchased, transactions completed, etc. To do this, we use action tags and  cookies provided by our site analytics and marketing partners. Although these  partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we authorize  how that data may and may not be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="7"></a>Children Under 13</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect  or use personal information from children under 13. We have no way of  distinguishing the age of individuals who address our website, and so we carry  out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has  provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian should contact us  to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities. If we learn  that we have received personal information from an individual under the age of  13, we will delete the information.</p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="8"></a>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard website  servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses,  browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform  type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the  site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic  information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to other  personally identifiable information.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>

These technologies are  used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users' movements  around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a  whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these  companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
