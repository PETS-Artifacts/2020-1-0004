	<h1 style="text-align:center;">We All Need Privacy. Here’s Our Commitment To Yours</h1>

	<h2>The Skinny on Our Privacy Policy</h2>

	<p>For those who want the short and relevant answer, we will always, <span class="caps">ALWAYS</span>, respect your privacy, your email address, and the information you give us. We’re not going to sell it, trade it, or abuse any information you submit to us. Here are answers to some common questions you might have regarding this subject.</p>

	<h2>How’s my information going to be used?</h2>

	<p>When you sign up for our Products or Services, you’ll begin receiving relevant information about Mindvalley, invites to our online events, as well as information about programs or products in relevant fields like personal growth, education, and peak performance.</p>

	<h2>How do I to stop receiving emails from you in the future?</h2>

	<p>If you wish to stop receiving emails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time using the link provided at the bottom of all our emails. If after this step you still receive emails from us, there may have been a technical error. Please email our Customer Happiness Manager at <a href="mailto:support@mindvalley.com">support@mindvalley.com</a>, or send one from our support page <a href="https://support.mindvalleyacademy.com/">here</a>. We’ll help you out <span class="caps">ASAP</span>.</p>

	<h2>Who’s going to get my information?</h2>

	<p>Your information’s safe with us. So don’t worry about getting spam emails about Viagra or debt consolidation. We’ll never give out your email address or any of the information you submit on this site to anyone else.</p>

	<h2>What if I email you guys?</h2>

	<p>Your emails are confidential, we won’t share your email, data, or email address. Cool? It’s just between you and us.</p>

	<h2>Do you guys use cookies?</h2>

	<p>Yup, but our cookies don’t contain any personal information. We use them to help you make using our website easier, such as:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>To remember your country and language preferences</li>
		<li>To deliver information that matches your interests</li>
		<li>To help us understand our audience and traffic patterns</li>
		<li>To let you automatically log into programs and parts of our site that require membership</li>
		<li>To manage and present site info displayed on our website that will be specific to you</li>
	</ol>

	<p>We also use Web Beacons to collect non-personal data on how you use our site, such as how long did you visit our page, what web browser you’re using, what’s your operating system, and who’s your Internet service provider. In addition we also use Google Analytics data and the DoubleClick cookie to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits to our website. This data is collected from thousands of site visits and analyzed as a whole. This helps us build a better website to match our visitors’ needs.</p>

	<p>Web Beacons: We may also place small “tracker gifs” or “beacons” on many of the pages on our website, in online advertising with third parties, and in our emails.

This information is collected about thousands of site visits and analyzed as a whole. This information is useful in, for example, tracking the performance of our online advertising such as online banner ads and to determine where to place future advertising on other websites.</p>
