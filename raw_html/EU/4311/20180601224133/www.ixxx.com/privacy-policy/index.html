    <h4>B. Other technical information provided by you, your browser or your device.</h4>

    <p>
        When you visit and interact with our site, your browser or device automatically transmits certain technical information to our website. Such information enables us to know e.g. which browser type you use, what your browser settings are, where you originate from, what your referrer is, etc. With this information we can optimize your user experience by showing the site in your language, optimize rankings, customize the user interface etc. But mainly we use this information for analytical, statistical and research purposes, such as tracking referrals and incoming and outgoing traffic. We consider this data anonymous, since this information does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person.
    </p>

    <h4>C. Active personal data obtained from your interactions with us, such as using specific website features or sending (e-mail) messages.</h4>

    <p>
        We may temporarily collect your personal data when you decide to provide this to us when using one of our website features. For example, you may voluntarily provide us with your e-mail address when reporting malware through our report tool or other data by sending us a (e-mail) message.
    </p>

    <h5>E-mails and other messages /mediums</h5>
    <p>
        The data processed by sending us an e-mail is limited to your e-mail-address and the contents of the message. We will process whatever personal data you included in the message. However, we will only process this data to handle your request or feedback. The period for which we store any personal data in your e-mail depends on the extent of your request and our legal obligation to retain such data to comply with laws and regulations, if any. The same goes for any other messages your send to us directly via other mediums, such as Skype or social media.
    </p>

    <h5>Report tool</h5>
    <p>
        If there is an issue with content on our site, you can notify us by using our Report Tool. The information in a report is limited to technical info about your browser settings and the temporary storage of your IP-address. We will mask this IP-address as soon as possible and the browser info is limited to technical data, which we consider anonymous information, since this information does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person. Any personal (contact) info you voluntarily provide will be temporarily processed by us, depending on the extent of your request and our legal obligation to retain such data to comply with laws and regulations, if any.
    </p>

    <h5>No memberships, subscriptions, accounts, profiles etc.</h5>
    <p>
        We do not provide memberships, subscriptions, accounts, profiles or any other means that lead to an agreement between you and us apart from your use of the website. We do not collect your personal data for such purposes. In the event that you come across a feature on this site that requests your personal data for such a purpose, for example a registration request, chat session, membership form or discussion board, you should be aware that this is a request originating from a third party, not from us. We cannot be held responsible for any use of your personal data by a third party that is not part of our services, so please be aware.
