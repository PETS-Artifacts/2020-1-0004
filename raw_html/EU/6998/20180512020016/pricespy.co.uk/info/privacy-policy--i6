<p>In order to give you the world’s best price and product comparison site we need to handle personal data. In our privacy policy we explain what information we collect from our users, how we handle it, and what we do to protect the integrity of our users.</p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies to the handling of personal data that takes place within the framework of PriceSpy, that is, when you use the service PriceSpy at <a href="http://www.pricespy.co.uk">www.pricespy.co.uk</a> and in related digital applications (<strong>&quot;the Services&quot;</strong>). The service is provided by PriceSpy Ltd, with company number 08513484 (<strong>&quot;PriceSpy&quot;</strong>, <strong>&quot;we&quot;</strong> or <strong>&quot;us&quot;</strong>).</p>
<h2 id="key-concepts">Key concepts</h2>
<p><strong>Personal data</strong> means information which can directly or indirectly be linked to a living natural person. Examples of personal data include name, address, phone number, and email address. Under certain circumstances, information about IP addresses and your user behaviour when using the Services may also constitute personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Processing</strong> of personal data covers all use of personal data, such as collection, exchange and storage.</p>
<p><strong>Controller of personal data</strong> means the party which, alone or together with another party, decides on the purposes and means for the processing of the personal data and who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the processing takes place in accordance with applicable personal data legislation.</p>
<h2 id="what-information-we-collect">What information we collect</h2>
<p>To give you an overview of how the processing of data is carried out, we have divided the personal data into two categories based on how it is collected.</p>
<p><em>a) Data that you give us yourself</em></p>
<p>When you use and carry out activities within the framework of the Services, you actively provide information about yourself. This information includes for example name, address, phone number, and email address. Personal data in this category are such that you give to us by completing a web form, sending notices to support, or providing us with feedback through functions created for such purpose.</p>
<p><em>b) Data collected when you use the Services</em></p>
<p>When you use the Services, we collect information about your use. This information includes which Services you use, the websites you visit, and how you behave on websites related to the Services. The information can be divided into the following categories:</p>
<p>i. Technical information about your device and internet connection<br>We use server logs and other tools to register information about your device, connection to our services, and cross-device usage. This information may include operating system, web browser version, IP addresses, cookies, and various unique identifiers.</p>
<p>ii. Information about the use of the Services; user behaviour<br>We register purchases of goods and services within the framework of the Services. We store information about your visits to websites where the Services are provided, and your behaviour when you use the Services. This behaviour may include how you scroll and navigate a website.</p>
<p>iii. Location information<br>When you use the Services, we calculate an approximate geographic location based on the IP address you use. If you have accepted location services on your device, we will regularly collect more detailed information about your geographic location. Location information is used to enable us to provide you with content and advertisements that is relevant to you based on your geographic location. The information may also be used to develop new products and services to provide you with customised content, such as articles and advertising relevant to you. If you no longer want us to be able to collect detailed information about your geographic location, you can at any time disable location services on your phone or device. In such cases, we will only calculate an approximate geographic location based on your IP address.</p>
<p>iv. Cookies and other technologies that store data locally on your device<br>When you visit websites where the Services are provided, we – either directly or through third parties – use various technologies to recognise and learn about you as a user. For more information about this type of technology, see below under &quot;Use of cookies and other technology&quot;.</p>
<p><em>c) Data from other sources</em></p>

This information enables us to provide your with more relevant advertisements and content in the future.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-process-and-share-your-information">Why we process and share your information</h2>
