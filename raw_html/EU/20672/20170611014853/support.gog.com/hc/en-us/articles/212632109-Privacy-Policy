<h3>3. PROTECTING CHILDREN</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>3.1 We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. Legally, children below 13 cannot have a GOG account (but their parents/guardians are welcome to sign up themselves) and we do not and will not knowingly collect personal information from any child under the age of 13 without consent from their parent or guardian. If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned about the transfer of personal information about your child, please contact <a href="mailto:legal@gog.com">legal@gog.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>Children below 13 cannot have GOG accounts without parental/guardian involvement and we cannot collect knowingly personal information about them – this is actually a legal requirement.</p>

<h3>4. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>4.1 When you register a GOG account with us, you will need to provide us: (a) your username; (b) your email address and (c) a password (which is encrypted so that we don’t have access to it). In your GOG account settings you can also set your date of birth and your geographical location. This information will be protected by your GOG account password. You are responsible for keeping it safe - please don't share it with anyone.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>To register a GOG account, we will ask you for and collect some basic personal information, including username and email. Keep your GOG account password safe.</p>

<ul>
<li>(a) Technical details about devices which you use to access GOG services, including: Internet and/or network connection (including your IP address); mobile device identifiers; your operating system, browser type or other software; your hardware details; or other technical details provided by your web browser.

</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>We may also collect additional information when you use other GOG services. If GOG services crash, we might ask you to send us crash logs/bug reports.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>4.3 A quick word about bug reports and crash logs: GOG software will generate bug or crash reports regarding GOG services – these reports will not mention your personal information. You can decide whether to submit these reports to GOG.com automatically. If you manually submit bug or crash reports to us, or if we contact you asking for feedback regarding crash or bug reports, then we may store them alongside your personal information.</p>

By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h3>8. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>We will use the above information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) To enable GOG.com functionality that helps you and your friends keep updated about what you’re doing within GOG services, e.g. notifying you and your GOG.com friends about who is playing what games.</li>
<li>(b) To ensure that GOG services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or other device from which you access GOG services.</li>
<li>(c) To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us and which we feel may interest you - in particular, we may send you newsletters or emails about GOG services (of course, it’s optional).</li>
<li>(d) To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us.</li>
<li>(e) To allow you to participate in interactive features of GOG services when you choose to do so.</li>
<li>(f) To notify you about changes to GOG services.</li>
<li>(g) To improve or modify GOG services, for example based on which games you like more and how you play them.</li>
<li>(h) To calculate conversion rates and other elements of GOG.com performance.</li>
<li>(i) In connection with the services of our Partners, such as payment processors, located in and outside the European Union, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>We will use your information to run GOG and keep improving it as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails). Sometimes we may have to share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types in order to run GOG services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>We might share some aggregated and general non-personal data on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region) with third party partners who work with us to provide GOG services to you (for example, with games developers/publishers selling games on GOG.com or with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend GOG services or to help them to improve their products, which you have bought. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run GOG.com.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human"> </div>
</div>
<h3>HOW YOU USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>Please remember that any communications you have via GOG services (e.g. via private messages, chat or the GOG forums or via multiplayer games) may reveal your screen name, other details about you and the content of any communications by you with other users. Also, any information you post publicly using GOG services (e.g. your public profile) will be publicly available to GOG users and others. We are not responsible for your use of otherwise private personal information, which you make available via GOG services, or the activities of other users or other third parties to whom you give or make available your information.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>When you're using GOG services you can choose to share your own personal information with others (e.g. in chat) but it's your responsibility.</p>

<h3>9. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND EXTERNAL SERVICES</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.1 GOG services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties (e.g. to games developers whose games are on GOG.com). In addition, third parties (e.g. games developers/publishers) may also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. your email address or name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. This may include saving information to your GOG profile in relation to their games (such as, for example, saving game progress). Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>You may find third party links in GOG, or we might have to direct you to third parties (e.g. publishers) so that you can get access to additional functionalities. They may collect information from you under their own privacy policies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.2 GOG services may also offer you easy and optional access to GOG-approved partners’ services, e.g. the websites and games provided by our sister company CD PROJEKT RED. In order to do this, we will need to share some of your personal information (e.g. your email address) with them, as long as you agree to it. This personal information will be protected under our partner’s privacy policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>You can use GOG services to access cool stuff from GOG-approved partners. We will need to share some personal information with them (which you control). It is up to you if you want to use your GOG account for this or not.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.3 A quick word about GOG Connect (which you can read more about <a href="/connect">here</a>). In order for us to provide this (optional) feature to you, we will need access to Valve’s service allowing us to retrieve certain data regarding Steam and games available via Steam (“Steam Data”). We will treat the Steam Data consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will only retrieve Steam Data regarding your Steam account as requested by you and we will notify you what if any Steam Data is stored by us. We will not intercept, store or use your Steam password or login. In accordance with Valve’s requirements, Steam Data is provided: (I) "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, VALVE, STEAM GAME PUBLISHERS AND DEVELOPERS, AND THEIR SUPPLIERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

(II) IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE OR ANY SUPPLIER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM ITS <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms">API TERMS OF USE</a> OR YOUR USE OF STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, OR VALVE BRAND &amp; LINKS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH IS INDEPENDENT OF YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND SURVIVES IN THE EVENT SUCH REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM (A) BREACH OF CONTRACT, (B) BREACH OF WARRANTY, (C) NEGLIGENCE, OR (D) ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THE ABOVE, OR YOU HAVE ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM AGAINST VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, AND VALVE BRAND &amp; LINKS.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>For you to use our GOG Connect service we will need to access “Steam Data” (more info opposite). There are some legal rules that Valve requires us to follow.</p>

<h3>12. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>12.1 We may change this Privacy Policy if we think it's necessary, e.g. for legal reasons or to reflect changes in GOG services.

<p>12.3 If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using GOG services. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for GOG services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries.</p>

<h3>3. PROTECTING CHILDREN</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>3.1 We recognise we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children.

If you are a parent or guardian and are concerned about the transfer of personal information about your child, please contact <a href="mailto:legal@gog.com">legal@gog.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">

<h3>4. WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>7.1 The information we collect from you will normally be stored and processed in the European Economic Area but it may also be transferred to, stored and processed at a destination outside the European Economic Area (including the USA). By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>Most of the time, we will store your information in Europe, but sometimes we might store it elsewhere if necessary. We will do our best to keep this information secure.</p>

<h3>8. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>We will use the above information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) To enable GOG.com functionality that helps you and your friends keep updated about what you’re doing within GOG services, e.g. notifying you and your GOG.com friends about who is playing what games.</li>
<li>(b) To ensure that GOG services are presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer or other device from which you access GOG services.</li>
<li>(c) To provide you with information, products or services that you request from us and which we feel may interest you - in particular, we may send you newsletters or emails about GOG services (of course, it’s optional).</li>
<li>(d) To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts between you and us.</li>
<li>(e) To allow you to participate in interactive features of GOG services when you choose to do so.</li>
<li>(f) To notify you about changes to GOG services.</li>
<li>(g) To improve or modify GOG services, for example based on which games you like more and how you play them.</li>
<li>(h) To calculate conversion rates and other elements of GOG.com performance.</li>
<li>(i) In connection with the services of our Partners, such as payment processors, located in and outside the European Union, but only to the extent necessary to provide those services.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>We will use your information to run GOG and keep improving it as well as to communicate with you (e.g. with newsletters or emails). Sometimes we may have to share anonymised, non-personal information like operating system types in order to run GOG services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>We might share some aggregated and general non-personal data on user behaviour (e.g. sales per region) with third party partners who work with us to provide GOG services to you (for example, with games developers/publishers selling games on GOG.com or with payment providers) in order to support, improve or amend GOG services or to help them to improve their products, which you have bought. We may also share non-personal information with data analysis services to help us run GOG.com.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human"> </div>
</div>
<h3>HOW YOU USE YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>Please remember that any communications you have via GOG services (e.g. via private messages, chat or the GOG forums or via multiplayer games) may reveal your screen name, other details about you and the content of any communications by you with other users. Also, any information you post publicly using GOG services (e.g. your public profile) will be publicly available to GOG users and others. We are not responsible for your use of otherwise private personal information, which you make available via GOG services, or the activities of other users or other third parties to whom you give or make available your information.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>When you're using GOG services you can choose to share your own personal information with others (e.g. in chat) but it's your responsibility.</p>

<h3>9. THIRD PARTY INFORMATION COLLECTION AND EXTERNAL SERVICES</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.1 GOG services may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites or services of third parties (e.g. to games developers whose games are on GOG.com). In addition, third parties (e.g. games developers/publishers) may also collect personally identifiable information (e.g. your email address or name) if you want to access additional game services, but they can collect any such information only after you have been informed of it and consented to it. This may include saving information to your GOG profile in relation to their games (such as, for example, saving game progress). Our Privacy Policy does not extend to these external sites or companies, so please refer directly to their privacy policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>You may find third party links in GOG, or we might have to direct you to third parties (e.g. publishers) so that you can get access to additional functionalities. They may collect information from you under their own privacy policies.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.2 GOG services may also offer you easy and optional access to GOG-approved partners’ services, e.g. the websites and games provided by our sister company CD PROJEKT RED. In order to do this, we will need to share some of your personal information (e.g. your email address) with them, as long as you agree to it. This personal information will be protected under our partner’s privacy policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>You can use GOG services to access cool stuff from GOG-approved partners. We will need to share some personal information with them (which you control). It is up to you if you want to use your GOG account for this or not.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>9.3 A quick word about GOG Connect (which you can read more about <a href="/connect">here</a>). In order for us to provide this (optional) feature to you, we will need access to Valve’s service allowing us to retrieve certain data regarding Steam and games available via Steam (“Steam Data”). We will treat the Steam Data consistent with this Privacy Policy. We will only retrieve Steam Data regarding your Steam account as requested by you and we will notify you what if any Steam Data is stored by us. We will not intercept, store or use your Steam password or login. In accordance with Valve’s requirements, Steam Data is provided: (I) "AS IS," "WITH ALL FAULTS" AND "AS AVAILABLE," AND THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO SATISFACTORY QUALITY, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, AND EFFORT IS WITH YOU.

(II) IN NO EVENT WILL VALVE OR ANY SUPPLIER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF, BASED ON, OR RESULTING FROM ITS <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apiterms">API TERMS OF USE</a> OR YOUR USE OF STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, OR VALVE BRAND &amp; LINKS, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES UNDER THIS PARAGRAPH IS INDEPENDENT OF YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY AND SURVIVES IN THE EVENT SUCH REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OR IS OTHERWISE DEEMED UNENFORCEABLE. THESE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS APPLY WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE FROM (A) BREACH OF CONTRACT, (B) BREACH OF WARRANTY, (C) NEGLIGENCE, OR (D) ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION, TO THE EXTENT SUCH EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH ANY PART OF THE ABOVE, OR YOU HAVE ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM AGAINST VALVE OR ITS SUPPLIERS WITH RESPECT TO THE ABOVE, THEN YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USING THE STEAM WEB API, STEAM DATA, AND VALVE BRAND &amp; LINKS.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>For you to use our GOG Connect service we will need to access “Steam Data” (more info opposite). There are some legal rules that Valve requires us to follow.</p>

<h3>12. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>12.1 We may change this Privacy Policy if we think it's necessary, e.g. for legal reasons or to reflect changes in GOG services.

<p>12.3 If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using GOG services.
