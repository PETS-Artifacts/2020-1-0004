<h3>14. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>14.1 We may change this Privacy Policy if we think it's necessary for legal reasons or to reflect changes in GOG services. If so, we will make the changed Privacy Policy available online and (if you have a GOG account) we'll email you to explain the changes. We will also update the “Last Updated” date.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>We might make changes to our Privacy Policy but whenever we do we’ll display the changes online. These usually take effect after 30 days. Feel free to contact us if you have any questions about the changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>14.2 Once we change the Privacy Policy, it will become legally binding on you 30 days after we post it online. During that period, you're welcome to contact us if you have specific questions about the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>Feel free to contact us if you have any questions with regards to the changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
<p>14.3 If you don't agree to those changes (regardless of whether you email us), then unfortunately we must ask you to cease using GOG services. We're sorry we have to say that, but we hope you'll appreciate that for GOG services to work properly we need to have everyone using it under the same rules instead of different people having different rules. That's why we encourage you to get in contact if you have queries.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12 human">
<p>We ask you to agree to changes to this Privacy Policy, otherwise unfortunately we have to ask you to stop using GOG services.</p>
