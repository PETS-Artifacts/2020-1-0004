<b>Our Disclosure of Your Information</b><br/>
The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal course of business as part of our services. <br/><br/>
Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across numerous registered user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. For such purposes, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify Bettingin.com  users personally. <br/><br/>
Site. Although our pages may be coded with robot exclusion headers, others may illegally attempt to automatically collect your email address from the site. If you are involved in a transaction, we have features that may allow other users to view your email address and obtain your contact and other information to help complete the transaction. Further, we may send out notices to you or other users regarding suspicious activity or policy violations on the site. <br/><br/>
Affiliates for Our Operations. We may use third parties ("affiliates") to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the services that we provide to you (e.g., domain name search technology, advertising provisions, and other services) and therefore we may provide some of your information directly to these affiliates. These affiliates are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced service, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the affiliate may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the affiliate, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be up to you. <br/><br/>
Agents and Business Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint venturers that are committed to serving your online needs and providing related services throughout the world. We use an outside credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our affiliates, subsidiaries, and joint venturers follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. Bettingin.com , its affiliates, subsidiaries, joint venturers, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your information with another business entity should we plan to merge with, or be acquired by, that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this terms and conditions with respect to your information. <br/><br/>

In response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, login name history, fraud complaints, and site use history, with or without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, we will not disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to protect our rights or to prevent imminent physical harm, financial loss or to report suspected past, present, or future illegal activity. Further, we can, and you authorize us to, disclose to a third party your information, including your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity. <br/><br/>
