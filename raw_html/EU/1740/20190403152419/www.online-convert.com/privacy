Art. 21 para. 1 DSGVO, so-called “restricted right of objection”). In this case, you must state the grounds for your objection which result from your specific situation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can also object the processing of your personal data for reasons that arise from your specific situation, after they had been processed for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes in accordance with art. 89 para. 1 DSGVO, unless the processing is necessary for performing a task in the public interest (cf. Art. 21 para. 6 DSGVO).</strong></p>
</div>

<p>In the individual sections, we will also point out the right of objection to you separately (e.g. by using the note: “<strong>You have the right of objection</strong>”) if this right exists. There, you will also find further information on how to exercise your right of objection.</p>

            <h2>7. Usage of Google Analytics</h2>

<p>On our website we use Google Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google Inc. („Google“), 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
<p>Google Analytics uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google Analytics may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on a website can be evaluated. The information about the usage of our website (including the IP address of the users) generated by cookies and web beacons are transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This information might be shared by Google with Google’s contract partners.</p>
<p><strong style="text-decoration: underline;">Information</strong> on Google’s existing Privacy Shield certification and other relevant data relating to Google’s processing of data in the scope of using Google services can be found in this data processing declaration in paragraph “<strong>6) Information about Google services</strong>”.</p>

<p>We only use Google Analytics with IP anonymization enabled (“anonymize IP”). This results in the shortening of your IP address by Google within member states of the European Union or other states that are part of the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is transmitted to one of Google’s servers in the USA and shortened there.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we concluded a contract of order processing with Google for the use of Google Analytics (art. 28 DSGVO). Google processes the data on our behalf in order to evaluate your usage of the website, to compile reports about the website activity for us, and to provide us with further services relating to website and internet usage. Google might transfer this information to third parties when required by law or if third parties process this data on Google’s behalf.</p>
<p>By integrating Google Analytics, we pursue the purpose of analyzing the user behavior on our website and being able to react to it. This enables us to continuously improve our offer.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1 lit f) DSGVO. Our legitimate interest for this is the great benefit for our offer that is provided by the functions described above. The statistical evaluation of the user behavior enables us to react and optimize our offers according to the interests of our customers in particular.</p>
<p>Within the scope of order processing, Google is entitled to commission subcontractors. You can find a list of these subcontractors under <a href="https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/" target="_blank">https://privacy.google.com/businesses/subprocessors/</a>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, you can change your cookie preferences (e.g. deleting cookies, blocking cookies, etc.). More information about this can be found under “<strong>5) Cookies</strong>”.</p>
</div>

<p>The processed information is stored for 26 months and will be deleted automatically at the end of this period.</p>

<p>Google AdSense is a Google service that displays Google advertisements from advertisers on third-party websites. By integrating Google AdSense we provide Google with appropriate advertising space o our website.</p>
<p>Google AdSense uses so-called “cookies”, which are text files that are saved on your device and that enabled the website to conduct an analysis of the websites you visited. Google AdSense may also use so-called web beacons (invisible graphics). Via these web beacons, information such as the visitor traffic on the pages of this offer can be evaluated. The information generated by cookies and web beacons about the usage of our website (including your IP address) and the delivery of advertising formats will be transmitted to and stored by a Google server that might be located in the USA or other third countries. This way, Google can reconstruct on which websites the usage of advertising media took place in order to be able to allocate a commission to the website operator.</p>

<p>Through the integration of Google AdSense, we pursue the purpose of being able to offer you interest-based advertisements, and to be able to finance our offer through the successful use of advertising media. For this, we are using the option “contextual-only advertisements” from Google AdSense. This means that Google will broadcast advertisements based on the content of our website and not on the interest profile created by you. Therefore, an analysis of your data for the purpose of profiling does not take place here. However, Google also uses cookies and web beacons in the scope of the “contextual-only advertisements” to prevent abuse, compile statistics, and prevent multiple visits.</p>

<h2>19. Amazon affiliate program</h2>

<p>On our website, we are using the Amazon affiliate program. The Amazon affiliate program is a network for affiliate marketing. Operators of the Amazon affiliate program are Amazon Europe Core S.à.r.l., Amazon EU S.à.r.l, Amazon Services Europe S.à.r.l., and Amazon Media EU S.à.r.l., all four of them located at 5, Rue Plaetis, L-2338 Luxemburg, as well as  Amazon Instant Video Germany GmbH, Domagkstr. 28, 80807 Munich. Amazon Deutschland Services GmbH, Marcel-Breuer-Str. 12, 80807 Munich will act as the data processor on their behalf.</p>
<p>Using the Amazon affiliate program, registered participants can advertise products on their website. For this, various advertising measures such as data, images, texts, links, widgets, link formats, and other linking tools or information can be provided by the affiliate program. The goal of the participation in the Amazon affiliate program is that end users place a “qualified order” at Amazon via advertisement. Participants receive a reimbursement of advertising costs for such an order.</p>
<p>We are registered as a participant in the Amazon affiliate program.</p>
<p>After clicking on an advertisement of the Amazon affiliate program on our website, which will redirect to an offer <strong>on an external website, Amazon sets a cookie</strong> on your device which, among others, contains an ID that allows an association for Amazon. That way, it is possible for Amazon to detect that you took notice of the offer and visited the website via our website. Additionally, a potential purchase of the product can be traced and assigned to our affiliate ID. Amazon can detect your device based on this ID and, e.g., display personalized advertisements to you.</p>
<p>Further information on Amazon’s usage of this data can be found here: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201909010</a></p>
<p>The legal basis for the processing of personal data described here is art. 6 para. 1. lit. f) DSGVO. We have an economic interest in having our results gathered by the Amazon affiliate program, as this is how we finance our offer.</p>
<p>The data will only be stored as long as it is necessary for the provision of this function.</p>
