					<p><b>1.4</b>	We may change these terms on one or more occasions by updating this webpage. The top of the terms will tell you when we last updated them. Changes will take effect on the “last updated” date stated on the top of this webpage. Changes will not operate retroactively. We will try to notify you when we change these terms if we can do so in a commercially reasonable manner. But you should frequently check this webpage to make sure that you are operating under the most current version of the terms. We will consider your continued use of the Website after we post the changes as your acceptance of the changes even if you do not read them. If you do not agree to the changes, your sole remedy is to stop accessing the Website.</p><br/>

We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information we collect and that is why we provide you the ability to opt-out.

					<strong><em>Claim of Infringement Counter-Notification &ndash;</em></strong>

					business days, unless the Complaining Party notifies us that it has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain you, the subscriber, from engaging in
					infringing activity related to the material on Glorious Holding Investment, Ltd.'s system or network.

				<p>
					Please note that when we forward the counter-notification to the Complaining Party, it includes your personal information. By submitting a
