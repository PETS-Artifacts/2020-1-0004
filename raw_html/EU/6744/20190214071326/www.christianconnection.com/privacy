<h2>1. Data Protection</h2>

<p>In addition, you have rights under the Data Protection Legislation. For an overview of your rights under these laws, please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/data-protection/the-data-protection-act">the data protection section on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>

<h3>Other information you provide us with</h3>
<p><strong>2.2</strong> When you create a Profile we will collect Personal Information about you that you put in your Profile. This might include photos, your interests and the type of person you would like to meet, and anything else you say about yourself on your Profile.</p>
<p><strong>2.3</strong> You may change or delete Personal Information provided by you at any time by logging into your account on the Website.</p>
<p><strong>2.4</strong> If you send us a success story about yourself and a partner you have met through Christian Connection, or other testimonial comments, we will collect Personal Information about you that is included in any such submission.</p>

<h3>By your use of The Service</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>IP address of device(s) used;</li>
    <li>browser type;</li>
    <li>operating system and device type;</li>
    <li>approximate location (e.g. London);</li>

<h2>3. Data use within the Website</h2>
<p><strong>3.1</strong> None of the information in clause 2.1 will be given to other people via the Website, except your first name and gender which will appear on your Profile. We will assign you a username which you can use on the Website. Other Members will only know your username and other information should you choose to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>3.2</strong> When you fill in your Profile, the information provided will be available to other users of this Website. The information you provide to us as part of your Profile should exclude anything that could allow you to be specifically identified or contacted outside the Website. Your Profile is a page on Christian Connection which shows your photos and the answers you provide On Registration. You can edit your Profile at any time, and it’s up to you to keep it up to date. Your Profile can be seen only by other Members of Christian Connection, however, we can’t control who registers on Christian Connection and therefore you should be careful about what you choose to share. Your Profile will be promoted alongside your photo to other users through recommendations and search results on the Website, and in email communications, push notifications and SMS recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>3.3</strong> When completing your Profile there are several questions, and some of these are mandatory for you to be able to use the Website, the remainder are discretionary. We do not allow you to add your private email address, surname, address or other contact details into your Profile, so other users will not have access to this information unless you choose to send it to them via the messaging system.  We moderate and remove any such private information from your Profile that we become aware of, but please note that if you include such information in your Profile, we may not always be able to recognise and remove it. You can update your Profile at any time.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> Any person can visit parts of the Website without being a Member. They will be able to see extracts from media articles, success stories and testimonials from others. They will not be able to access the majority of the Website nor see full Profiles.

It is also in our legitimate interest to use your Personal Information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best service we can to you.</em>
  </blockquote></p>

  </blockquote></p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> Internal record keeping and legal compliance. Complaints are investigated as appropriate. The fact of the complaint may be recorded and details stored in case of future complaints against the same Member. See section 6 below for more information.
  <blockquote>
    <strong>What is our legal basis?</strong> <em>It is in our legitimate interest to store your Personal Information in this way to comply with and/or enforce our legal rights and obligations, and to protect the rights of third parties.</em>
  </blockquote></p>
<p><strong>4.7</strong> We may send you information about our events or products, including newsletters and other marketing materials electronically or by post.

<p><strong>4.8</strong> Profiling. We may use your information for customer profiling to ensure that we create and market the most suitable products and services to you.  This may include:
  <ul>
    <li>To promote your Profile to other Members who may be most interested in meeting you</li>
    <li>To identify individuals who would benefit from additional promotion to other Members</li>
    <li>To identify fraudulent or misleading behaviour</li>
    <li>To identify users who may be receptive to a particular promotion or offer; and</li>
    <li>To recommend users to other users based on their attributes and behaviour.</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>What is our legal basis?</strong> <em>It is in our legitimate interest to use your Personal Information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best service we can to you.</em>
  </blockquote></p>
<p><strong>4.9</strong> Data Analytics. We use data about your behaviour and use of the site for the following reasons:
  <ul>
    <li>to identify potential fraud by comparing genuine behaviour with known fraudulent behaviour;</li>
    <li>to help us plan targeted marketing and advertising campaigns, by looking at how particular groups of users are using The Service;</li>
    <li>to help us understand what behaviours are more likely to result in a successful experience (typically finding a partner), so that we can pass on advice to Members, and we can improve the design of The Service to achieve a higher success rate by encouraging the kind of behaviour that is more likely to yield a success;</li>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>What is our legal basis?</strong> <em>Where your Personal Information is completely anonymised, we do not require a legal basis as the information will no longer constitute Personal Information. However, where your Personal Information is not in an anonymous form, it is in our legitimate interest to continually evaluate that Personal Information to ensure that the products and services we provide are relevant to the market and provide the very best service we can to you.</em>
  </blockquote></p>

<h2>5. Passing on Information about you</h2>
<p><strong>5.1</strong> Christian Connection uses various third party providers to help provide The Service to you.  These third parties process your Personal Information on our behalf for the purposes of site administration, payments, development and back-up.
  <blockquote>
    <strong>What is our legal basis?</strong> <em>It is in our legitimate interest to share your Personal Information in such a way to ensure that we provide the very best service we can to you. Where we share your sensitive Personal Information (eg religious or political views, or health or sexuality information), we shall be relying on your consent to do so which you provide if you choose to submit such information.</em>
  </blockquote></p>

<p><strong>5.6</strong> We are a member of the <a href="http://www.onlinedatingassociation.org.uk">Online Dating Association</a> (ODA). The ODA helps to ensure the safety, and protect the vital interests, of those who use dating sites in the UK. In helping to ensure the safety of users, if a user's actions or behaviour on Christian Connection cause us to become aware of or reasonably suspect that the user may be guilty of, or may commit, a serious offence then we may (at our sole discretion) share information about such user (which may include sensitive personal data) and the serious offence with the ODA who may in turn share this information with other members of the ODA. Where we do share such user's information we will only disclose such information as is strictly necessary for the purpose of the ODA and its members reviewing the serious offence and whether or not it would be appropriate to block such users them from any sites. In certain circumstances we may disclose information about a user in relation to a serious offence to the police or users at risk where we believe it is in the vital interests of those users. In this section the term "serious offence" includes, but is not limited to: racist, sexist or discriminatory, physically or sexually threatening actions or comments; actually or attempting to defraud other users; actions such as stalking or harassment which could cause a user serious distress; and repeated offences which in isolation are not considered serious but collectively display a pattern of behaviour which may cause other users harm or serious distress.
