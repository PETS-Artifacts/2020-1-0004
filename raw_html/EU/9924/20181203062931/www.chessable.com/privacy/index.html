			<p>You may choose not to provide us with personal data and you may turn off cookies in your browser by changing its settings. If you make these decisions, you may continue to browse the pages of chessable.com. However, we will not be able to provide you with the Chessable service.</p>
			<p>You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>
			<p>You have the right to access information we hold about you, together with an explanation of the categories of data being processed, the purposes of such processing, and the categories of third parties to whom the data may be disclosed. You can also require us to provide you details of the period for which the data will be stored (or the criteria used to determine that period) and information about your other rights regarding our use of your data. We will provide you with the information within one month of your request, unless doing so would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. That would include, for example, another person’s confidentiality or intellectual property rights. We’ll tell you if we can’t meet your request for that reason.  If you wish to exercise this right, please send a request to <a href="mailto:hello@chessable.com">hello@chessable.com</a>.</p>
			<p>You also have the following rights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The right to require us to rectify any inaccurate personal data concerning you.</li>
				
				<li>The right to be ‘forgotten’ by us and have us erase any personal data we hold about you, if it is no longer necessary for us to hold the data for purposes of your use of the Service.</li>
				
				<li>The right to object to us using your data for the purposes of profiling you or making automated decisions about you. We may use your data to determine whether we should let you know information about the Service which might be relevant to you. Otherwise, the only circumstances in which we will do this is to provide you with the Chessable service.</li>
				
				<li>The right to ask us to port your data to another service (if technically feasible) or to provide you with a copy of data we hold about you in a structured, commonly used machine-readable format so that you can provide it to them. We will do so to the extent that we are required to under applicable laws, but not to the extent that this involves disclosing data about any other individual.</li>
				
				<li>You can also exercise these rights at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:hello@chessable.com">hello@chessable.com</a>. To the extent that it does not involve disproportionate effort on our part, if you exercise any of the above rights we will tell any third parties to whom we have passed your data.</li>				
				
			</ul>
			<p>Additionally, you have the right to lodge a complaint regarding our use of your data. You should address any complaint to the Information Commissioner’s Office, either by calling their helpline on 0303 123 1113 or as directed on their website at <a href="https://www.ico.org.uk" target="_blank">www.ico.org.uk</a>.</p>
