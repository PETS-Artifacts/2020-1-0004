This is a new initiative and it is not yet possible to &#x27;port&#x27; data directly between providers in the betting and gaming industry.  However, if you wish to exercise this right, you should submit your request <!-- /react-text --><a href="mailto:SAR@skybettingandgaming.com" data-reactid="664">here</a><!-- react-text: 665 -->, and we will provide you with the following information as a CSV file:  <!-- /react-text --></p><ul data-reactid="666"><li data-reactid="667">the personal and contact details held in your online account</li><li data-reactid="668">your betting and gaming history</li><li data-reactid="669">A list of payments made and funds withdrawn</li></ul><p data-reactid="670">Before responding to your request, we will ask you to provide valid proof of identity, and we will provide our response within one month of receiving it.</p><p data-reactid="671"><!-- react-text: 672 -->In future, it may become possible to transfer (or &#x27;port&#x27;) data directly between organisations.  In the meanwhile, if you would like to take your SBG data <!-- /react-text --><strong data-reactid="673">to another provider</strong><!-- react-text: 674 --> you should first check that your chosen provider is able to upload data from a CSV file before making your request as above and passing the file to the provider yourself.  If you would like to &#x27;port&#x27; your data <!-- /react-text --><strong data-reactid="675">into SBG from another provider</strong><!-- react-text: 676 -->, you should first contact <!-- /react-text --><a href="mailto:SAR@skybettingandgaming.com" data-reactid="677">SAR@skybettingandgaming.com</a><!-- react-text: 678 --> to see whether we can accommodate your request.
