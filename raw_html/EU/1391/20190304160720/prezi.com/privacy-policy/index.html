(“Prezi,” “us,” or “we”) respects the privacy and personal
        information of the members of the Prezi community. This privacy policy
        applies to all of the services offered by Prezi, Inc., including the
        Prezi website, Prezi Desktop software, and mobile device software, but
        excludes services that have separate privacy policies that do not
        incorporate this privacy policy.</p><p>Collectively, the services covered by this privacy policy are referred
        to herein as the “<strong>Services</strong>.” This privacy policy,
        explains what information we collect from you, how we use that
        information, how you can review or change the personal information you
        provided to us, when this policy is effective, how we may change this
        policy, and the steps we take to ensure that your personal information
        is protected. We share your personal information only with your consent
        or as described in this policy.</p><p>In specific cases, we use the term “<strong>Designated Countries</strong>”
        to refer to countries in the European Union (EU), European Economic Area
        (EEA), and Switzerland.</p><h4> Data Controller and Contracting Parties</h4><p> Prezi Inc. will be the controller of your personal information
        provided to, or collected by or for, or processed in connection with,
        our Services. The <a href="https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of
          Use</a>, together with the other policies and agreements listed
        therein, are between you and Prezi Inc. In the case of content
        information you provide (see “Content Information” section below) you
        control such information, you should be solely liable for it and it is
        outside our control.</p><p>As a registered user or site visitor, the collection, use and sharing
        of your personal data is subject to this Privacy Policy (which includes
        our <a href="https://prezi.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie Policy</a> and
        other documents referenced in this Privacy Policy) and updates.</p><h4> Changes to the policy</h4><p> This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time, and if we make
        material changes to it, we will provide notice through the Services, or
        by other appropriate means.</p><p>Your continued use of our Services after a revised privacy policy is

        features, such as searching and viewing public presentations. If you do
        choose to create an account and become a member, you must provide us
        with some personal data so that we can provide our services to you
        including your name, email address and/or phone number, occupation,
        title and a password.</p><h4> Payment Information</h4><p> In order to gain access to specific premium features within our
        Services, you must provide us with payment information, including your
        credit or debit card number, card expiration date, CVV code, and billing
        address.</p><h4> Support Information</h4><p> The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose
        to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing.&nbsp;
        For example, if you designate yourself as a technical contact, open a
        support ticket, speak to one of our representatives directly or
        otherwise engage with our support team, you will be asked to provide
        contact information, a summary of the problem you are experiencing, and
        any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be
        helpful in resolving the issue.</p><h4> Survey Information</h4><p> From time to time, we may ask our registered users or visitors to
        participate in surveys. These surveys are optional. If you choose to
        participate, any information you provide to us, including personal
        information, will be linked with your account in our system. If you
        would not like your information to be used in this way, you have the
        option to not participate in surveys or, if you do participate, to
        provide us only with information you consent to our use of in accordance
        with this Privacy Policy.</p><h4> Content Information (User Content)</h4><p> Parts of our Services allow users to upload user content, including
        presentations, messages, comments, images, and other materials. If you
        choose to upload personal information through these means in a manner
        that makes it visible to the public, we will consider that information
        public and will not limit its use or disclosure in the manner described
        in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>We do not associate content information that is stored in your
        presentations, infographics or other free-form content inputs, such as
        comments, with personal information about you or others. Information in
        your presentations and infographics belongs to you, and you are
        responsible for it, as well as for making sure that your content
        complies with our <a href="https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/">Terms of
          Service</a>. Our employees do not access private content unless
        required to for security or maintenance, or for support reasons, or with
        your consent.</p><p>Occasionally to conduct research for the purposes of better understanding
       user behavior and in order to create improved experiences and new functionality,
       strictly on an anonymous basis, we may view access your content. The generated
       from this analysis is stored in a manner which could not be linked to the owner’s
       content and cannot be used to identify an individual.</p><p>If your content is made public, anyone (including us) may view its
        contents and potentially make other uses of it. If you have included
        private or sensitive information in your public presentation, such as
        email addresses, that information may be indexed by search engines or
        used by third parties. If your user content is shared privately, those
        you have shared it with may use it in a manner inconsistent with our
        Terms of Use, and/or inconsistent with your wishes, including disclosing
        it publicly. </p><h3><a id="mozTocId620509" class="mozTocH3"></a> Information You Share
        About Others</h3><h4> Contact Information</h4><p> Some components of the Services allow you and others to share user
        content and send personal messages with other registered users and
        non-registered users. To use this feature, you must provide us with
        personal information about others including an email address for each
        recipient. For example, when collaborating on a presentation you may
        want feedback from other team members or non-team members and you can do
        so by adding those members as collaborators.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId845553" class="mozTocH3"></a> Additional Information We
        Receive About You</h3><h4> Use of the Services</h4><p> We receive information when you view content on or otherwise interact
        with the Services, even if you are a visitor. For example, when you
        visit our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email
        notifications, or visit a third-party service that includes content from
        our Services, we may receive information about you, or combine such
        information with other personal information. This service usage
        information includes data such as your IP address, browser type,
        operating system, the referring web page, pages visited within our
        Services, location, your mobile carrier, device information (including
        device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie information.</p><h4> Services you link to your account</h4><p> We receive information about you when you or your administrator
        integrate or link a third-party service with our Services, including
        information from the third party who provides the linked service. For
        example, if you create an account or log into the Services using your
        Google credentials, we receive your name and email address as permitted
        by your Google profile settings in order to authenticate you. We also
        provide options within the Services that enable you to link to services
        such as Slack and Salesforce, so you can receive real time notifications
        and integrate content within those platforms. To learn more about these
        third parties’ privacy practices, please consult their privacy policies.</p><h4> Cookies, Web Beacons and Other Similar Technologies</h4><p> A cookie is a small amount of information that a website you visit
        stores on your computer or device. Like many websites, we, our service
        providers, linked services, and third party content that appears on our
        Services may use cookies to collect additional website usage data and to
        operate our Services. Cookies are not required for many parts of our
        Services such as viewing public content. You can control at any time
        what cookies you allow through your browser settings and other tools.
        However, some of our Services may not function properly if you disable
        cookies. When your browser or device allows it, we use both session
        cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact
        with our Services, and to monitor aggregate usage patterns. You can read
        further information about how we use cookies as described in our <a href="https://prezi.com/cookie-policy/">Cookie
          Policy</a>.</p><p>The Services, our service providers, linked services, and third party
        content that appears on our Services may use other tracking tools,
        including so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “web bugs,” “clear
        GIFs,” etc. (collectively “Web Beacons”) to collect information about
        your activities on the Services. These are small electronic images
        embedded in web content and email messages and are ordinarily not
        visible to users. Like cookies, Web Beacons enable us and our service
        providers to track pages and content accessed and viewed by users. Also,
        when we send HTML-formatted (as opposed to plain text) emails to you,
        Web Beacons may be embedded in such emails to allow us to monitor
        readership levels so that we can identify aggregate trends and
        individual usage to provide our audiences with more relevant content or
        offers. Web Beacons in emails may recognize activities such as when an
        email was opened, how many times an email was forwarded, which links in
        the email were clicked, etc. Web Beacons cannot be declined when
        delivered via a regular web page. However, Web Beacons can be refused
        when delivered via email. If you do not wish to receive Web Beacons via
        email, you will need to disable HTML images or refuse HTML (select Text
        only) emails via your email software </p><p>Subject to your settings, if you view or click on an advertisement that
        we have placed on our Services, or the site of a third party, the ad
        provider will learn that someone visited the page that displayed the ad,
        may receive information about you such as your IP address, and may
        through that information or the use of other mechanisms such as cookies
        be able to personally identify you. Our advertising partners may share
        information they collect in connection with our advertising, including
        personal information, with us. </p><h4> Our Partners and Service Providers</h4><p>Prezi relies on a number of other companies, agents, and/or contractors
        to perform services on our behalf and to assist us in operating and
        providing the Services to you. For example, we may engage such service
        providers to provide marketing, communications, website hosting,
        infrastructure and IT services, to personalize and optimize the
        Services, provide customer service, collect debts, and analyze and
        enhance data. In the course of providing such services to us, these
        companies may obtain information about you, including personal
        information, and that information will be shared with us. We do not
        authorize these companies to use or disclose your personal information
        except in connection with providing the services we request from them.</p><p>One of our service providers is Google Analytics, which collects
        information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they
        visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to
        this site. To learn more about how Google Analytics collects and uses
        your data when you use the Service, and how you can control the
        information sent to Google Analytics, please review <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners</a>.
      </p><h4> Do Not Track Signals</h4><p> At this time, the Services do not respond to “do not track” signals
        sent from web browsers.</p><h4> Other</h4>
      Our Services are dynamic, and we often introduce new features, which may
      require the collection of new information. If we collect materially
      different personal information or materially change how we use your data,
      we will notify you and may also modify this Privacy Policy.
      <h3><a id="mozTocId923230" class="mozTocH3"></a> Information We Do Not
        Collect</h3><p> We do not intentionally collect information from registered users or
        visitors under the age of 13. We do not intentionally collect sensitive
        personal information, such as social security numbers, genetic data,
        health information, or religious information. Although we do not request

        that you might store this kind of information in your account, such as
        in a presentation and/or infographic. If you store any sensitive
        personal information on our servers, you are consenting to our storage,
        processing and use of that information in accordance with this privacy
        policy.</p></div><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 terms-section"><h2><a id="mozTocId65348" class="mozTocH2"></a> How We Use Your
        Information</h2><p> How we use the information we collect depends in part on which
        Services you use, how you use them, and any preferences you have
        communicated to us.&nbsp; Below are the specific purposes for which we
        use the information we collect about you.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId942977" class="mozTocH3"></a> To Provide the Services</h3><p> We use the information we collect including account, payment, contact,
        and support information to provide the Services to you, including to
        process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide
        customer support, and operate and maintain the Services.</p><p>We also use service usage information to operate our services and
        ensure their secure, reliable, and robust performance. For example, we
        use the information to protect the security of accounts and to determine
        what content is popular on our services. </p><h3><a id="mozTocId362549" class="mozTocH3"></a> For Developing Services
        and Research</h3><p> We use the information we collect including account, service usage and
        survey information to conduct research and development for the further
        development of our Services in order to provide the Services to you and
        others.</p><p>We use collective learnings about how people use our Services and
        feedback provided directly to us to troubleshoot and to identify trends,
        usage, activity patterns and areas for integration and improvement of
        the Services. In some cases, we apply these learnings across our
        Services to improve and develop similar features or to better integrate
        the services you use. We also test and analyze certain new features with
        some users before rolling the feature out to all users. </p><h4> Aggregate Insights</h4><p> We may also use the information we collect to produce and share
        aggregated insights that do not identify you. For example, we may choose
        to publish statistics regarding how many members live in the U.S. versus
        how many live in Europe. If you complete a survey that asks for
        employment information, we may publish statistics regarding which
        professions are most likely to use or not use our Services.</p><h4> Personalized Experiences</h4><p> Within our Services, we include tailored features that personalize
        your experience, enhance your productivity, and improve your ability to
        collaborate effectively with others by automatically analyzing your
        activities and those of your team to provide better content,
        notifications, and recommendations that are most relevant for you and
        your team. For example, we may use your email domain to infer your
        affiliation with a particular organization or industry to personalize
        the content and experience you receive on our websites and/or
        communications. Where you use multiple Services (e.g., Prezi Desktop,
        Prezi on the web or mobile device), we combine information about you and
        your activities to provide an integrated experience, such as to allow
        you to find information from one Service while searching from another or
        to present relevant information as you travel across our websites.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId451302" class="mozTocH3"></a> To Communicate with you</h3><h4> Services Communications</h4><p> We use the information we collect, including account and contact
        information to send communications via email, phone and within the
        Services, including confirming your purchases, reminding you of
        subscription expirations, responding to your comments, questions and
        requests, providing customer support, and sending you technical notices,
        updates, security alerts, and administrative messages.&nbsp; We send you
        email notifications when you or others interact with you on the
        Services, for example, when you are @mentioned on a comment. We also
        provide tailored communications based on your activity and interactions
        with us.&nbsp; For example, certain actions you take in the Services may
        automatically trigger a feature or third-party app suggestion within the
        Services that would make that task easier.&nbsp; We also send you
        communications as you onboard to a particular Service to help you become
        more proficient in using that Service.&nbsp; These communications are
        part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them.&nbsp;
        If an opt out is available, you will find that option within the
        communication itself or in your account settings.</p><h4> Marketing</h4><p> We use the information we collect, including account, contact, service
        usage and survey information to send you information or materials via
        email about products, offers, and news we think might interest you. In
        specific cases where we have your consent and you have provided us
        additional contact information, we may contact you through other
        channels including telephone. These communications are aimed at driving
        engagement and maximizing what you get out of the Services, including
        information about new features, survey requests, newsletters, and events
        we think may be of interest to you.&nbsp; We also communicate with you
        about new product offers, promotions and contests of Prezi Inc. or its
        licensees or selected commercial partners. You can control whether you
        receive these communications as described below under "Your Choices
        &amp; Obligations" section.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId440312" class="mozTocH3"></a> For Customer Support</h3><p> We use the information we collect, including service usage information
        (which can include your communications) to investigate, respond to and
        resolve complaints and Service issues (e.g., bugs).</p><h3><a id="mozTocId273898" class="mozTocH3"></a> For Advertising</h3><p> We use the information we collect, including account and contact
        information to target ads to registered users, visitors and others
        through a variety of advertising partners. In some cases we also use
        information including service usage information, and information from
        web beacons, pixels, and cookies, and device identifiers that we collect
        as mentioned above to better understand how to promote and advertise our
        Services to you.</p><p>For example, we use Facebook Custom Audiences to promote specific
        Services on Facebook’s ad platform. We will only use these advertising
        partners to promote our Services. We do not promote other products or
        services that are not related to Prezi Inc. </p><h3><a id="mozTocId273123" class="mozTocH3"></a> For Safety and Security</h3><p> We use the information we collect, including account, payment and
        service usage information (including your communications) to verify
        accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and
        to identify violations of Service policies including our <a href="https://prezi.com/terms-of-use/">Terms
          of Service</a> or this Privacy Policy and/or attempts to harm our
        Members or Visitors.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId177120" class="mozTocH3"></a> To Protect Legitimate
        Interests and Legal Rights</h3><p> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect
        our legal rights, legitimate interests and those of others, we may use
        or disclose information about you in connection with legal claims,
        compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and in connection with the
        acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId872854" class="mozTocH3"></a> With Your Consent</h3><p> We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so
        for a specific purpose not listed above.&nbsp; For example, we may
        publish testimonials or featured customer stories to promote the
        Services, with your permission.</p></div><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 terms-section"><h2><a id="mozTocId53575" class="mozTocH2"></a> How We Share Information</h2><p> We make collaboration tools, and we want them to work well for you. We

        and contact information, and grant permission to others to see, share,
        edit, copy and download that content based on settings you or your
        administrator (if applicable) select.&nbsp; Some of the collaboration
        features of the Services display some or all of your profile information
        to other Service users when you share or interact with specific content.
        You can confirm whether certain Service properties are publicly visible
        from within the Services or by contacting the relevant administrator.</p><h4> Sharing of Public Content</h4><p> We enable the sharing of user content on our Services. If your content
        is public-facing, third parties may access and use it. We do not sell
        that content; it is yours. However, we do allow third parties, such as
        search engines (e.g., Google), archives, and other members of the public
        to access and compile public-facing information.</p><h4> Managed accounts and administrators</h4><p> If you register for or access the Services using an account that is
        associated with a team or organization, information about you including
        your account, service usage, and user content will be accessible to that

        information with other registered users within the same organization.</p><p>In the case of team accounts, depending on the contractual agreement,
        we may be considered as a processor of the personal information and the
        organization and it’s administrator would be the controller of such
        data. </p><h4> Community Forums</h4><p> Our websites offer publicly accessible blogs, and forums. You should
        be aware that any information you provide on these websites - including

        standard contractual data protection clauses, binding corporate rules
        for transfers to data processors, or other appropriate legal mechanisms
        to safeguard the transfer.</p><p></p><p> Countries where we process data may have laws which are different, and
        potentially not as protective, as the laws of your own country.</p></div><div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 terms-section"><h2><a id="mozTocId944820" class="mozTocH2"></a> Other Important
        Information</h2><h3><a id="mozTocId997833" class="mozTocH3"></a> Our Policy Towards
        Children</h3><p> The Services are for a general audience, and do not direct any
        content, products, or Services at children under 13 years of age. We
        understand and are committed to respecting the sensitive nature of
        children’s privacy online. If you are a user between the ages of 13 and
        18, you may only use Prezi through an account established by a parent or
        guardian, with that parent or guardian’s permission – provided that in
        your jurisdiction there is no requirement for you or your parent to
        provide any consent to Prezi for a minor’s use beyond what is already
        provided in Prezi’s Terms of Use and Privacy policy. By way of example,
        in some Designated Countries users as old as 16 may be required to have
        their parent or guardian submit a specific consent to Prezi, and in
        those countries users under 16 years of age may not use Prezi.</p><h3><a id="mozTocId853867" class="mozTocH3"></a> Legal bases for
        processing (for Designated Countries) </h3><p> If you are a member or visitor in the Designated Countries, we collect
        and process information about you only where we have legal bases for
        doing so under applicable EU laws. The primary legal basis for this is
        always your consent given when you sign up to our Services.&nbsp; The
        legal bases depend on the Services you use and how you use them. This
        means we collect and use your information only where:</p><ul><li>We need it to provide you the Services, including to operate the
          Services, provide customer support and personalized features and to
          protect the safety and security of the Services;</li><li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your
          data protection interests), such as for research and development, to
          market and promote the Services and to protect our legal rights and
          legitimate interests or those of third parties;</li><li> You give us consent to do so for a specific purpose; or</li><li> We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li></ul><p> If you have consented to our use of information about you for a
        specific purpose, you have the right to change your mind at any time,
        but this will not affect any processing that has already taken
        place.&nbsp; Where we are using your information because we or a third
        party (e.g. your employer) have a legitimate interest to do so, you have
        the right to object to that use though, in some cases, this may mean no
        longer using the Services.</p><p>If you have any questions about the lawful bases upon which we collect
        and use your personal data <a href="https://prez.is/tr6a5yo/">click
