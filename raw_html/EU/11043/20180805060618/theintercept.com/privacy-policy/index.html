<strong><em>4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES ON THE SERVICES</em></strong><br />

By default, we endeavor to treat all visitors as if they have activated “Do Not Track,” a setting in web browsers that communicates to all servers that the visitor does not want information about them tracked. However, we and our Service Providers may collect and store your information in log files as well as through the use of cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (<strong>“Tracking Technologies”</strong>). We do not affirmatively monitor or take action with respect to “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms that contradict your consent. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com. The Tracking Technologies on our Services may include, without limitation:<br />

<strong>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”).</strong> Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used to provide information about how our visitors use our Services and how they interact with our email newsletters and with our stories that appear on other websites.<br />
<br />
<strong>Embedded Scripts.</strong> An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services.
