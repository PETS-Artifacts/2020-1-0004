<p class="intercom-align-left">Disqus, Inc. ("Disqus," "we," or "us") provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of information that apply to our Service (as defined below), as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Overview.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Discuss offers an online public comment sharing platform where users may login and create profiles to participate in conversations with peers and enjoy an interactive experience. By using our comment sharing platform, software and website (collectively the "Service") you understand and agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. You further understand that the Service is a public platform and that we or other users may search for, see, use, or re-post any of your User Content (as defined below) that you post through the Service.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Advertising.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Advertising is the primary way Disqus makes money. We are paid by advertisers to serve and share advertising content. We may collect, use and share information from you when you use the Service in order to provide you with more relevant advertising. Detailed information about how we collect, use and share your information for advertising and other purposes is set forth below.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Applicability and third-party websites and services.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">This Privacy Policy only applies to the Service and does not apply to any website that uses the Service or other website linked to from the Service. We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from the Service, or the information or content contained thereon. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy is no longer applicable. Your browsing activity and interaction with any other website, including those that you link to from the Service or our website, is subject to that website's privacy policy.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Information Collection on the Service.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may collect information about you when you register for and use the Service. Such information may include "Personally Identifiable Information" which means information that identifies you as an individual, such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, email address, telephone number, username or account ID, and "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" which means information that does not identify you as an individual. Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include, but is not limited to, information about your browser, your IP address, device ID, what pages you visit on our Partner Sites, which website you came from, what advertisements you clicked on, whether on our Partner Websites, the Service or other third party websites, and other information about your online activity that does not identify you as an individual. The ways in which we collect, use and share both your Personally Identifiable Information and your Non-Personally Identifiable Information are described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We collect Personally Identifiable Information about you when you provide such information in connection with the Service such as when you register for the Service or when you send us an email. If you access the Service through a third-party connection or log-in, for example, through Facebook Connect, Google or Twitter, by "following," "liking," or linking your account to the Service, that third party may pass Personally Identifiable Information to us in connection with your account.</li>
<li>
<b>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</b> We may automatically collect and use Non-Personally Identifiable Information when you view and interact with the Service, Partner Sites or third party sites using tracking technologies such as cookies, web beacons, log files (described further below in the <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/466259-disqus-privacy-policy#cookies-and-other-technology" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cookies and Other Technology</a> section) and other similar technology. Non-Personally Identifiable Information may include, but is not limited to your browser information; device information, including unique device identifies ("UID"); location information, including IP address, GPS information; and other information about your use of the Service, your actions on the Service, Partner Sites, or third party websites , such as information about the content you viewed or interacted with, what pages you clicked on, what images or articles you viewed, whether you clicked on one of the advertisements, date and time information, navigation and click-through information, and other information about your online activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may combine such Non-Personally Identifiably Information with Personally Identifiable Information like your name or email address or other information that could be used to identify you in order to provide you with relevant advertising when visiting or using the Service, Partner Sites, third party websites or to send you email advertisements. We treat this combined information as personally identifiable information.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Information Collection on Partner Sites and Third Party Sites.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may receive and collect information from Partner Sites or other third parties. This information may include information about your usage of the Service on Partner Sites, including, but not limited to, the User Content posted on a Partner Site or other information about your interaction with a Partner Site. Information Collected from Partner Sites or third parties may be Personally Identifiable or Non-Personally Identifiable.</p>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Cookies and other Technology.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Cookie Information:</b> When you visit or use the Service, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Disqus help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service and Partner Sites (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take) and allows us to track your usage of the Service on Partner Sites over time. We may use both persistent cookies, which remain on your hard drive after you close your browser, and session cookies which terminate when you close your browser. If you have questions about disabling cookies, you should consult with your browser's manufacturer. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</li>
<li>
<b>Log File Information:</b> Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you use our Service, our servers automatically record certain log file information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, Partner Sites, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.</li>
<li>
<b>Clear Gifs/Web Beacons Information:</b> When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users. We may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened and which links or advertisements are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service and for us to provide you with advertisements that may interest you.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">Targeted Ads and Analytics Services.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may, and we may engage third parties who may, collect information, by using technologies such as cookies and web beacons, across various websites and devices, for the purpose of delivering more relevant advertisements on our behalf, or on the behalf of third parties, to you on the Service or third party websites, and to perform tracking and reporting functions for our Service, Partner Sites, or other third party websites, and the advertisements you view or click on.

<p class="intercom-align-left">The information that we collect about you, both Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information, may be used by us, or shared by us with third parties, in any manner and for any purpose permitted by law.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may include combining your, Non-Personally Identifiable Information, such as your IP address, device ID, a unique cookie recognized on your browser, or information associated with such Non-Personally Identifiable information, such as, device location, browsing history, whether collected on the Services, a Partner Site, or a third-party site with your Personally Identifiable Information, such as your email address, whether you provided it to us directly, or to a third party partner we engage . We, or third parties we engage, may use this combined information to send you information and advertisements, including by email, about our products or services or the products or services of third parties.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may also share this information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, including but not limited to, sending you more relevant advertising emails or offers for goods and services that may interest you. If you do not want us to share your Personally Identifying Information with third parties for their own marketing purposes, you may <a href="https://help.disqus.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1657951-data-sharing-settings" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">opt-out here</a>.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may access, preserve, and disclose your Personally Identifiable Information, account information, and User Content (as defined below) if we believe doing so is required or appropriate to comply with law enforcement requests and legal process, such as a court order, government request, or subpoena, or to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

<h4 class="intercom-align-left" data-post-processed="true">User Content.</h4>
<p class="intercom-align-left">We may collect and retain any comments or other content you send, post or provide through the Service ("User Content"); we treat this information as Personally Identifiable Information when it is combined and stored with Personally Identifiable Information. In all other cases we treat it as Non-Personally Identifiable Information, even where the User Content itself may identify you.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Following termination or deactivation of your Disqus account, we may retain and continue to use the information we have collected from you, including User Content, indefinitely.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">User Content posted to the Service is available to the public and may be viewed and used by others.

Please note, changing your privacy settings to private means that people cannot follow or track your account or view your comment history, anyone who visits a website where you left a comment, will still be able to see your comment and your profile may still be viewed by others. If you remove User Content from the Service, copies may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Service, or if other Users have copied or saved that information.</p>
<p class="intercom-align-left">Disqus reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the Service. We reserve the right, and Partner Sites also reserve the right, to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation if in our sole opinion such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Service, or to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party.
