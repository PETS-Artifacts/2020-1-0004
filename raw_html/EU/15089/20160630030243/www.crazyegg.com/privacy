		  <h1>Crazy Egg Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>This Privacy Policy is part of Crazy Egg's Terms of Use and describes the privacy practices of Crazy Egg, Inc. ("Crazy Egg", "we", "us", "our") on our websites located at <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com">http://www.crazyegg.com</a>, as well as such other websites or mobile applications that we own or operate  (collectively, "Our Website" or the "Crazy Egg Website") . We provide certain services to commercial users of Our Website (each, a "Client" and collectively, "Clients"), who, in turn, own and operate their own websites or mobile applications ("Client Site(s)"), and who wish to utilize our code, software and services and reports (the "Analysis Service(s)")  to analyze and obtain information regarding how third party visitors to their Client Sites ("Client Site Visitor(s)") are interacting with their Client Sites ("Visitor Information").  Users of Our Website may also include persons or entities who are otherwise visiting Our Website ("Other Users"). Below you can find information about when and how we collect information from Clients, Other Users, or Client Site Visitors ("you", or "your") or concerning your computer or device, including Personally Identifiable Information (defined below), how we use such Visitor Information, and the circumstances under which we may disclose such Visitor Information to others.</p>
<p>By visiting the Crazy Egg Website, visiting a Crazy Egg Client Site that provides notice of its use of Crazy Egg and/or this policy, or registering for our Analysis Service, you acknowledge that you accept and consent to the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>I. INFORMATION OBTAINED WHEN YOU VISIT CRAZY EGG OR OUR CLIENTS' SITES</h2>
<h4>Crazy Egg's Collection and Use of Visitor Information</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg Clients use the Analysis Service to obtain information regarding how Client Site Visitors to their Client Sites are interacting with such Client Sites ("Visitor Information"). This Analysis Service allows a Crazy Egg Client to evaluate and potentially modify its Client Site based on its findings regarding Client Site Visitors use and interaction with the Client Site. Please note that Crazy Egg itself uses the Crazy Egg Service to obtain insights into visitors' activities on <a href="http://www.crazyegg.com">http://www.crazyegg.com</a>.</p>
<h4>How Crazy Egg Collects Visitor Information</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg Clients use customized and proprietary software code provided by Crazy Egg to collect and transmit Visitor Information to Crazy Egg's servers. When a Client Site Visitor visits a Client Site that uses Crazy Egg's Analysis Service, this code contacts Crazy Egg's servers and enables Crazy Egg to collect and analyze the Client Site Visitor's activity while visiting the Client's Site. This information is then stored on web servers and databases utilized by Crazy Egg to perform analyses and produce reports for the Crazy Egg Client. The interactions that may be recorded or analyzed ("Recorded Interactions") may include mouse scrolls and clicks by a Client Site Visitor; keystrokes entered by a Client Site Visitor; and/or pages viewed or visited by a Client Site Visitor, including the duration of such visits. Recorded Interactions may also include images of the Client Site that are recorded during the Client Site Visitor's interactions with such Client Site, such as, by way of example, images of forms displayed or populated by the Client Site Visitor on the Client Site, or other multimedia content that may be posted by Client Site Visitors.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg may also collect certain information about a Client Visitor's computer or mobile device that may be furnished by the Client Visitor's browser or otherwise by the device ("Device Information"), such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browser Information</li>
<li>Operating System Information</li>
<li>Mobile Device Information (e.g., device identifier, mobile operating system, etc.)</li>
<li>IP Address</li>
<li>Page Accessed</li>
<li>Geographic Location</li>
<li>Time of Visit</li>
<li>Referring Site, Application, or Service</li>
</ul>
<p>Crazy Egg's Analysis Service is not designed to knowingly collect or extract from Visitor Information (including any Recorded Interactions or Device Information) information that could be used to personally identify Client Site Visitors, such as a Client Site Visitor's name, address or phone number ("Personally Identifiable Information") when a Client Site Visitor visits a Client Site that uses the Crazy Egg Analysis Service. In particular, Crazy Egg does not attempt to identify, decipher, or associate Personally Identifying Information regarding a Client Site Visitor from any Recorded Interactions or Device Information.</p>
<h4>Crazy Egg Does Not Collect Visitor Information Across Multiple Sites</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg does not collect or aggregate information about visitor behavior on multiple, different websites.</p>
<h4>Crazy Egg May Collect Information Contained in the "Referring URL" For The Last Website Visited</h4>
<p>If a Client Visitor navigates to a Client Site from another website, Crazy Egg may receive certain information from the referring website (i.e., the last website the visitor visited before visiting the client's website) as part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol ("HTTP") request. For example, if a Client Site Visitor navigates to a Client Site from a search engine, such as Google, Crazy Egg may receive information contained in the referring URL for the Google search query, such as the terms the Client Visitor was searching for before visiting the respective Client Site. Crazy Egg may use information contained in the referring URL to analyze and provide information to its Clients about the activities that led users to navigate to the applicable Client Site.</p>
<h4>Crazy Egg's Disclosure of Visitor Information</h4>
<p>Except as disclosed in Section II below, Crazy Egg never sells or shares any Visitor Information with individuals or companies other than the specific Client from whose Client Site Crazy Egg collected the Visitor Information.</p>
<p>This Visitor Information is provided to Clients in the form of aggregated reports and/or statistics that identify the collective behavior of Client Visitors to the Client's Site. Clients will also have access to Recorded Interactions through the Analysis Service.</p>
<h4>Our Clients' Use of Crazy Egg</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg expects its Clients to abide by all applicable laws, rules and regulations. Crazy Egg also requires each of its Clients to obtain any necessary consents from Client Visitors, post an online privacy policy that provides each Client Visitor with notice of its practices regarding data collection, use, and disclosure (including the Client's use of Crazy Egg), provide a link to the Crazy Egg Privacy Policy, and provide a link to the <a href="/opt-out">Crazy Egg Opt-out</a>. Nonetheless, Crazy Egg has no control over its Clients' activities, the disclosures made by its Clients on their Client Sites, or otherwise regarding Clients' compliance with the foregoing requirements, and Crazy Egg cannot be held responsible for, and hereby disclaims any liability for, any Client's failure to make these disclosures on its Client Sites, any failure by the Client to comply with applicable laws or covenants regarding Visitor Information, or its use of Visitor Information that is not permitted under this Privacy Policy or otherwise. For more details on the terms that apply to our Clients' use of the Crazy Egg Analysis Service, please see <a href="/terms">Crazy Egg's Terms of Use</a>.</p>
<h4 id="use_of_cookies">Use of Cookies</h4>
<p>As described in our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>, It is Crazy Egg's policy to use first-party cookies (small text files that Crazy Egg stores locally on your computer) on Client Sites for one or more of the following purposes: to  help identify whether a Client Site Visitor is a first time visitor, or has visited previously (provided that we will not store identifiers that can be used to personally identify such Client Site Visitors); assess usage patterns and perform traffic analysis; identify preferences; diagnose problems with our servers; analyze trends; and otherwise administer Crazy Egg products and services. Cookies placed by Crazy Egg on the computers of Client Site Visitors do not include Personally Identifiable Information such as name, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address, nor does Crazy Egg link cookies to such Personally Identifiable Information in its servers or databases.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to have Crazy Egg place and use cookies on your computer, you should set your browser preferences to refuse all cookies, including first-party cookies, before accessing Crazy Egg or other Client Sites that may use Crazy Egg. Crazy Egg is not responsible for any failure by you or your browser to accurately implement or communicate your browser preferences or settings. Please note that if you set your browser to reject cookies, some features of the Client Sites you visit may be unavailable. In addition, please be aware that even if you configure your browser settings to reject all cookies, your activity on Crazy Egg Client Sites will still be recorded by the Analysis Service. However, if you reject all cookies, Crazy Egg will not be able to determine whether or not someone using that computer previously visited the Client Site, i.e. whether or not the visitor is a "unique" visitor.</p>
<p>For more information on how to reject cookies, see your browser's instructions on changing your cookie settings. If you do not elect to set your browser preferences to refuse cookies, you consent to have cookies, including first-party cookies used by Crazy Egg, placed on your computer when you visit websites. For further information on our use of cookies, please see our <a href="/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>, which is incorporated in this Privacy Policy by this reference</p>
<h4 id="opting_out">Opting Out</h4>
<p>If you wish to opt out of Crazy Egg collecting Visitor Information when you visit Client Sites, please see the <a href="/opt-out">Crazy Egg Opt-out instructions</a>. Please note that if you use a different computer or Internet browser than you used when opting out of Crazy Egg's Analysis Service, Crazy Egg will not be able to view the opt-out and will collect Visitor Information when you visit Crazy Egg Client Sites. In these circumstances, you will need to revisit the link above in order to reset your opt-out decision, in order for it to be effective.</p>
<h4>Client Information</h4>
<p>When individuals or companies register as Clients to use the Crazy Egg Analysis Service, register to use a trial version of the Crazy Egg Analysis Service, or request additional information about Crazy Egg, Crazy Egg may require Personally Identifiable Information, such as name, e-mail mailing address, phone number, financial information (e.g., credit card number, billing address), and/or website to be tracked, to process the registration or request ("Client Information"). When a client registers for the Crazy Egg Analysis Service, some of these pieces of information may be temporarily stored in encrypted format in a session cookie (but are not stored or linked to a permanent cookie). Crazy Egg may use this information to process and fulfill your request, register your account, check your qualifications for registration and/or to bill you for products and services. Crazy Egg may also use Personally Identifiable Information you submit to us to provide Crazy Egg's products and services, personalize and tailor your experience on Crazy Egg, operate our business, understand how Clients are engaging with Crazy Egg, request additional information necessary to process or fulfill your order; determine if you are satisfied with the Crazy Egg Analysis Service; inform you that an upgrade is available; or to contact you with information about Crazy Egg, including information about new or existing products and services or special offers. For example, we may periodically send promotional materials or notifications related to our products and services to the email address associated with your account.</p>
<h4>Disclosure of Client Information to Third Parties</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg may disclose Client Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) or Device Information collected from or concerning Clients or potential Clients to third parties in the circumstances described below and in Section II of this Privacy Policy. By registering for or accessing Crazy Egg's products or services, you consent to such disclosure. This Policy does not apply to the policies or practices of any such third parties.</p>
<h4>Payment Processors</h4>
<p>Like many companies that accept payment by credit card, Crazy Egg relies on third-party payment processors to process financial payments, such as Authorize.net. When you make payments to Crazy Egg to obtain or use Crazy Egg's products or services, Crazy Egg may share Personally Identifiable Information, such as your name, address, and credit card information, with qualified third parties in order to process your order.</p>
<p>With the exception of the limited circumstances discussed above and in Section II, Crazy Egg does not provide Clients' Personally Identifiable Information to third parties for any purpose.</p>
<h4>Access to Personally Identifiable Information Stored at Crazy Egg</h4>
<p>At any time, a Crazy Egg Client may view and/or modify their Personally Identifiable Information stored by Crazy Egg by visiting the account preferences section of their Crazy Egg account, accessible <a href="/v2/account/profile">here</a>.</p>
<h2>II. PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO BOTH VISITOR AND CLIENT INFORMATION</h2>
<h4>Disclosure of Visitor Information and Client Information to Service Providers and Law Enforcement/Legal Process</h4>
<p>Visitor Information and/or Client Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) may be shared with certain third-party companies and individuals that help facilitate technical aspects of the Crazy Egg Service or perform functions related to the administration of Crazy Egg, such as third parties that provide storage facilities for certain Visitor Information and Client Information collected and analyzed by Crazy Egg. These third parties perform tasks on our behalf and are contractually obligated not to disclose or use Visitor Information or Client Information for any other purpose. However, Crazy Egg is not responsible in the event that Personally Identifiable Information is disclosed at a result of a breach or security lapse at any such third party, or for such third party's non-compliance with the foregoing requirements.</p>
<p>Crazy Egg also reserves the right to disclose any Visitor Information or Client Information (including Personally Identifiable Information) to: (i) comply with any law, regulation, or legal request; (ii) enforce, apply, or investigate breaches of the Terms of Use or other agreements; (iii) respond to public requests; or (iv) protect the rights, property, user experience, or safety of Crazy Egg, our employees, our users, or others. We may also share Client Information and Visitor Information with our affiliates, subject to their compliance with our obligations under this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use.</p>
<h4>Security and Protection of Visitor Information and Client Information</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg has implemented reasonable security mechanisms to protect Visitor Information and Client Information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. Examples of these security mechanisms include limited and password-protected access, firewalls, and SSL encryption to protect transmission of data. However, please keep in mind that no security system is impenetrable. It may be possible for third parties to intercept or access Visitor Information and Client Information. Crazy Egg cannot guarantee the security of such information and cannot be held responsible for and disclaims any liability for unauthorized access to Crazy Egg Client accounts.</p>
<h4>Policy Concerning Children Under Age of 13</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg does not knowingly or intentionally collect Personally Identifiable Information from children under 13. If we learn that we have Personally Identifiable Information of a child under age 13, we will remove it. If you believe we have Personally Identifiable Information about a child under the age of 13, please notify us at privacy@crazyegg.com.</p>
<h4>Change of Control</h4>
<p>If Crazy Egg, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired by another company or successor entity, Visitor Information and/or Client Information will be one of the assets transferred or acquired by the purchaser or successor. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any purchaser of or successor to Crazy Egg or its assets may continue to collect, use and disclose your information as set forth in this policy.</p>
<h4>Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg retains the discretion to amend or modify this policy from time to time. Use and disclosure of Information we obtain is subject to the later of: (1) the policy in effect at the time such Visitor Information or Client Information is collected or (2) any subsequent policy to which you agree or of which you have notice, if you elect to use Crazy Egg or a Crazy Egg Client Site (including the Crazy Egg Website) following such acceptance or notice. If we make material changes in the way we use or disclose Personally Identifiable Information, we will notify you through one or more of the following means: a direct communication to your Crazy Egg account, a communication to the e-mail address associated with your account, or a clear and prominent announcement on the Crazy Egg Website. Your continued access to or use of Crazy Egg or websites that use Crazy Egg following notice of material changes to this Privacy Policy shall constitute consent to any amendments and/or modifications.</p>
<h4>Do-Not-Track Signals</h4>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Our practices with respect to such signals are set forth in <a href="/opt-out">https://www.crazyegg.com/opt-out</a>.</p>
<h4>For More Information / Your Information Rights</h4>
<p>Crazy Egg welcomes any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, including regarding any disclosure of third party information for direct marketing purposes. Any such comments or questions should be submitted via e-mail to: privacy@crazyegg.com.</p>
<p>Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (the "Shine the Light" law), California residents who provide personal information in obtaining products or services for personal, family or household use are entitled to request and obtain from us once per calendar year certain disclosures about the personal information we shared, if any, with other businesses for their own direct marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories of personal information, and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared personal information, for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g. requests made in 2016 will receive information regarding 2015 sharing activities). To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@crazyegg.com with a subject line of "Request for California Privacy Information."  Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the "Shine the Light" requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response.</p>
<h4>Transfer of Data Abroad; International Users</h4>
<p>If you are visiting the Our Website or a Client Site from a country other than the United States of America the various communications will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting the Our Website or the Client Site, as applicable, you consent to the processing and transfer of your data as set out in this Privacy Policy. By using the Our Website or the Client Site, as applicable, you consent to the collection, storage, processing, and transfer of your information in and to the United States, or other countries and territories, pursuant to the laws of the United States.</p>

<h4>Effective Date of this Privacy Policy:</h4>
<p>This Terms of Use is effective as of June 28, 2016.</p>
