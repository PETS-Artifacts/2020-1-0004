      <p>We may transfer your Personal Information to recipients in other countries. Ziff Davis participates in the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield, the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield and the APEC Cross Border Privacy Rules System. Where we transfer User Information from the European Economic Area ("<b>EEA</b>") to a recipient outside the EEA that is not in an adequate jurisdiction, we do so on the basis of standard contractual clauses.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Because of the international nature of our business, we may need to transfer your User Information within the Ziff Davis group of companies, and to third parties as noted in Section 9 above, in connection with the purposes set out in this Policy. For this reason, we may transfer your User Information to other countries that may have different laws and data protection compliance requirements to those that apply in the country in which you are located.</p>
    <p>Ziff Davis, LLC and its U.S. subsidiaries IGN Entertainment, Inc., emedia Communications, LLC, Salesify, Inc. d/b/a B2BSignals, Offers.com, LLC, and Ookla, LLC participate in and have certified its compliance with the E.U.-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework.

You may request a copy of the relevant standard contractual clauses using the contact details provided in Section 17 below.</p>
    <p>Please note that when you transfer any Personal Information directly to a Company entity established outside the EEA, we are not responsible for that transfer of your Personal Information.

If you no longer wish to receive these types of communications, you may turn them off at the device level.
