[LINK] 3.5 Does the Mediahuis Group transfer your personal data to countries outside the European Economic Area?&gt; [expand] The European Economic Area (EEA) includes all countries of the European Union and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. The European legislation requires additional safeguards if a Mediahuis Entity transfers personal data to other countries situated outside the EEA. The European legislator imposes appropriate safeguards to controllers to assure that such countries maintain the same level of protection with regard to your personal data. A Mediahuis Entity shall transfer your personal data to recipients outside the European Economic Area for certain processing. In such a case, the Mediahuis Entity shall warrant that the transfer is covered by the appropriate safeguards, including an adequacy decision of the European Commission, the Model Clauses of the European Commission or the EU-US privacy shield.

This allows you to rectify or correct, inaccurate or incorrect personal data a Mediahuis Entity processes. • You have the right to have your personal data erased. This allows you to permanently delete personal data which a Mediahuis Entity processes. A Mediahuis Entity is not always obliged to delete your personal data at your request – this right only applies in the situations and to the extent provided for by law. • You have the right to limit the processing of personal data related to you. This allows you to freeze the use of your personal data by a Mediahuis Entity, without deleting it.
