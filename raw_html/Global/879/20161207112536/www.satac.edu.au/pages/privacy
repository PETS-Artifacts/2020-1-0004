</p>
<p>
  <span>The information provided in your SATAC application(s) will be used:</span>
</p>
<ul>

    <span>to identify you as the owner of the data you have provided</span>

</p>
<p>Individuals have a right to request access to the personal information SATAC holds. If any of the personal information is incorrect in your opinion, you have the right to request the correction of the information. If we are lawfully unable to provide access to or correct your personal information we will notify you in writing and provide our reasons.

</p>
<p>
  <span>SATAC&rsquo;s Privacy Officer will ensure that any requests for access to personal information or for the correction of personal information not available to clients through SATAC&rsquo;s web-based services are dealt with in a reasonable period from receiving the request and in accordance with the following procedures.</span>

<p>
  <span>Access</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>typically there will be no reason why an individual may not have access to their records</li>
  <li>if a request for access is accepted, an individual will be granted access to their personal information in the manner requested by them, providing it is practicable to do so. If the manner requested is not practicable, SATAC will work with the individual to provide access in a manner that is acceptable to both parties</li>

  <li>if a request for correction is accepted, or SATAC is otherwise satisfied that personal information held by it is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading, having regard to the purpose for which it is held, SATAC will take reasonable steps to correct the information</li>
  <li>where SATAC refuses to make a correction to personal information requested by an individual, it will, at the request of that individual, take reasonable steps to associate a statement to that personal information to the effect that the information is inaccurate, out of date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading</li>
  <li>
    <span>if SATAC corrects personal information that it has disclosed to another entity it will, at the request of the individual, notify that other entity of the correction, providing that it is lawful and practicable to do so</span>
