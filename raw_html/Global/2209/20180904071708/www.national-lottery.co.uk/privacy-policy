				<p>We send you marketing communications through a number of different channels and via our advertising partners. You will receive direct marketing by email if you have opened a National Lottery account through our website and have either consented to receive such email marketing during account registration, and/or have not asked us to stop sending direct marketing by email to you.</p>
				<p><strong>How to opt out of direct marketing</strong></p>
				<p>You can opt out from receiving direct marketing communications and notifications from us at any time. There are several ways you can do this:</p>
				<ul class="list list_dots_gray">
					<li>To stop receiving marketing by email, either:
						<ul class="list list_dots_gray">
							<li>click 'unsubscribe' in any email communication we send you; or</li>
							<li>login to your National Lottery account, visit <a href="/my-account/email-preferences?icid=bsp:na:tx">Email preferences</a>, and untick all of the email categories.</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>To stop receiving push notifications on your mobile device, switch off the relevant option in the ‘Settings’ section of your device.</li>
					<li>To stop receiving push notifications in your browser, switch off the relevant options in the ‘Settings’ section of your browser. See our <a href="/contact-us#Unsubscribing-from-notifications">help page</a> for further information on how to do this in various browsers.</li>
					<li><a href="#contactus">Write to us</a></li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Personalisation</strong></p>
				<p>We want to give you the best possible experience when you play The National Lottery and when we communicate with you. To do this we want to understand our players, what games you play and how you use our app or website. We use this information to offer you promotions that are most likely to interest you and to personalise our communications and content to make them relevant.</p>
				<p><strong>How can I stop my personal data being used for direct marketing?</strong></p>
				<p>If you would like us to stop using your personal data to personalise marketing to you, you can switch off personalisation in your <a href="/my-account/personalisation-settings?icid=bsp:na:tx">Personalisation settings</a>, within your account. If you choose to switch off personalised direct marketing, you will continue to receive marketing communications and notifications from us, however they will not be personalised to you. You can find out more about what personalisation means <a href="/my-account/personalisation-settings?icid=bsp:na:tx">here</a>.</p>
				<p>To stop all direct marketing (including both marketing communications/notifications and personalisation) you must opt out of both. Please note that our systems may take up to 72 hours to update after changing your preferences.</p>
				<p><strong>Sharing your information with our marketing partners</strong></p>
				<p>We may share your data with our marketing partners, including advertisers, advertising networks and agencies to provide targeted advertising or to exclude you from our targeted advertising. We may also share your data with social media providers, including Facebook for custom audiences (for information on to opt out of Facebook custom audiences see the information provided by Facebook in its Help Centre (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/1415256572060999" class="ico ico_after ico_window" target="_blank" title="Facebook help centre - opens in a new window">www.facebook.com/help/1415256572060999</a>).</p>
