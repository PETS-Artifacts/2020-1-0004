           <h2>Use of Cookies on our site</h2>
                <p><em><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></em> A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or mobile device when you  visit one of our web pages. </p>
                <p> Certain cookies contain personal information although most cookies will not collect information that personally identifies you. They will collect more general information such as how users arrive at and use websites, or a user's general location. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come (i.e.<strong> www.ourhouseplants.com</strong>), the  &quot;lifetime&quot; of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.</p>
                <p>Two types of cookies may be used; session cookies, which  are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser  until you leave the site and persistent cookies; which remain in the cookie file of your browser for a longer period.</p>
                <p><em><strong>How does ourhouseplants.com directly use cookies?</strong></em> Like the majority of all websites, when you visit our site we send you a cookie. Currently cookies may be used by us in the following ways: </p>
               
		   <div id="contentlists">
 
         <ul>
