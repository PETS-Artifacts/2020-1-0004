<h2>Use of Cookies on our site</h2>
<p><em><strong>What is a cookie?</strong></em> A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that is stored on your browser or the hard drive of your computer or mobile device when you visit one of our web pages. </p>

<div id="contentlists">
<ul>

</ul>
</div>

<h2>Links to Outside Websites</h2>
<p> Any website which we directly link to outside of the <strong>www.ourhouseplants.com</strong> domain is done so in good faith that we are directing you some where worthwhile and "safe".
