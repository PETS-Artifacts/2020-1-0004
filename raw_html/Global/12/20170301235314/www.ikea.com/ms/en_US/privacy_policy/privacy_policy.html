Cookies can be disabled in your web browser.<br><br>When you visit our web site, we also collect anonymous information from you. This includes the Internet browser you are using; the computer operating system you are using, time spent visiting the web site, usage patterns within the web site, and the domain name of the web site from which you linked to our site. This information is not matched to your personal information and does not personally identify you. We collect this information to help improve your experience on the web site. Additionally, IKEA may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with the law or protect our interests and property.

Your contact information which you provide through the customer profile process (described above) is retained until you request us to delete or change it. Information which is created as part of your shopping experience, such as shopping lists, price offers, personal planners and designs, is retained for varying periods up to two years. Certain information is retained for longer periods for our internal audit and quality control purposes.</p>
					
        
				
	            	<p><b>Does IKEA share the information it obtains about me with third parties?</b><br>IKEA does not share personal information about its consumers with any third parties outside the IKEA corporate family for their own marketing purposes. However, we may do so within the IKEA corporate family. We do share this information with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf, but these service providers are not authorized by us to use or disclose the information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf or to comply with legal requirements. We also may disclose information about you as required by law.<br>We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. If the business is transferred, we will provide you with the opportunity to tell us that you would prefer that information about you not be transferred. Should such a transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information about you in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.</p>
