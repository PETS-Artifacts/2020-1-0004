We can&#x2019;t speak to the privacy\n                    practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their\n                    privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.\n                \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n                \u003Cp\u003E\n                    \u003Cstrong\u003EService Providers\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride\n                    you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If\n                    you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with Lyft, we\n                    may share information about your use of Lyft Platform with your\n                    organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and\n                    region of the trip.

(Please remember to check and set your designation\n                    settings accordingly.) If you integrate your account with an expense\n                    platform (like Concur) we will share the ride details to your expense\n                    account.\n                \u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n                \u003Cp\u003E\n                    \u003Cstrong\u003EInternational Partners\u003C\u002Fstrong\u003E.

                Lyft Privacy Policy
            </h1>
            <p><em>Last Updated: February 8, 2017</em></p>
            <p>
                At Lyft, we want to connect people through transportation and bring
                communities together. In this privacy policy, we tell you what information
                we receive from Lyft riders and drivers, and how we use it to connect
                riders with drivers and continue to improve our services. Below, we
                explain how you can share with other riders and drivers in the Lyft
                community as part of our mission to bring people together.

            <p>
                Lyft (&#x201C;Lyft,&#x201D; &#x201C;we,&#x201D; &#x201C;our,&#x201D; and/or &#x201C;us&#x201D;) values the privacy of individuals
                who use our application, websites, and related services (collectively, the
                &#x201C;Lyft Platform &#x201D;). This privacy policy (the &#x201C;Privacy Policy&#x201D;) explains how
                we collect, use, and share information from Lyft users (&#x201C;Users&#x201D;),
                comprised of both Lyft riders (&#x201C;Riders&#x201D;) and Lyft drivers  (including
                Driver applicants) (&#x201C;Drivers&#x201D;). Beyond the Privacy Policy, your use of
                Lyft is also subject to our Terms of Service (

            <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
            <section id="privacy-information-you-provide-to-us">
                <h3>A.  Information You Provide to Us</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Registration Information</strong>. When you sign up for a Lyft
                    account, you give us your name, email address, and phone number. If
                    you decide to sign up for Lyft using your Facebook account, we will
                    also get basic information from your Facebook profile like your name,
                    gender, profile photo, and Facebook friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>User Profile Information</strong>. When you join the Lyft
                    community, you can create a Lyft Profile to share fun facts about
                    yourself, and discover mutual friends and interests. Filling out a
                    profile is optional, and you can share as little or as much as you
                    want. Your name (and for Drivers, Profile photos) is always part of
                    your Profile. Read more below about how you can control who sees your
                    Profile. You can also add a Business Profile to your account, which
                    requires a designated business email address and payment method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Payment Method</strong>. When you add a credit card or payment
                    method to your Lyft account, a third party that handles payments for
                    us will receive your card information. To keep your financial data
                    secure, we do not store full credit card information on our servers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Communications</strong>. If you contact us directly, we may
                    receive additional information about you. For example, when you
                    contact our Customer Support Team, we will receive your name, email
                    address, phone number, the contents of a message or attachments that
                    you may send to us, and other information you choose to provide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Driver Application Information</strong>. If you decide to join
                    our Lyft driver community, in addition to the basic registration
                    information we ask you for your date of birth, physical address,
                    Social Security number, driver&#x2019;s license information, vehicle
                    information, car insurance information, and in some jurisdictions we
                    may collect additional business license or permitting information. We
                    share this information with our partners who help us by running
                    background checks on Drivers to help protect the Lyft community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Payment Information</strong>. To make sure Drivers get paid,
                    we keep information about Drivers&#x2019; bank routing numbers, tax
                    information, and any other payment information provided by Drivers.
                </p>

                <h3>B.  Information We Collect When You Use the Lyft Platform</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Location Information</strong>. Lyft is all about connecting
                    Drivers and Riders. To do this, we need to know where you are. When
                    you open Lyft on your mobile device, we receive your location. We may
                    also collect the precise location of your device when the app is
                    running in the foreground or background. If you label certain
                    locations, such as &#x201C;home&#x201D; and &#x201C;work,&#x201D; we receive that information,
                    too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your location information is necessary for things like matching Riders
                    with nearby Drivers, determining drop off and pick up locations, and
                    suggesting destinations based on previous trips. Also, if the need
                    ever arises, our Trust &amp; Safety team may use and share location
                    information to help protect the safety of Lyft Users or a member of
                    the public. In addition to the reasons described above, Drivers&#x2019;
                    location information and distance travelled is necessary for
                    calculating charges and insurance for Lyft rides. If you give us
                    permission through your device settings or Lyft app, we may collect
                    your location while the app is off to identify promotions or service
                    updates in your area.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Device Information</strong>. Lyft receives information from
                    Users&#x2019; devices, including IP address, web browser type, mobile
                    operating system version, phone carrier and manufacturer, application
                    installations, device identifiers, mobile advertising identifiers,
                    push notification tokens, and, if you register with your Facebook
                    account, your Facebook identifier. We collect mobile sensor data from
                    Drivers&#x2019; devices (such as speed, direction, height, acceleration or
                    deceleration) to improve location accuracy and analyze usage patterns.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Usage Information</strong>. To help us understand how you use
                    the Lyft Platform and to help us improve it, we automatically receive
                    information about your interactions with the Lyft Platform, like the
                    pages or other content you view, your actions within the Lyft app, and
                    the dates and times of your visits.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Call and Text Information</strong>. We work with a third party
                    partner to facilitate phone calls and text messages between Riders and
                    Drivers who have been connected for a ride. We receive information
                    about these communications including the date and time of the call or
                    SMS message, the parties&#x2019; phone numbers, and the content of any SMS
                    messages.  For security purposes, we may also monitor and/or record
                    the contents of phone calls made on the Lyft Platform, such as those
                    between Riders and Drivers.  You will be given notice that your call
                    may be recorded, and by proceeding you agree to allow Lyft to monitor
                    and/or record your call.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>User Feedback</strong>. At Lyft, we want to make sure Users
                    are always enjoying great rides. Riders and Drivers may rate and
                    review each other at the end of every ride. We receive information
                    about ratings and reviews and, as we explain below, give Riders
                    information about Drivers&#x2019; ratings and reviews and vice versa.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Address Book Contacts</strong>. If you permit Lyft to access
                    the address book on your device through the permission system used by
                    your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact
                    information from your address book to facilitate invitations and
                    social interactions that you initiate through our Platform and for
                    other purposes described in this privacy policy or at the time of
                    consent or collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Information from Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong>. We
                    collect information through the use of &#x201C;cookies&#x201D;, tracking pixels, and
                    similar technologies to understand how you navigate through the Lyft
                    Platform and interact with Lyft advertisements, to learn what content
                    is popular, and to save your preferences. Cookies are small text files
                    that web servers place on your device; they are designed to store
                    basic information and to help websites and apps recognize your
                    browser.  We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A
                    session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent
                    cookie remains after you close your browser and may be accessed every
                    time you use the Lyft Platform.  You should consult your web
                    browser(s) to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you
                    delete or choose not to accept cookies from us, you may be missing out
                    on certain features of the Lyft Platform.

                <h3>C.  Information We Collect from Third Parties</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Third Party Services</strong>. If you choose to register for
                    Lyft or otherwise link your Lyft account with a third party&#x2019;s service
                    (such as Facebook), we may receive the same type of information we
                    collect from you (described above) directly from those services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Third Party Partners</strong>. We may receive additional
                    information about you, such as demographic data, payment information,
                    or fraud detection information, from third party partners and combine
                    it with other information that we have about you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Enterprise Programs</strong>. If your company, university, or
                    organization participates in one of our enterprise programs such as
                    Lyft for Work, we may receive information about you, such as your
                    email address, from your participating organization. We also may give
                    your participating organization the opportunity to request a ride on
                    your behalf, in which case they may provide us with your name, phone
                    number, and the pickup and drop off location for your ride.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Background Information on Drivers</strong>. Lyft works with
                    third party partners to perform driving record and criminal background
                    checks on Drivers, and we receive information from them such as
                    publicly available information about a Driver&#x2019;s driving record or
                    criminal history.

            <h2>How We Share the Information We Collect</h2>
            <section id="privacy-sharing-between-users">
                <h3>A. Sharing Between Users</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sharing between Riders and Drivers</strong>. Riders and Drivers that
                    have been matched for a ride are able to see basic information about
                    each other, such as names, photo, ratings, and any information they
                    have added to their Profiles. Riders and Drivers who connect their
                    Lyft accounts to Facebook will also be able to see their mutual
                    Facebook friends during the ride. Drivers see the pick-up location
                    that the Rider has provided. Riders see a Driver&#x2019;s vehicle information
                    and real-time location as the Driver approaches the pick-up location.
                    Riders&#x2019; ratings of Drivers are shared with Drivers on a weekly basis.
                    We de-identify the ratings and feedback, but we can&#x2019;t rule out that a
                    driver may be able to identify the Rider that provided the rating or
                    feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although we help Riders and Drivers communicate with one another to
                    arrange a pickup, we do not share your actual phone number or other
                    contact information with other Users.  If you report a lost or found
                    item to us, we will seek to connect you with the relevant Rider or
                    Driver, including sharing actual contact information with your
                    permission.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Sharing between Lyft Line Riders</strong>. If you use Lyft
                    Line, Riders who have been matched with you will be able to see your
                    name, photo and any information you have added to your Profile. If you
                    connect your Lyft account to Facebook (such as by signing up through
                    Facebook), we may show your mutual friends with other Riders who are
                    also connected via Facebook.  During the Lyft Line matching process we
                    may show photos of possible matches to you and other Riders.

                <h3>B. Sharing Between Lyft and Third Parties</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>API and Integration Partners</strong>.  If you connect to the
                    Lyft Platform through an integration with a third party service, we
                    may share information about your use of the Lyft Platform with that
                    third party.  We may share your information with our third party
                    partners in order to receive additional information about you.  We may
                    also share your information with third party partners to create offers
                    that may be of interest to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Third Party Services</strong>.  The Lyft Platform may allow
                    you to connect with other websites, products, or services that we
                    don&#x2019;t have control over (for example, we may give you the ability to
                    order a food delivery from a restaurant from within the Lyft app). If
                    you use these services, we will provide the third party with
                    information about you to allow them to provide the service to you (for
                    example, we would give the restaurant your name, phone number and
                    address to drop off the food).  We can&#x2019;t speak to the privacy
                    practices of these third parties, and we encourage you to read their
                    privacy policies before deciding whether to use their services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Service Providers</strong>.  We work with third party service
                    providers to perform services on our behalf, and we may share your
                    information with such service providers to help us provide the Lyft
                    Platform, including all of the things described in Section 3 above.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>.  If you participate in an
                    enterprise program and charge a ride to your organization&#x2019;s billing
                    method or credits, we will provide your organization&#x2019;s account holder
                    with information about your use of the Lyft Platform, including ride
                    details such as date, time, charge, and pick up and drop off
                    locations. If you create a Business Profile, at the end of each ride
                    you will have the option to designate the ride as a business ride. If
                    you do so, and your organization has a corporate account with Lyft, we
                    may share information about your use of Lyft Platform with your
                    organization including ride details such as date, time, charge, and
                    region of the trip. If you change organizations, it is your
                    responsibility to update your Business Profile with the new
                    information.  (Please remember to check and set your designation
                    settings accordingly.) If you integrate your account with an expense
                    platform (like Concur) we will share the ride details to your expense
                    account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>International Partners</strong>.  We&#x2019;ve partnered with several
                    ride-sharing services around the globe so Riders can continue to find
                    rides when they open the Lyft app abroad, and Drivers can provide
                    services to international travelers in the U.S.  When we match a ride
                    with the partner, we share the same information that is shared between
                    matched Riders and Drivers on the Lyft Platform. In some cases we are
                    unable to mask your phone number if you call an international driver,
                    so please keep that in mind before using this feature.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Other Sharing</strong>.  We may share your information with
                    third parties in the following cases:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        While negotiating or in relation to a change of corporate control

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If a government authority requests information and we think
                        disclosure is required or appropriate in order to comply with
                        laws, regulations, or a legal process;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or third
                        parties if we think doing so is necessary to protect the rights,
                        property, or safety of the Lyft community, Lyft, or the public
                        (you can read more about this in our

                    <li>
                        To provide information about the use of the Lyft Platform to
                        potential business partners in aggregated or de-identified form
                        that can&#x2019;t reasonably be used to identify you; and

            <h2>Your Choices</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Email Subscriptions</strong>. You can always unsubscribe from our
                commercial or promotional emails but we will still send you transactional
                and relational emails about your account use of the Lyft Platform.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Text Messages</strong>. You can opt out of receiving commercial or
                promotional text messages by texting the word END to 46080 from the mobile
                device receiving the messages.  You may also opt out of receiving all
                texts from Lyft (including transactional or relational messages) by
                texting the word STOPALL to 46080 from the mobile device receiving the
                messages, however, opting out of receiving all texts may impact your use
                of the Lyft Platform.  Drivers can also opt out of driver-specific
                messages by texting STOP in response to a driver SMS.  To re-enable texts
                you can text START in response to an unsubscribe confirmation SMS.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Push Notifications</strong>.  You can opt out of receiving push
                notifications through your device settings.  Please note that opting out
                of receiving push notifications may impact your use of the Lyft Platform
                (such as receiving a notification that your ride has arrived).
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Profile Information</strong>. While your name will always be
                shared with Drivers and fellow Lyft Line Riders, you can delete any
                additional information that you added to your Profile at any time if you
                don&#x2019;t want Drivers and Lyft Line Riders to see it. Riders will always be
                able to see Drivers&#x2019; names, rating, profile photos, and vehicle
                information.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Location Information</strong>. While you can prevent your device
                from sharing location information at any time through your Device&#x2019;s
                operating system settings, Rider and Driver location is core to the Lyft
                Platform and without it we can&#x2019;t provide our services to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Facebook Friends</strong>. You can control whether to enable or

            <p>
                <strong>Editing and Accessing Your Information</strong>. You can review
                and edit certain account information by logging in to your account
                settings and profile (Drivers may edit additional information through the
                Driver portal). If would like to terminate your Lyft account, please

                will deactivate it for you but may retain information from your account
                for a certain period of time and disclose it in a manner consistent with
                our practices under this Privacy Policy for accounts that are not closed.
                We also may retain information from your account to collect any fees owed,
                resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, analyze usage of the Lyft
