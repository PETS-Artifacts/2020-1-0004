     <h1>Horizon Hobby Privacy Policy</h1>
	<p>Last updated: May 2018</p>
	<p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what personal data Horizon Hobby collects from you, through our interactions with you, and how we use that data.</p>
	<p>Horizon Hobby offers a wide range of websites to assist customers across the globe. Please read the site-specific details in this privacy statement, which provide additional details about some of Horizon Hobby's websites.</p>
	<p>You can freely access much of our websites without providing any personal information. But certain functions of our website, for example purchasing products, entering contests, filling out surveys, and receiving newsletters, emails, or other promotional information from us, require that you submit some personal information. We do not collect any personal information without providing adequate notice and choice.</p>
	<section>
		<h2>1. Your Rights Concerning Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
		<p>You always have the right to request information about your stored data, its origin, its recipients, and the purpose of its collection at no charge. You also have the right to request that it be corrected, blocked, or deleted. You can contact us at any time at <a href="mailto:webmaster@horizonhobby.com?subject=feedback">webmaster@horizonhobby.com</a> if you have further questions about privacy and data protection.</p>
		<div>
			<a class="dynamic-action hide"  data-rel="reveal-1" aria-live="polite" aria-live="polite">Learn More</a>
		</div>
		<div class="reveal" id="reveal-1">
			<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You may revoke consent for these data processing operations at any time to stop future processing. An informal email making this request is sufficient. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed depending on the nature of the data and Horizon Hobby's legal requirements or legitimate interest in such data.</p>
			<p>You have the right to have data which we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you require direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible. Horizon Hobby may require reasonable actions of the requester, such as the use of confirmation codes, prior to delivery, to protect users' personal information from potential malicious third parties.</p>
			<p>If there has been a breach of data protection legislation, the person affected may file a complaint with the competent regulatory authorities. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection in the European Union is the data protection officer of the German state in which our subsidiary, Horizon Hobby GmbH, is headquartered, Schleswig-Holstein. The contact information for the data protection officer for Schleswig-Holstein can be found at the following link: <a href="https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Adressen/LfD/SchleswigHolstein.html" target="blank">https://www.bfdi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Adressen/LfD/SchleswigHolstein.html</a>. The competent regulatory authority for matters related to data protection in the United States is the Federal Trade Commission, which receives complaints at <a href="https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/" target="blank">https://www.ftccomplaintassistant.gov/</a>.</p>

		<h2>3. Types of Data We Collect</h2>
		<p>Our goal is to provide you with the best and most efficient service as possible so you can get back to your hobbies. Horizon Hobby collects data to help us provide this service. We use the data that we collect about you to fulfill your product and service purchases and to create a personalized online experience. In order to better provide you with these products and services, our websites collect two types of information about users: Personally Identifiable and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>
		<div>
			<a class="dynamic-action hide" data-rel="reveal-2" aria-live="polite">Learn More</a>
		</div>
		<div class="reveal" id="reveal-2">
			<h3>Non-Personal Data We Collect</h3>
			<p>We gather certain information about you based upon where you shop on our site in several ways. This information is compiled and analyzed on both an individual and aggregated basis. For example, this information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you came from, the URL you go to next, the browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the World Wide Web. Networks like the Web use TCP/IP to route information based on the IP address of the destination. In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web and allows web servers to locate and identify your computer. Computers require IP addresses for users to communicate on the Internet, browse, and shop.</p>
			<h3>Personal Data We Collect</h3>
			<p>Personal information is requested when you order a product, register for a Wish List, enter contests or sweepstakes, fill out surveys, send us feedback, and send us mailings. For example, this information might include but is not limited to your name, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, email address, credit card or other payment information, and product details. With this information, our online catalog can fill your orders and better provide you with personalized services.</p>
			<p>Most personal information collected by Horizon Hobby is necessary for completion of purchase orders. Other personal data is collected with your consent. Horizon Hobby works to provide users with as much relevant information as possible prior to collecting any personal data.</p>

		<h2>4. How We Collect Data</h2>
		<h3>Cookies</h3>
		<p>Some of our web pages include cookies. You can configure your browser to selectively or always reject cookies. But disabling or rejecting cookies may limit the functionality of this website. Cookies, which are necessary to allow electronic communications or to provide certain functions you use, are stored pursuant to GDPR Art. 6(1)(f), which allows the processing for a legitimate interest. Horizon Hobby has a legitimate interest in the storage of cookies to ensure an optimized service provided free of technical errors. Cookies stored for other purposes, such as customizing your online experience, are treated separately in this privacy policy.</p>

		<div class="reveal" id="reveal-3">
			<p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer and saved by your browser. Cookies do not harm your computer and do not contain any viruses.

			<p>You can configure your browser or browser plug-ins to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie.

These data are not combined with data from other sources. The basis for data processing is GDPR Art. 6(1)(b), which allows the processing of data to fulfill a contract or for measures preliminary to a contract.</p>
		<h3>Contact Forms</h3>
		<p>Should you send us questions via the contact form, we will collect the data entered on the form, including the contact details you provide to answer your question and any follow-up questions. We do not share this information without your permission. Therefore, we will process data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent under GDPR Art. 6(1)(a). You may revoke your consent at any time by sending an informal email request to <a href="mailto:webmaster@horizonhobby.com?subject=feedback">webmaster@horizonhobby.com</a>.

To inform you about important changes, such as those within the scope of our site or technical changes, we will use the email address specified during registration. You may unsubscribe from these emails using the link provided in the email.</p>
		</div>
		<h3>Leaving Comments on Horizon Hobby Websites</h3>
		<p>Some Horizon Hobby websites allow you to leave comments or reviews. If you use the comment or review function on the sites, the time at which you created the comment and your email address will be stored along with your comment, as well as your username, unless you are posting anonymously. Our comment or review function may store the IP address of those users who posted. We need this information to be able to pursue actions for illegal or slanderous content. The comments and reviews are stored based on your consent under GDPR Art. 6(1)(a). You may revoke your consent at any time by sending an informal email request to <a href="mailto:webmaster@horizonhobby.com?subject=feedback">webmaster@horizonhobby.com</a>. Mandatory provisions, especially mandatory data retention periods or obligations to maintain records</p>

But if you have submitted comments or provided the data to us for another purpose or elsewhere, those comments or data will not be deleted.

		<h3>Analytics and Advertising</h3>
		<p>Some Horizon Hobby websites use third-party analytics and advertising services to a custom and optimized user experience from our websites and their advertising. Horizon Hobby pages may include the analytics and advertising services of Google Analytics, Google Analytics Remarking, Google reCAPTCHA, Facebook Web Beacon, or BazaarVoice Web Beacon. Collection of this data may come in the form of cookies, web beacons, or plugins. General information about how cookies, web beacons, and plugins work can be found above in the sections titled Cookies, Web beacons, and Social Media Plugins, respectively. Horizon Hobby has a legitimate interest in providing optimized user experience from our websites and their advertising. Thus, the basis for data processing under the GDPR is Art. 6(1)(f). Information about each of the analytics and advertising services used on Horizon Hobby websites can be found under the Learn More section of this provision.</p>

			<h4>Google Analytics</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service. It is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
			<p>Google Analytics uses cookies. These are text files that are stored on your computer and that allow an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>
			<p>Google Analytics cookies are stored based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
			<h5>IP anonymization</h5>
			<p>We have activated the IP anonymization feature on this website. Your IP address will be shortened by Google within the European Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area prior to transmission to the United States. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address sent to a Google server in the US and shortened there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity, and to provide other services regarding website activity and Internet usage for the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with any other data held by Google.</p>
			<h5>Browser plugin</h5>
			<p>You can prevent these cookies being stored by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser. However, we wish to point out that doing so may mean you will not be able to enjoy the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the data generated by cookies about your use of the website (including your IP address) from being passed to Google, and the processing of these data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>.</p>
			<h5>Objecting to the collection of data</h5>
			<p>You can prevent the collection of your data by Google Analytics by clicking on the following link. An opt-out cookie will be set to prevent your data from being collected on future visits to this site: Disable Google Analytics.</p>
			<p>For more information about how Google Analytics handles user data, see Google's privacy policy: <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/#topic=3544906" target="_blank">www.support.google.com/analytics/</a>.</p>
			<h5>Outsourced data processing</h5>
			<p>We have entered into an agreement with Google for the outsourcing of our data processing and fully implement the strict requirements of the German data protection authorities when using Google Analytics.</p>
			<h5>Demographic data collection by Google Analytics</h5>
			<p>This website uses Google Analytics' demographic features. This allows reports to be generated containing statements about the age, gender, and interests of site visitors. This data comes from interest-based advertising from Google and third-party visitor data. This collected data cannot be attributed to any specific individual person. You can disable this feature at any time by adjusting the ads settings in your Google account or you can forbid the collection of your data by Google Analytics as described in the section "Refusal of data collection."</p>
			<h4>Google Analytics Remarketing</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use the features of Google Analytics Remarketing to combine with the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and DoubleClick. This service is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA.</p>
			<p>This feature makes it possible to link target audiences for promotional marketing created with Google Analytics Remarketing to the cross-device capabilities of Google AdWords and Google DoubleClick. This allows advertising to be displayed based on your personal interests, based on your previous usage and surfing behavior on one device (e.g. your mobile phone), and based on your usage on other devices (such as a tablet or computer).</p>
			<p>Once you have given your consent, Google will associate your web and app browsing history with your Google Account for this purpose. That way, any device that signs in to your Google Account can use the same personalized promotional messaging.</p>
			<p>To support this feature, Google Analytics collects Google-authenticated IDs of users that are temporarily linked to our Google Analytics data to define and create audiences for cross-device ad promotion.</p>
			<p>You can permanently opt out of cross-device remarketing/targeting by turning off personalized advertising in your Google Account; follow this link: <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/" target="_blank">www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/</a>.</p>
			<p>The aggregation of the data collected in your Google Account data is based solely on your consent, which you may give or withdraw from Google under GDPR Art. 6(1)(a). For data collection operations not merged into your Google Account (for example, because you do not have a Google Account or have objected to the merge), the collection of data is based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). Horizon Hobby has a legitimate interest in analyzing anonymous user behavior for promotional purposes.</p>

			<h4>Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby websites may use Google AdWords. AdWords is an online advertising program from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, United States ("Google").</p>
			<p>As part of Google AdWords, we use so-called conversion tracking. When you click on an ad served by Google, a conversion tracking cookie is set. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser stores on your computer. These cookies expire after 30 days and are not used for personal identification of the user. Should the user visit certain pages of the website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and the website can tell that the user clicked on the ad and proceeded to that page.</p>
			<p>Each Google AdWords advertiser has a different cookie. Thus, cookies cannot be tracked using the website of an AdWords advertiser. The information obtained using the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics for the AdWords advertisers who have opted for conversion tracking. Customers are told the total number of users who clicked on their ad and were redirected to a conversion tracking tag page. However, advertisers do not obtain any information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt-out of this by disabling the Google Conversion Tracking cookie in your browser settings. By doing so, you will not be included in the conversion tracking statistics.</p>
			<p>Conversion cookies are stored based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
			<p>For more information about Google AdWords and Google Conversion Tracking, see the Google Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a>.</p>
			<p>You can configure your browser to inform you about the use of cookies so that you can decide on a case-by-case basis whether to accept or reject a cookie. Alternatively, your browser can be configured to automatically accept cookies under certain conditions or to always reject them, or to automatically delete cookies when closing your browser. Disabling cookies may limit the functionality of this website.</p>
			<h4>Google reCAPTCHA</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby webpages may use "Google reCAPTCHA.". This service is operated by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA ("Google").</p>
			<p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether the data entered on our website (such as on a contact form) has been entered by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For the analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g. IP address, how long the visitor has been on the website, or mouse movements made by the user). The data collected during the analysis will be forwarded to Google.</p>
			<p>The reCAPTCHA analyses take place completely in the background. Website visitors are not advised that such an analysis is taking place.</p>
			<p>Data processing is based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its site from abusive automated crawling and spam.</p>
			<p>For more information about Google reCAPTCHA and Google's privacy policy, please visit the following links: <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">www.google.com/intl/de/policies/privacy/</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html" target="_blank">www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/android.html</a>.</p>
			<h4>Facebook Web Beacon</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby webpages may measure conversions using visitor action web beacons from Facebook, which is located at Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.</p>
			<p>The Facebook web beacon allows the behavior of site visitors to be tracked after they click on a Facebook ad to reach the provider's website. This allows an analysis of the effectiveness of Facebook advertisements for statistical and market research purposes and their future optimization.</p>
			<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by Facebook, which may make a connection to your Facebook profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the Facebook privacy policy. This will allow Facebook to display ads both on Facebook and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.<br>
			Conversion web beacons are used based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
			<p>Check out Facebook's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also deactivate the custom audiences remarketing feature in the Ads Settings section at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/ads/preferences/</a>. You will first need to log into Facebook.</p>
			<p>If you do not have a Facebook account, you can opt out of usage-based advertising from Facebook on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>.</p>
			<h4>BazaarVoice Web Beacon</h4>
			<p>Some Horizon Hobby webpages may measure conversions using visitor action web beacons from BazaarVoice, which is located at BazaarVoice, Inc., 10901 Stonelake Blvd., Austin, TX 78759, USA ("BazaarVoice").</p>
			<p>The data collected is anonymous to us as operators of this website and we cannot use it to draw any conclusions about our users' identities. However, the data are stored and processed by BazaarVoice, which may make a connection to your BazaarVoice profile and which may use the data for its own advertising purposes, as stipulated in the BazaarVoice privacy policy. This will allow BazaarVoice to display ads both on BazaarVoice and on third-party sites. We have no control over how this data is used.</p>
			<p>Conversion web beacons are used based on GDPR Art. 6(1)(f). The website operator has a legitimate interest in analyzing user behavior to optimize both its website and its advertising.</p>
			<p>Check out BazaarVoice's privacy policy to learn more about protecting your privacy: <a href="https://www.bazaarvoice.com/legal/privacy-policy/" target="_blank">www.bazaarvoice.com/legal/privacy-policy/</a>.</p>
			<p>You can also opt out of data use by BazaarVoice by visiting their privacy policy webpage and selecting the "Opt Out" button in the Opting Out section.</p>
			<p>If located in the European Union, you can also opt out of usage-based advertising from BazaarVoice on the website of the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance: <a href="https://www.youronlinechoices.com" target="_blank">www.youronlinechoices.com</a>. If located in the United States, you can opt out from BazaarVoice on the Preferences Manager website of Truste: <a href="https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/" target="_blank">https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/</a>.</p>

		<h2>5. Newsletters</h2>
		<p>If you would like to receive our newsletter, we require a valid email address as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and that you agree to receive this newsletter. No additional data is collected or is only collected on a voluntary basis. We only use this data to send the requested information and do not pass it on to third parties.<br>
		We will, therefore, process any data you enter onto the contact form only with your consent under GDPR Art. 6 (1)(a). You can revoke consent to the storage of your data and email address as well as their use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g. through the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter.

			<p>If you do not want your usage of the newsletter to be analyzed by us, you will have to unsubscribe from the newsletter. For this purpose, we provide a link in every newsletter we send. You can also unsubscribe from the newsletter directly on the website.</p>
			<p>We use an email marketing system to analyze our newsletter campaigns. This allows us to determine if a newsletter message has been opened and which links you click on. We can thus find out how often various links are clicked.</p>
			<p>In addition, we can see if certain actions take place after clicking on said links (conversion rate). We can thus determine whether the clicking of a link in a newsletter has led to a purchase, for example.</p>
			<p>Our newsletter system also allows us to classify newsletter recipients into different categories (clustering). For example, newsletter recipients can be subdivided according to gender, personal preference (e.g. RC planes or RC cars), or customer relationship (e.g. existing or potential customer). This allows us to adapt the newsletters to the respective target groups.</p>
			<p>Data processing is based on GDPR Art. 6 (1)(a). You may revoke your consent at any time. The data processed before we receive your request may still be legally processed.</p>
			<p>The data provided when registering for the newsletter will be used to distribute the newsletter until you cancel your subscription when said data will be deleted from our servers. Data we have stored for other purposes (e.g. email addresses for the members area) remains unaffected.</p>
