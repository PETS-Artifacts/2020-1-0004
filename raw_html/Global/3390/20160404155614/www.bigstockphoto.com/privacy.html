<h3><a name="changes">Changes in Privacy Policy</a></h3>
<p>
    All "Personal Information" ("Personal Information" is defined as any information that identifies or can be used to
    identify, contact, or locate the person to whom such information pertains) that we collect and maintain will be
    subject to this Privacy Policy, as amended from time to time. Bigstock reserves the right to amend the Privacy
    Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice on the home page of the Site when we make
    material changes to this Privacy Policy prior to the change becoming effective. If as the result of such changes,
    you want to alter the ways in which Bigstock is allowed to use your Personal Information, you can do so by following
    the procedure described in the section entitled
    <a href="#updating">Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences</a>.
</p>
<p>
    You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, any material changes to the Privacy Policy
    after such notice has been posted with the following exception: If at the time you provide Personal Information to
    Bigstock you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how such information will be used to
    communicate with you, either by Bigstock or by third parties, Bigstock will not change your preference in this
    regard without your express consent. However, if Bigstock is acquired by or merged with another entity, Bigstock may
    provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged
    with the other entity without your consent, but Bigstock will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or
    mergers on this Site.
</p>
<h3><a name="entities">Entities Collecting Personal Information</a></h3>
<p>
    Personal Information on this Site is collected by Shutterstock, Inc. d/b/a Bigstock, Empire State Building, 350
    Fifth Avenue, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10118, USA and its telephone number is 1-866-663-3954.
</p>
<h3><a name="updating">Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences</a></h3>
<p>
    You have the right to access and correct, or delete your Personal Information and privacy preferences at any time.
    This may be accomplished by clicking on the link, <a href="/account">My Account</a>, where you can view and make
    changes to most of your Personal Information immediately. For security purposes, certain Personal Information can
    only be changed by contacting support by email. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.
</p>
<h3><a name="collection">Collection of Personal Information</a></h3>
<p>
    As a visitor to the Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any Personal Information. However,
    when you order products or services as a Bigstock customer, we may collect the following Personal Information from
    you:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and</li>
    <li>
        Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card; and
    </li>
    <li>Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type</li>
</ul>
<p>
    If you submit content to Bigstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address</li>
    <li>
        Bigstock will verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which
        will be stored on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely
        for the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored
    </li>
    <li>
        Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display
        name, skill level, content focus, etc
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some
    as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able
    to engage in that activity.
</p>
<p>
    As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Bigstock or third parties authorized by Bigstock may also
    collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its
    services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and
    the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track
    your use of the Site and its services. Bigstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns
    on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information
    with your Personal Information.
</p>
<p>
    In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on
    occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For
    example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to
    qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. As permissible, we may also supplement the information
    you provide to us with demographic and other information (such as age or interest in photography) stored in
    third-party databases in order to make it more likely that marketing communications we send will be of interest to
    you.
</p>
<h3><a name="sharing">Information Sharing with Service Providers / Agents</a></h3>
<p>
    Bigstock uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the
    best of our knowledge, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for
    any other purpose.
</p>
<p>
    We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the
    Personal Information which is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we
    may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of
    such Personal Information to the performance of services for Bigstock.
</p>
<p>
    We do not sell or otherwise provide Personal Information to other companies for the marketing of their own products
    or services.
</p>
<h3><a name="use">How Your Personal Information Is Used</a></h3>
<p>
    We do not sell, rent or share your personally identifiable information to or with third parties in any way other
    than as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Bigstock collects your information in order to record and support your
    participation in the activities you select. Bigstock or one of our trusted partners may use this information to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Process your financial transactions</li>
    <li>Send you order / renewal confirmations</li>
    <li>
        Register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered
        users
    </li>
    <li>Respond to customer service requests, questions and concerns</li>
    <li>Administer your account</li>
    <li>Send you requested product or service information</li>
    <li>Keep you informed about special offers and services of Bigstock and selected third parties</li>
    <li>Administer promotions and sweepstakes you enter and notify you of the results</li>
    <li>Investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities and/or violations of our Terms of Service</li>
    <li>
        Meet our research and product/service development needs and to improve our Site, services and offerings; and
    </li>
    <li>Customize your experience, including targeting our services and offerings to you</li>
</ul>
<p>
    We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, transparent images, and/or third party sources to
    create a summary of your preferences. We tie your personally identifiable information, and/or your membership usage
    history, to information in the summary, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers, to improve the
    content of the site for you and/or to determine your preferences.
</p>
<p>
    We further reserve the right to disclose your Personal Information as required by law (e.g., to comply with a
    subpoena, warrant, court order, or legal process served on Bigstock ) and when we believe that disclosure is
    necessary to protect our rights, avoid litigation, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud,
    and/or respond to a government request. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such
    disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.
</p>
<h3><a name="data-retention">Data Retention</a></h3>
<p>
    We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.
    If you wish to delete your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact
    us at <a href="mailto:Support@Bigstockphoto.com">Support@Bigstockphoto.com</a>. We will respond to your request
    within 30 days. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve
    disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>
<p>
    You may "opt out" of receiving Bigstock's email updates, newsletters and/or partner emails by clicking on the

<h3><a name="data-protection">Protection of Your Personal Information</a></h3>
<p>
    The Personal Information that you provide in connection with the use of the Site is protected in several ways.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Access by you to your account profile is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you.

        divulge to anyone
    </li>
    <li>
        Your Personal Information resides on a secure server that only selected Bigstock personnel and contractors have
        access to via password
    </li>
    <li>Your Personal Information is encrypted whenever it is transmitted to Bigstock</li>
