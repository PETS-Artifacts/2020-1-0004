            Transaction History FAQs</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>How often are updates posted to the online transaction history?</strong></p>
        <p>
            Our system is updated at the end of each business day and will appear on your history<br /> 
			the following business day.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>Why isn't the information updated instantly in your system?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The technology we use to transmit a day's worth of account updates as a single "batch"<br /> 
			is more reliable and more secure than transmitting each update individually.</p>
		<p>
            <strong>Why doesn't my online transaction history show my last payment?</strong></p>
		<p>
            It often takes several days to receive and process a payment. Once the payment is<br /> 
		    reflected in our system, it will appear in your transaction history on the next business day.<br /> 
		    This will not be the case if you are viewing your online current statement.</p>
