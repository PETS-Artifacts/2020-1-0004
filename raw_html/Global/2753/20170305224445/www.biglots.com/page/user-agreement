<h3>IV. ORDERS</h3>

<div id="acceptanceandbilling">
<p><strong>A. Acceptance and Billing.</strong> All billing information provided must be truthful and accurate. YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO USE ANY CREDIT CARD(S) OR OTHER PAYMENT METHOD(S) UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ORDER. By submitting such information, you grant to Big Lots the right to provide such information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of orders initiated by you or on your behalf. Providing any false, untruthful or inaccurate information constitutes a breach of this Agreement for which we may cancel your order. Before accepting an order we may request additional information from you. We may refuse or cancel an order for any reason including limitations on the quantities available, inaccuracies or errors in product or pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and fraud avoidance partners. If your order is canceled after your credit card (or other payment account) has been charged, we will issue a credit to your credit card (or other applicable payment account) in the amount of the charge. We will contact you if all or any portion of your order is canceled or if additional information is required to accept your order. Big Lots may request a pre-authorization for some orders placed online with a credit or debit card. This pre-authorization will not be billed to you; however, your card issuer may hold this amount for a short period. Your card issuer determines the length of time the pre-authorization is held. We do this to ensure that the card details are still valid and that you have sufficient funds to complete the transaction.</p>

<p>By confirming your purchase during the checkout process, you agree to accept and pay for the item(s). You will not be charged for most orders until the order ships. You will be charged at the time your order is placed for: (1) orders or preorders paid for with a Gift Card, eGift Card or PayPal account; and (2) any orders paid using the in-store &quot;Cash&quot; payment method.</p>

<p>Big Lots reserves the right to limit the quantity of items purchased per person, per household or per order for any reason. These restrictions may apply to orders placed by the same account, the same credit card, and also to orders that use the same billing and/or shipping address. If such limits are applied, we will notify you. Big Lots also reserves the right, at our sole discretion, to prohibit sales to dealers or resellers of any kind.</p>
</div>

<div id="pricingandtaxinformation">
<p><strong>B. Pricing and Tax Information.</strong> Big Lots cannot confirm the final price of an item (including any estimated tax or other charges) until after your order is placed. You may access up-to-date order information by visiting <a href="http://www.biglots.com/orders">www.biglots.com/orders</a>. Any applicable taxes, tax reimbursements or other applicable government fees or impositions are charged or collected for orders shipped to the U.S. The amount of any such charges is based on current rates. The sales tax rate applied to your order will generally be at the combined state and local rate for the address where your order is shipped. Estimated tax displayed during your order and on your packing slip is only an estimate, as many factors can change between the time you place your order and when your order ships. The actual amount of tax, government fees or impositions Big Lots collects may be different than the amount shown when you placed your order or on your packing slip, as such actual amount is not calculated until the time of shipment. Gift-wrap and delivery or shipping charges may also be subject to collection of tax, government fees or impositions in applicable jurisdictions. The applicable tax, government fees or impositions will be refunded for returned items, in accordance with applicable state laws. Gift Cards purchased at BigLots.com or at a Big Lots store are not taxable (but purchases made with gift cards may be subject to taxes, tax reimbursements, or other government fees or impositions). Government laws and rates are subject to change at any time. Certain purchases may be made while a tax-free event is effective (e.g. sales tax holiday). Eligibility and participation may vary, so visit the applicable jurisdiction&#39;s website for complete details. If you are not charged sales tax on a purchase made via the Service, you may owe &quot;use tax&quot; to your state of residency.</p>

<p>SHIPMENTS TO A SOUTH DAKOTA ADDRESS: YOU MAY OWE USE TAX DIRECTLY TO THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA. In regards to merchandise purchased on Service and shipped to South Dakota, you should be aware that, unless your purchase is specifically excluded from South Dakota sales tax, South Dakota law requires each South Dakota purchaser to report any purchase that was not taxed and to pay applicable taxes on the purchase. The tax may be reported and paid on the South Dakota use tax form. The use tax form and related instructions are available on the South Dakota Department of Revenue website. This notice is required for South Dakota delivered purchases based on Senate Bill No. 146.</p>

<p>Pricing errors may occur on the Service from time to time. Big Lots reserves the right to cancel any orders containing pricing errors, with no further obligations to you, even after your receipt of an order confirmation or shipping notice from Big Lots. Big Lots may, at its discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Pricing for products may be different on the Service or from prices available in Big Lots stores or on Big Lots mobile applications (pricing and availability remain subject to confirmation at checkout for mobile users). It is also important to note that the Service may, in our sole discretion, offer a price match for identical merchandise sold in our stores or by other online retailers that also maintain brick-and-mortar store locations. See our complete <a href="http://www.biglots.com/page/price-promise">Price Match Policy</a> for details, the terms of which are incorporated herein and made a part of this Agreement.</p>

<h3>V. INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS</h3>

<div id="procedureforallegingcopyrightinfringement">
<p><strong>A. Procedure for Alleging Copyright Infringement.</strong> We respect the intellectual property of others. We will promptly process and investigate notices of alleged copyright infringement by third parties and will take necessary action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, Title 17, United States Code, Section 512(c)(2) <strong>(&quot;DMCA&quot;)</strong>, where appropriate, in accordance with our DMCA policy.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the DMCA, a notification of alleged copyright infringement by a third party should be sent to our designated agent. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been infringed under U.S. copyright law and is accessible on the Service, please notify us by contacting our designated agent. Even if you believe that the alleged infringing work was not posted by a third party, please send all notifications of alleged copyright infringement to Big Lots&#39; designated agent listed below.</p>

<p>To be effective under the DMCA, a notice of alleged copyright infringement by third parties must be a written communication to our designated agent that includes the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed;</li>
	<li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>
	<li>Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material;</li>
	<li>Information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number and, if available, an e-mail address at which the complaining party may be contacted;</li>
	<li>A statement that the complaining party has a good-faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law; and</li>
	<li>A statement that the information in the notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our designated agent for notice of claims of copyright infringement can be reached as follows:</p>
<span>By Mail:</span>

<p style="margin: 0">Big Lots Stores, Inc.</p>

<p style="margin: 0">Attn: Office of the General Counsel (Copyright Infringement Claim)</p>

<p style="margin: 0">300 Phillipi Road</p>

<p style="margin: 0">Columbus, Ohio 43228</p>

<p style="margin: 0">Telephone: 1-866-BIG-LOTS (244-5687)</p>

<p>This contact information is only for reporting claims of copyright infringement. Contact information for other matters is provided elsewhere in this Agreement.</p>

<p>Upon receipt of a valid notification of alleged copyright infringement by a third party, Big Lots will remove or disable access to the material identified in the notice, forward the written notification to the alleged infringer, and take reasonable efforts to notify the alleged infringer that it has removed or disabled access to this material. Big Lots reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to remove or disable access to the Service to any user at any time, including repeat alleged-infringers.</p>

<p>Be aware that, under the DMCA, claimants who make misrepresentations concerning copyright infringement may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys&#39; fees, incurred by the alleged infringer or by Big Lots, if injured by relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing.</p>

<p>If a notice of copyright infringement has been filed against you, you may file a counter notification with the designated agent at the address listed above.</p>

<p>To be effective, a counter notification must be a written communication provided to the Big Lots&#39; designated agent that includes the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A physical or electronic signature;</li>
	<li>Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;</li>
	<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and</li>
	<li>Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located and that you will accept service of process from the complainant who provided the original notification or an agent of such person or entity.</li>
</ol>

<p>If we receive a valid counter notification, we will provide the complainant with a copy of the counter notification, inform the complainant that we will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 to 14 business days from receipt of the counter notification, and replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 to 14 business days, provided that we have not received notice from the complainant that an action has been filed seeking a court order to restrain the alleged infringer from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system.</p>

<p>You should be aware that the DMCA provides substantial penalties for a false counter notice filed in response to a notice of copyright infringement. Claimants who make misrepresentations in their the counter notification statement may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys&#39; fees, incurred by any copyright owner or copyright owner&#39;s authorized licensee, or by Big Lots, if injured by relying upon such misrepresentation in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.</p>
</div>

<div id="procedureforalleginginfringementofotherintellectualproperty">
<p><strong>B. Procedure for Alleging Infringement of Other Intellectual Property.</strong> If you own intellectual property other than copyrights and believe that your intellectual property has been infringed by an improper posting or distribution of it via the Service, then you may send Big Lots a written notice to the addresses set forth above that includes all of the following:</p>

<ol type="1">
	<li>a legend or subject line that says: &quot;Intellectual Property Infringement Notice&quot;;</li>
	<li>a description of the intellectual property that you claim has been infringed;</li>
	<li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing or is the subject of infringing activity is located that is reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the material (please include the URL of the Service on which the material appears);</li>
	<li>your full name, address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
	<li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the owner of the intellectual property, its agent, or the law;</li>
	<li>a statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that all the information in your notice is accurate, and that you are the owner of the intellectual property at issue (or, if you are not the owner, then your statement must indicate that you are authorized to act on the behalf of the owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly infringed); and</li>
	<li>your electronic or physical signature.</li>
</ol>

<p>Big Lots will act on such notices in our sole discretion. Any user of the Service that fails to respond satisfactorily to Big Lots with regard to any such notice is subject to suspension or termination. Big Lots may send the information that you provide in your notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing material.</p>

The arbitration will be conducted based on written submissions unless you request a phone or in-person hearing, or the arbitrator determines that a phone or in-person hearing is necessary. The arbitrator may only award those damages and relief as a court could, and must follow the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Dispute Agreement.</p>
