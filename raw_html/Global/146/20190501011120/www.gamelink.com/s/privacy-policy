				<u>Your Data is Important</u>
			</b>: It is important to note that, as an eCommerce site, we do collect, use and store data in order to deliver the goods and services you request from us.

To comply with this legislation (known as GDPR), we are making a variety of updates to our policies and processes, but there is no change in our fundamental approach to how we use your personal data: 
			<b>we only use your data to help you find relevant products and to deliver your products.</b>

			<h3>Data Retention Policy</h3>
			<p>There are two main categories of data we are primarily concerned with: Personal Data (all of the information that identifies a particular customer (e.g. name, address, email address, etc.) and Sales Data (the purchases any customer may make). We undertake that we will not retain your personal data for periods that are longer than necessary for the purpose for which it was obtained and/or held for processing. We must, however, retain sales data for a minimum of seven years in order to comply with the requirements of various legal and financial regulatory agencies. As a result, in addition to a user's ability to export/modify/purge personal data from our system, we have a two-tiered approach to purging personal and sales data. </p>
			<p>Generally speaking, we will retain your personal data for a minimum period of three (3) years following the last day in which you interacted with us regarding the purpose for which the personal data was obtained and processed.  For example, we will retain Sales Data related to any sale for a minimum of three (3) years from the date the relevant goods or services were delivered to or, in the case of streaming video, used by you.</p>
			<p>In some cases it is not possible for us to specify in advance the periods for which your personal data will be retained. In such cases, we undertake to determine a period of retention based upon the relevant applicable statute of limitations as concerns any claim you may have as against each other based upon your interaction with the Website and/or the order or delivery of any goods or services and to attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business. </p>
			<p></p>
			<p>In any event, we may retain your personal data where retention is necessary for legal or regulatory compliance purposes or in order to protect the vital interests of either of us or of a third party.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>It is important to note that once personal data is purged either by request or our data retention policy, there will be no way for the customer or our customer service department to access any of the data or digital products stored on our servers and associated with that account. </p>
			<p></p>

			<p></p>
			<p>Your principal rights under the GDPR are access, rectification, erasure, processing restriction or objection, portability, withdrawal of consent and the right to complaint to a regulatory authority.  These rights are not absolute and exceptions apply.  For example, we may not accommodate a request to delete or change information if we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests or the change would violate any law or regulation or if retention is necessary to exercise the right of freedom of expression and information, comply with a legal obligation, attend to security issues and prevent or investigate attacks and/or fraud, maintain our record keeping, and properly administer our Website and business, to protect the vital interests of you, us, or any third party, or for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>

			<p>To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time subject to applicable exceptions. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal.</p>

			<p>If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement.</p>
