Such cookies allow us to provide a visitor’s browser with information tailored to the visitor’s preferences and needs. We also may use permanent or persistent cookies that remain on a visitor’s computer after the visitor leaves our sites. We use this data on an anonymous basis and we do not correlate this information with personal data of any user.</p>

<p>Most website browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to turn off the cookie acceptance option in your browser’s settings. However, disabling the cookie support function of the browser may prevent some portions of our sites from functioning properly, and you may not be able to utilize fully all of our sites’ features and information.

	<li>(ii) You may receive interest-based advertising on our site based on the types of sites visited from your device or other anonymous data Google has collected.</li>
	<li>(iii) To implement these tools, we and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third- party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our website and to report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.</li>
	<li>(iv) We use data from Google’s Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) to better serve you, including to improve our site, products, and services and to provide you with access to content that we believe will be of interest to you.</li>
</ul>

<p>To opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising, please use the opt-out feature in Google’s Ad Settings at <a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads/">www.google.com/settings/ads/</a>.

<p style="word-break: break-all;">We may also use one or more of the following features of Google AdWords Interest-Based Advertising features: remarketing; interest categories; similar audiences; demographic and location targeting. We follow Google’s policy for advertising based on interest and location, which you can view here: <a href="https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/143465">https://support.google.com/adwordspolicy/answer/143465</a>.</p>
