			<h4>Seven West Media Privacy Policy (Updated August 2017)</h4>
			<p><strong>About this Privacy Policy</strong></p><p>This Privacy Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information and other data is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by Seven West Media Limited and its related companies and associated entities ("<strong>Group</strong>"), including but not limited to Seven Network (Operations) Limited, Pacific Magazines Pty Limited (“<strong>Pacific</strong>”), West Australian Newspapers Limited (“<strong>WAN</strong>”) and Channel 7 Telethon Trust (“<strong>Telethon</strong>”). The Policy relates to personal information and other data collected by any means and by any technology and assumes that you are an Australian resident.</p><p>By using the Group’s websites, products or services, you consent to the Group using your personal information and other data as set olut in this Privacy Policy.  If you are under the age of 15, please provide this Privacy Policy to your parent or guardian before providing us with your personal information.</p><p>The Group also has a policy (Seven West Media’s Print and Print (Online) Privacy Policy) which applies to Pacific’s and WAN’s print and online journalism activities, and a policy (Seven West Media’s Credit Policy – Privacy) which outlines how credit information and credit eligibility information is managed by the Group.  Information regarding how the Group handles the personal information of staff is available through Human Resources. The Group treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, the Group has systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal information.</p><p>The Group abides by the Australian Privacy Principles (“<strong>APPs</strong>”), which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure, use and storage of personal information. The Group's objective is to handle information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is handled. </p><p><strong>The Privacy Act provides for exemptions:</strong></p><ol><li>in relation to employee records (being records relating to a current or former employment relationship between the Group and the individual); and</li>
<li>from coverage in relation to the journalism activities of the Group (as explained further at section 3).</li>
</ol><p>Where these exemptions apply, they will take precedence over this Policy.</p><p><strong>1.  Collection of Personal Information and other data</strong></p><p>Personal information is information or opinion about an individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable (whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form).  The nature of personal information collected by the Group comprises information such as an individual's name, address, phone number, fax, e-mail address, birth date and gender, as well as interests and information about your viewing of our programs and services, your transactions with us and with some of our business partners.</p><p>The purposes for collecting such information include to arrange, conduct and promote the Group’s media activities (including but not limited to production, broadcasting and publishing), understand our audiences and provide you with requested products and services.</p><p>The Group may collect personal information about you in a number of ways.  These include, but are not limited to situations in which you set up an account with a company within the Group (for example a magazine or newspaper subscription), request to receive products or services from the Group, provide products or services to the Group, enter a competition or voting forum, utilise the Group’s services (including, but not limited to IPTV services, websites, mobile phone apps, blogs and online forums), complete a survey or questionnaire, or when you communicate with the Group by telephone, fax, writing, email, or any other electronic means. </p><p>When you are using a service we provide to you over the internet (for example a website, mobile phone app or digital edition of one of the Group’s publications), we may use technology (including third party technology such as Google Analytics) to collect information as to your activities on such services associated with the Group including your IP Address and/or the type of operating system you use and/or the domain name of your Internet Service Provider, software and hardware attributes and the web-page you request. </p><p>In addition, the Group may set and access cookies and other similar technologies (collectively “<strong>Cookies</strong>”) on your computer or other internet-enabled device and may let other companies (such as third party tracking service providers, third party advertisers and ad network companies such as Google, Lotame and Rubicon) set and access their Cookies on your device (subject to their own privacy policies). Cookies are used to improve and personalise your experience of particular products and services, measure your use of those products and services and show you relevant advertising.  If you do not wish for data to be collected through the use of Cookies, see <a title="Privacy Policy" href="/assets/Uploads/privacy-doc6.pdf">here</a>.<a title="Privacy Policy" href="assets/Uploads/privacy-doc1.pdf" target="_blank"></a></p><p>The Group also uses third party proprietary measurement software (such as OzTAM, Nielsen and Google Analytics) on our websites and apps which enables us to collect audience ratings information and anonymous viewing data which assists us to understand how visitors engage with our websites and apps. To learn more and for information on how to opt out of such activities see <a href="/assets/Uploads/privacy-doc6.pdf">here</a>.</p><p>The Group or its agents will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, the Group may collect personal information when you subscribe to one of the Group’s publications, log on to a website or service by providing us with your email address and password, complete a survey, become a member, attend a function or event, enter a competition, make a purchase, provide a resume or enter an agreement.  There may be other occasions when the Group sources personal information from third parties, such as from Facebook or Google when you log on to a website or service using your Facebook ID or Google ID, or from recruitment agencies when you apply for a position with us via a recruitment agency. </p><p>You may choose to deal with the Group anonymously or under a pseudonym where lawful and practicable (i.e. provided we are still able to provide the relevant service or do business with you without that information).  For example, it might not be practical to deal with you anonymously if we need to process a payment, delivery goods or services or send personalised communications to you.</p><p><strong>2.
