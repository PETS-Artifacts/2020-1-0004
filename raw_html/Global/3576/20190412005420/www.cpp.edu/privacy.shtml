<h2>California Do Not Track Disclosures</h2>
<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; (DNT) browser settings.&#160; DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytic companies.&#160; We do not engage in the collection of personally identifiable information about users&#8217; online activities over time and across third party websites when an individual uses our Sites and therefore do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
<h2>How we share your information:</h2>
<p>We share your information internally at the CSU to facilitate and manage the purposes listed above, including with third parties whom the University engages to process your personal information on our behalf for the purposes stated above (such as vendors who help the University with our marketing, application processing, financial aid or payment processing, education management, and web hosting).&#160; The University may also share your personal data with government and law enforcement agencies or regulators (1) to comply with a legal process, subpoena, order or other legal or regulatory requirement applicable to us; (2) to enforce our terms of use or other policies; or (3) to pursue available legal remedies or defend against legal claims.&#160; We may also share your personal information with a third party as requested by you if permitted by this and other University policies and applicable laws and regulations.&#160; We will not distribute or share any electronically collected personal information (as defined in subdivision (d) of California Government Code section 11015.5) about users to any third party without prior written permission from the user except in narrow circumstances involving possible violations of Section 502 of the Penal Code or as authorized under law (including but not limited to the Information Practices Act), or to assist another state agency or public law enforcement organization in any case where the security of a network operated by a state agency has been, or is suspected of having been, breached.</p>
<p>We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our Sites or services for illegal activities.&#160; We may report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.&#160; Release of your personal information for security purposes, as described in this Notice to any person or entity, including, without limitation, in connection with any government investigation or litigation, shall be based on a determination made solely by us, as permitted by law or, for those not in the EEA, exercising our discretion for which you expressly grant permission to us in accordance with this Notice.</p>
<h2>How we protect your information:</h2>
<p>We take reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure.&#160; Such personal information is stored by the University in secure locations and University staff is trained on procedures for the management of personal information, including limitations on the release of information. Access to personal information is limited to those members of the University&#8217;s staff whose work requires such access.&#160; Confidential information is destroyed according to the University&#8217;s records retention schedule.&#160; The University conducts periodic reviews to ensure that proper information management policies and procedures are understood and followed.&#160;</p>
<p>The security of your personal information is important to us, but please remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.&#160; While we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to the Sites, and you do so at your own risk.&#160;Once we receive your transmission of information, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems.&#160; However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.&#160; While we strive to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online.</p>
<p>We encourage all individuals to use appropriate safeguards to secure their computers and the information on those computers.&#160; For additional information on online privacy and security, please see the University&#8217;s <a href="http://www.calstate.edu/icsuam/documents/section8000.pdf">policies and procedures related to Information Security</a>; you may also consult with the California Attorney General&#8217;s Privacy Enforcement and Protection <a href="https://livecsupomona.sharepoint.com/sites/itcompliance/Shared%20Documents/GDPR/oag.ca.gov/privacy">website</a>.</p>
<p>In the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will promptly investigate and notify those persons whose personal information has been compromised in accordance with the notification procedures set forth in the CSU Information Security Policy, or as otherwise required by applicable law.</p>
<h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
<p>We are not responsible for the practices employed by websites linked to or from our Sites nor the information or content contained in them, and we make no warranty, either express or implied, concerning the content of any such site, including the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or suitability of them for any particular purpose, nor do we warrant that any such site or content is free from any claims of copyright, trademark, or other infringement of the rights of third parties, or that any such site or content is devoid of viruses or other contamination.&#160; We may provide links to other websites to you solely as a convenience, and the inclusion of linked sites does not imply endorsement by the University or CSU of any of the linked sites.&#160; Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Sites to another website, our Notice is no longer in effect.&#160; Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a link on our Sites, is subject to that website&#8217;s own rules and policies.&#160;Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.&#160; We do not ensure the security of your personal information if you visit websites not belonging to CSU, nor are we the data controller for any information collected on those sites unless we specifically state so.&#160; We further reserve the right to terminate a link to a third party site at any time.</p>
<h2>Access and choice:</h2>
<p>We comply with all applicable regulations regarding data retention and deletion of personal data and retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected (including for college operations), for strategic planning, and to comply with applicable laws and retention requirements.&#160; You can ask to review, update or make changes to the personal information we maintain about you, or exercise your option of having your personal information discarded without reuse or distribution, by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below.&#160; We may take a reasonable period of time to respond.&#160;If you request the deactivation or change of information on our system, such information may be retained in our backup systems for a period of time subject to technology restrictions, or as a precaution against systems failures.&#160; Some information may be retained for longer periods as required by law, contract or auditing requirements or as otherwise described in this Notice.</p>

<p>You can choose not to receive such emails from us by &#8220;unsubscribing&#8221; using the instructions in any email you receive from us, or by sending a written request to the postal or email address set out below. &#160;It may take up to thirty (30) business days for us to process your request. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account or your transactions with us, or any other service-related email. &#160;Opting out does not affect our communications with you via telephone or mail nor does it affect our use of your non-personally identifiable information as described in this Notice.</p>
