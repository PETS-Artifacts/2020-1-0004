It describes:</dd><ul><li>what information we collect about you;</li><li>how we use your information;</li><li>who we share your information with;</li><li>collection and use of Non-Personal Data;</li><li>your rights regarding our use of your information; </li><li>how long we keep your information; and</li><li>how to contact us.</li></ul><dd>We provide this Privacy Policy to help you understand how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information that we access in order to provide our “Services”. When we say Services in this Privacy Policy, we mean our websites located at <span class='underline'>http://www.wps.com</span>, <span class='underline'>http://note.wps.com/</span> and other websites operated by us through which our Services are provided  (“<b>Sites</b>”), our mobile device applications (“<b>Apps</b>”),  and our software products available for use via the Apps or via installation on windows personal computers (collectively, the “<b>Products</b>”). This Privacy Policy applies to only those websites, products, services and applications included within the “<b>Services</b>” and does not apply to any third-party websites, products, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.</dd><dt>Revision to this Privacy Policy</dt><dd>Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time in accordance with the law. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you of such changes by posting them on our websites or by sending you emails or other notifications, and we will update the Last Updated Date above to indicate when such changes became effective.</dd><dt>What Information We Collect about You</dt><dd>Your information is the data relating to you, which can be used to identify you directly or indirectly. We collect and process your information to provide and improve our Services for you, to administer your use of our Services, and to enable you to enjoy and easily navigate our Services. We will be transparent about the collection and use of your information so that you can make informed decisions. You are not required to provide us with the information that we have requested, but if you choose not to do so, in many cases we will not be able to provide you with our Products and Services or to respond to any queries you may have.</dd><dd>We collect the following information about you:</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Basic Subscription Information</span>. If you create an account in connection with your use of any of the Services (“<b>Account</b>” or “<b>WPS ID</b>”), either through our Sites or when you download and install our Products, we’ll collect certain information about you, such as your name, email address, postal address, phone number and credit card information (“<b>PII</b>”). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your accounts with certain third-party social networking services such as Google, Facebook or Twitter (each, an “<b>SNS Account</b>”), we’ll be able to access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account, we may also collect other information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Collected Using Cookies and Other Web Technologies</span>. Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain information.</dd><dd>“<b>Cookies</b>” are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage and Web traffic routing on our Services, and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on your hard drive on the basis of related arrangement. Please note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies but not use of Cookies by such third parties.</dd><dd>“<b>Web Beacons</b>” (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies which are stored on the user’s hard drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on Web pages (or in an e-mail).</dd><dd>At the same time, our Services may include third-party tracking tools without limitation to individual cookies, APIs (application programming interface) and SDKs (software development kit) which belong to part of the third-party services providers on behalf of Kingsoft to collect and analyze technical data from you. Kingsoft or aforementioned third-party services providers on behalf of Kingsoft collect such data not to identify any specific individuality or personality of yours but to understand how you access and use the Services at general manner. Such data helps us provide the Services for you, learn how the Services are used, and make the Services more useful to you. The technical data collected by Kingsoft and the aforementioned third-party services providers may include:</dd><ul><li>Your devices or software data, such as your Internet Protocol (“<b>IP</b>”) address, device identifier, region and language settings, network settings and status, operating system, device storage, Android ID and HDID, browser or other software used to connect our Services;</li><li>Your operation data, such as the aggregate number of time, frequency and activity of your use of our Services, and when you use contact management functions or interact with other persons or institutions through our Services, we may collect data relating to your contacts and your relationship with such contacts;</li><li>The metadata shared by you, such as shooting, uploaded sharing photos or videos, as well as exact date, time, place, and other data stored when using our Services.</li></ul><dd><span class='underline'>Information Related to Use of the Services</span>. Our servers automatically record certain data about how a person uses our Services (“<b>Log Data</b>”), including that of both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a “<b>User</b>”). Log Data may include certain data such as a User’s IP address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding and tailoring features and functionalities of our Services to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-identifying data about where our Services are used. In addition, for the aforementioned purposes and providing better access to and experience of our Services for you, we may allow certain third parties to collect and use your information.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Sent by Your Mobile Device</span>. We may collect certain data sent by your mobile device when you use our Services, such as a device identifier, the number and type of your devices you use to connect to the Service, user settings, device storage, Android ID, HDID and the operating system of your devices (e.g., iOS, Android etc.), as well as data relating to your use of our Services.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Location Data</span>. When you use our Services, our third party services providers (such as Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook Analytics, Umeng, Flurry etc.) may collect and provide us with your location data by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location. We may use such location data to improve and personalize our Services for you.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Received from Our Partners and Other Third Parties</span>. We also may link your subscription information with the data information we receive from our partners or other third parties ( such as Google Analytics, Firebase, Facebook Analytics, Umeng, Flurry etc.) to help smoothly facilitate our Services for you, to better understand your needs and to provide you with better Services experience.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Contact Information for Technical Support</span>. We also may record your email, telephone and dialogue contents when you contact us for service support by sending emails or calling, to help us keep contact with you for updates and support to resolve your queries for use of our Services.</dd><dt>How We Use Your Information</dt><dd>We are committed to protecting the privacy of your information. We use your information:</dd><ol><li>To enter and perform a contract with you to provide the Services, or to perform any steps you require from us before entering into a contract to provide the Services.</li><li>To pursue our legitimate interests, which include:<div class="span">(a) Helping us understand how you access and use our Services, in order to improve our existing Services and develop our new Services for you. This may include: (i) testing and applying new product or system versions, patches, updates and upgrades; (ii) monitoring and testing system use and performance; and (iii) resolving bugs and other issues you have reported to Kingsoft. Any copies of Services data created for these purposes are only maintained for time periods relevant to those purposes.</div><div class="span">(b) Providing troubleshooting, customer support, identity authentication and protecting the security of our Services;</div><div class="span">(c) Carrying out fraud detection, archiving and backup in connection with the provision of our Services;</div><div class="span">(d) Improving customer communications and ensuring that we provide secure, quality Services to our customers;</div><div class="span">(e) Contacting you and sending you information about: (i) products and Services or advertisements that may be of interest; and (ii) assessing the effectiveness of and improving advertising and other marketing and promotional activities on or in connection with our Services when your account is subscribed to an official account. If you don't want to receive such information, you can opt out at any time.</div><div class="span">(f) Allowing you to participate in surveys about our Products and Services. If you participate in a survey, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys is voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose such information. We may use a third-party services provider to conduct these surveys and such third-party services provider will be prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</div></li><li>To comply with our legal obligations and establish, exercise or defend our legal rights.</li><li>For other purposes which you give your consent and/or of which we have informed you.</li></ol><dd><b>Please note that for your better experience through our services and the improvement of our Services, with your explicit consent, your information collected through our Services may, subject to this Privacy Policy, be reasonably used for the provision of our other Services (including in an aggregated or individualized manner provided by or cooperated with any third party).</b></dd><dt>Collection and Use of Non-Personal Data</dt><dd>“Non-Personal Data” is the data that cannot be used to identify you. We collect Non-Personal Data to understand how people use our Products and Services and to help us improve our Services to better satisfy customer needs. We may, at our own discretion, collect, use, process, transfer or disclose Non-Personal Data for other purposes as well.</dd><dd>We will keep your information and Non-Personal Data separate and use each independently. If we do combine Non-Personal Data with your information, the combined data will be treated as personal data. We will protect the privacy of your information through strong security and encryption and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</dd><dt>Who We Share Your Information with</dt><dd>We will not share any information that we have collected from or about you except as described below and we will share only necessary information on the minimum basis:</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Shared with Our Services Providers</span>. We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services. For example, we work with third party services providers to assist with credit card processing services and customer management systems. Such third-party services providers will have access to your PII for the purpose of performing certain services on our behalf.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions</span>. Information that we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be business assets of ours. Thus, if we are engaged with a third party in a transaction such as merger, acquisition or sales of assets or if our assets are acquired by a third party in the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your information, may be disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with such transaction.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Information Required by Law</span>. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable.</dd><dd><span class='underline'>Other Data Shared with Third Parties</span>. We may share aggregated data and non-personal data with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar purposes.</dd><dd>In addition we may share your information with companies in the same group as us, as well as other third parties with your informed consent.</dd><dt>Transnational Data Transfer</dt><dd>It may be necessary for us to transfer your information to any third party affiliated to us or with whom we have a cooperative relationship, and such information may be maintained on computers and/or other servers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in whole or in part where the privacy laws and technology level may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction (“<b>Cross-border Transmission of Information</b>”). If you want to know more about such Cross-border Transmissions of Information, please send your e-mail to privacy@wps.com. We will duly handle your response but please note that our Services may not be available to you if you refuse Cross-border Transmission of Information.</dd><dd>We comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework (“<b>Framework</b>”) regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data. When you and Kingsoft have agreed by contract that your information from the European Economic Area (“<b>EEA</b>”) or Switzerland will be transferred and processed pursuant to the Privacy Shield for the relevant services, for conducting these activities on behalf of EEA or Swiss customers, we will hold and process your information provided by the EEA or Swiss customer at the direction of the customer with discretion under the Framework. We will then be responsible for ensuring that third parties acting as an agent on our behalf do the same.</dd><dt>Your Rights in relation to Our Use of Your Information</dt><dd>You have rights under data protection law in relation to our use of your information, including to:</dd><ul><li>Request access to your information, which you can do using this from privacy@wps.com;</li><li>Update or amend your information if it is inaccurate or incomplete;</li><li>Object to certain use of your information (which includes direct marketing, processing based on legitimate interests, and processing for purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics) on grounds relating to your particular situation;</li><li>Request the deletion of your information, or restrict its use, in certain circumstances (for example you can request that we erase your information where the information is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected unless certain exceptions apply);</li><li>Withdraw any consent you have provided in respect of our use of your information;</li><li>Request us to return the information you have provided to us, to use for your own purposes (often called your right to data portability) where the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract, and such processing is carried out by automated means; and</li><li>Lodge a complaint with the relevant supervisory authority.</li></ul><dd>You can exercise your right to access, update and delete your information either on your Apps and Products, or you could contact us and we will assist you to exercise your right.
