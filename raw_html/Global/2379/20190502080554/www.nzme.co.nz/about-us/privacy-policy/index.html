            <h2>NZME Privacy Statement <a name="top"></a></h2>
<p>At NZME we value the communities that gather around our brands and take pride in bringing you premium content worthy of your attention. It’s important to us that whatever we are bringing you, whether it’s the latest news, hit music or in-depth conversation, it’s what you want and its meaningful to you. But to give you more of what you want we need to understand you. This means, with your permission, using the information that you give us to make sure our products and services are on point.</p>
<p>We understand how important your personal information is and that we need to earn your trust, by being honest and transparent about what we do. It’s our job to ensure you really understand what information we collect from you, how we use it and how we keep it safe. We take our commitment to your privacy seriously.</p>
<p>We are committed to complying with privacy laws and standards. For information about the New Zealand Privacy Act 1993 and how it protects all personal information in New Zealand, <a href="https://www.privacy.org.nz/the-privacy-act-and-codes/privacy-act-and-codes-introduction/" target="_blank">click here</a>.</p>
<p>To make it easy and clear for everyone, we’ve simplified our Privacy Policy language. No more jargon. It’s now straightforward and to the point.</p>
<h2>NZME Privacy Policy <a name="top"></a></h2>
<p>In this Privacy Policy we (meaning NZME Limited and its related companies) aim to answer your questions about privacy and personal data use at NZME:</p>

<p><a href="#shareinfo">- Who does NZME share my information with?</a></p>
<p><a href="#useinfo">- How might NZME use my information?</a></p>
<p><a href="#partners">- What happens if I interact with any of NZME’s content providers, advertisers or partners?</a></p>
<p><a href="#cookies">- How does NZME use cookies and similar tracking technologies?</a></p>
<p><a href="#control">- How can I control the personal information NZME collects from me?</a></p>
<p><a href="#safe">- How can I find out what personal information NZME holds and how can I update it or request      deletion?</a></p>
<p><a href="#changepolicy">- Can NZME make changes to this policy? How will I find out?</a></p>
<p><em>If you have any other questions about our approach to privacy and personal data use please feel free to contact us by <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2841464e47684652454d064b47064652" target="_blank">email</a> or by mail to NZME, 2 Graham Street, Private Bag 92198, Victoria St West, Auckland 1142, New Zealand.<br /><br /></em></p>
<p><a name="kindinfo"></a></p>
<h2>What kinds of information does NZME collect?</h2>
<p>We gather information for many reasons but ultimately it allows us to develop, tailor and deliver our services, and inform our marketing and advertising.  We will not collect personal information unless it is for a lawful purpose that is connected with one of our functions or activities, and having that information is necessary for that purpose.</p>
<p>The information we gather includes the following types of information about our users, including you: </p>
<p>1. Personal information provided by you when you interact with us or if you link, connect, or log in to your account with a third-party service (e.g. Facebook). This may be when you use or purchase our products or services, when you subscribe or register to use our products or services, when you agree to a background or credit check, when you communicate with us including when you call us, when you post information on discussion boards or comment publicly on our articles, and when you provide us with your feedback or respond to surveys you are asked to participate in. </p>
<p>2. General location information (e.g. your physical or postal address or your device’s IP address) or more specific location information (e.g. precise location from your mobile GPS) when you use certain features of our services. Your mobile device may allow you to control or disable the use of location services in your device’s settings menu.</p>
<p>3. Additional information about you that is publicly available (e.g. we may collect your property information held by local councils).</p>
<p>4. Aggregated information generated by our systems or third party systems we use, which track traffic to and from our sites but does not relate to you personally (this information is generally anonymised, but may include the device, applications or operating system you’re using, your IP address, and your geo-demographic information). </p>
<p>5. Other information that does not personally identify you. </p>
<p>If you choose not to provide personal information that we need from you this may mean some of our products or services will not be available to you or function in the same way. </p>
<p>We will not collect information about any person that we know to be under the age of 13. Nor will we collect special categories of personal information, such as information about your race, political opinions, religion, health or sexual orientation, unless you have chosen to provide that information to us.</p>

<p><a href="/about-us/privacy-policy/">Back to top<br /><br /></a></p>
<h2>Who does NZME share my information with?</h2>
<p> We may need to share or disclose:</p>
<p>1. information that we gather, including your personal information, with our related companies. These are the companies partly or fully owned by NZME and their use of the information remains governed by this privacy policy.</p>
<p>2. some of your personal information to our third party service providers so they can help us provide and manage our services (e.g. they help us with service functionality, customer service, billing and invoicing, and conducting research and analysis). We will limit their access to your personal information so they only have what is necessary to perform the tasks we ask of them, and we take steps to ensure they use your personal information consistently with this privacy policy.</p>
<p>3. aggregated tracking information (that is information about our users that we anonymise and combine so that it no longer identifies any individual user) and other information that does not personally identify you to third parties (such as our advertisers and partners) for business purposes such as helping with market analysis, audience profiling, marketing and advertising.</p>
<p>4. non-personal information such as hashed data, click stream information, browser type, and information about your interactions with advertisements which is generated through the use of cookies, beacons, and similar technologies and collected by third parties when you use our services. This information may be combined with other information collected from different websites or online services, and other linked or connected devices. These third parties may use such non-personal information to improve their own services and consistent with their own privacy policies. Please see our section on cookies below for more information.</p>
<p>5. your personal information to third parties when we believe in good faith that we are required to do so by law.</p>
<p>7. your personal information to other third parties provided we have your prior authorisation, which we will usually obtain at the time of collecting the information from you or when you later authorise us to share it. </p>
<p>A list of third parties who may be provided with information, and a description of how those third parties may use this information, can be found <a href="/about-us/privacy-policy/third-party-access-to-information/">here.<br /><br /></a></p>

<h2><span>How does NZME use Cookies and similar tracking technologies?<br /></span></h2>
<p><a name="cookies"></a></p>
<p>Why does NZME use cookies?</p>
<p> We use cookies (and other tools which perform similar functions, like beacons, and local storage)to gather and store information about your use of our services. These tools do not identify you directly but the information collected will be linked to a unique user identifier code that is assigned to you. This allows us to use the information collected by the tools to understand more about your viewing habits and interests, and helps us to deliver our services to you.</p>
<p>How is cookie information used?</p>
<p>We may use the information generated by cookies or similar tools to:</p>
<p>1. track traffic patterns to and from and across our sites such as the pages you visit, the time you spend on each page, the date and time of your visit, and referring pages (pages you came from or go to);</p>
<p>2. ensure advertising is being shown to the most appropriate person based on this data and limit the frequency of display for certain ad formats; and</p>
<p>3. enable you to use certain services as a member without having to log on each time and to visit member-restricted areas of the site. </p>
<p>We may also use online measurement companies and other service providers to analyse our cookie information and help us manage and optimise our digital businesses and communications. These companies take information about visits to our sites to assist us with analysing the site's performance and the effectiveness of advertising so we can optimise our services for users and advertisers.
