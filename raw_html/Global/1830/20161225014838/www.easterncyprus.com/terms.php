					<p>
					<b>This is a copy of the current Membership Terms agreed to when registering:</b><br><br>

					While the administrators and moderators of this forum will attempt to remove or edit any generally objectionable material as quickly as possible, we do not actively monitor the content of postings and therefore it is impossible to review every message. Therefore you acknowledge that all posts made to these forums express the views/opinions of the author and not the administrator, moderators or webmaster (except for posts by these people) and hence will not be held liable. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, or any user of the forums, are those of the respective author(s). You acknowledge and agree that you use and/or rely on any information obtained through this forum at your own risk. Further legal information about posting can be found <a href="http://easterncyprus.com/viewtopic.php?t=7499" target="_blank">Here</a>.<br><br>

					You agree not to post any false, abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, hateful, threatening, invasive of a persons privacy, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws. In addition you agree not to send via email or make any posting that contains abusive, insulting, threatening or bullying language to any other member. Doing so may lead to you being suspended or immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being informed).<br><br>
	
					People who have had their accounts suspended or terminated are prohibited from opening new accounts. 
					You are entitled to open ONE membership account only for your sole use - the opening of multiple accounts for the purposes of advertising or causing disruption on the forum will lead to all accounts being suspended or permanently revoked. You are solely responsible for the operation and security of your membership account.<br><br>

					The IP address of all posts is recorded to aid in enforcing these conditions. The use of any IP sharing/masking software such as proxy, VPN, ToR etc during the registration process will likely result in delays and/or your application being denied. <br><br>

					You agree that the webmaster, administrator and moderators of this forum have the right to remove, edit, move or close any topic at any time should they see fit. Members who are consistently disruptive to the smooth running of the forum may have their posting or membership rights revoked. Any questions regarding the operation of the forum should be emailed direct to a Mod or Admin.<br><br>

					<b>Advertising posts are not permitted on the forum, in any form, unless you are a Forum Sponsor.</b><br><br>

					As a user you agree to any information you have entered above being stored in a database. While this information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent the webmaster, administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt that may lead to the data being compromised.<br><br>

					This forum system uses cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do not contain any of the information you have entered above; they serve only to improve your viewing pleasure. The e-mail address is used only for confirming your registration details and password (and for sending new passwords should you forget your current one) please ensure that it is valid and working. As we require a valid and working email address the use of disposable/temporary email accounts is not permitted. The sending of unsolicited commercial emails to members is prohibited. <br><br>

					We reserve the right to change these terms & conditions in the future where appropriate.<br><br>

					By clicking Register you agree to be bound by these conditions.

				<div id="panel2" class="tabscontent">
					<h2 class="iconsupport">Our Cookie Policy</h2>
					<p>
					<b>This explains what "cookies" are and how we handle them:</b><br><br>
					Most websites you visit will use cookies in order to improve your user experience by enabling that website to 'remember' you, either for the duration of your visit (using a 'session cookie') or for repeat visits (using a 'persistent cookie').<br><br>

					Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, storing your preferences, and generally improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the interaction between you and the website faster and easier.<br><br>

					Cookies are basically pieces of information that a Web Site transfers to your pc/laptop/tablet etc to store and sometimes track basic information about your visit. Cookies contain anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits, dates etc.<br><br>
	
					Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to prevent that. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of a Web Site if you do so. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and cannot be accessed by other servers, which means they cannot be used to track your movements around the web. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify customers or passwords.<br><br>
	
					<b>With whom is any of the information we hold about you shared?</b><br><br>

					We will not share, sell or rent your personal information to third parties.<br><br>
					We will never sell, share, lend or otherwise make available any information relating to our customers or visitors.<br><br>

					We will only disclose information if required to do so by law or if it believes that such action is necessary to protect and defend the rights, property or personal safety of Online Merchants Ltd and its Web Sites, visitors to the Web Sites and customers of our Services.
