Below is the privacy statement for the St. Louis, Missouri based e-company Puzz.com, LLC, which operates the web sites Puzz.com, AllIQTests.com, aMillionQuizzes.com, ThoughtForThisDay.com, RockinSurveys.com, IQSocieties.com, AfreeB.com, OnlineGamingZone.com and FreeDungeons.com, and the promotional email newsletters Surveys & Quizzes, Surveys & Tests and All IQ Tests. We do not sell, share or transfer our email subscriber lists or any other collected personal information (including but not limited to names, postal addresses, email addresses and phone numbers) to or with third parties. We do not subscribe people to our e-mail newsletters unless they request that this is done. Both of these latter two statements were true when we first went into business in 1998, and have always remained true. We have always been committed
                 to safeguarding your privacy.<br><br>
                 The following policy explains how we gather and use personal information in
                 detail. This policy may change from time to time and Puzz.com, LLC reserves the right to change or modify this policy at any
                 time with or without notice. If you have any questions about this policy, please
                 feel free to <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a>.<center><br>

                 Registration:<br><br>
                 Puzz.com, LLC's newsletter subscription forms require individuals to provide basic
                 contact information. We use or may use your contact information (such as your email
                 address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional
                 information about our company, or to investigate in cases of suspected fraud or
                 abuse. You may opt-out of receiving further communications; see the Opting Out
                 of Further Communications section below.<br><br> 

     
                 To better serve you, we may also store the information you present to us via
                 email, postal mail, fax or telephone. This information is or may be used in the same manner as
                 information directly collected using Puzz.com, LLC's forms. We
                 may also use information you provide us via email, postal mail, fax or telephone to pursue the
                 matter for which you contacted us.<br><br> 

                 We use some 3rd party subscription services to generate subscribers for our newsletters. While these companies use a number of filtering and anti-fraud devices, it is possible that someone could submit your e-mail address to us fraudulently. If this occurs, please follow the instructions below under "Opting-Out of Further Communications" and also please <a href="contactus.html">contact us</a>; we can add you to a special "blacklist" that will prevent your address from ever again appearing on any of our lists. If we see a recurrent problem, additional steps will be taken (see below under "Security, Fraud, and Abuse").<br><br>
