<h3><a name="1"></a>Your Consent</h3>
<p>By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of certain information in the manner we describe and agree to be bound by the terms of use as set forth herein. By logging into your cart, you consent to periodic email notifications regarding the status of your check-out process. You may opt out of these any time after your initial notice.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="2"></a>Notification of Changes</h3>
<p>If we decide to change our policies, we will post those changes on this Website. Information collected before changes are made will be secured according to the Policy in place at the time such information is collected notwithstanding future changes to this Policy. The practices and policies in this Policy replace all previous notices or statements with respect to the same subject matter. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="3"></a>Opt-out or Termination of User Accounts</h3>
<p>If users have opted out of all communication with the Website, or deleted/deactivated their account, <a href="http://www.mercola.com">Mercola.com</a> will not contact such users again nor will their personal information ever be used by us in any manner.</p>

<h3><a name="4"></a>Contact Information</h3>
<p>If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please <a href="http://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx">contact us</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="5"></a>Security</h3>
<p>We are committed to preventing others from unauthorized access to the personal information you provide to us, and we maintain commercially reasonable procedures and technology designed for this purpose. The Website has reasonable technical and organizational security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control. However, we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will never be able to defeat those security measures or use your personal information for improper purposes.</p>
<p>When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information, such as credit card number, that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry standard software, 256-bit SSL . While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just &quot;surfing.&quot;</p>
<p>While we use 256-bit SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="6"></a>The Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We request information from the user on our secure order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. We may store this information securely on our server. We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. This information is only shared with other companies who work on behalf of <a href="http://www.mercola.com">Mercola.com</a> to provide a product or service to you. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. We may also use this information to inform you of additional goods and services about which you might be interested or to customize your experience and use of the Website.</p>
<p>We may ask you for personally-identifying information in connection with a promotion or survey. Any email you receive from us, or third parties authorized by you to send email, will contain additional opt-out or unsubscribe options in the email with instructions on how to unsubscribe from receiving future emails.</p>
<p>If you want to send an item to your friend, like a gift card, we will ask for your friend's first name, last name, and email address. We will only use this information to complete your order and send the item to your friend. <a href="http://www.mercola.com">Mercola.com</a> stores this information for the sole purpose of processing this order and tracking the success of your order. Your friend may contact us at <a href="http://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx">http://shop.mercola.com/pages/ContactUs.aspx</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<p>We may automatically gather general statistical information about our website and visitors, such as IP addresses, browsers, pages viewed, number of visitors, goods and services purchased, transactions completed, etc. To do this, we use action tags and cookies provided by our site analytics and marketing partners. Although these partners log the information coming from our site on our behalf, we authorize how that data may and may not be used.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="7"></a>Children Under 13</h3>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13. We have no way of distinguishing the age of individuals who address our website, and so we carry out the same Privacy Policy for individuals of all ages. If a child has provided us with personal information, the parent or guardian should contact us to remove the information and opt out of promotional opportunities.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" style="color: #c00;">^ Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a name="8"></a>Log Files</h3>
<p>Like most standard website servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to other personally identifiable information.</p>
