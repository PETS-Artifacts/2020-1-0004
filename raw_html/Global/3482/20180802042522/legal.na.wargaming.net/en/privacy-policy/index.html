User names and personas are tied to your Account and are non-transferable (meaning they cannot be transferred to anyone else). You may not use a user name or persona that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, imitates any third party, infringes on any proprietary right of any third party, or otherwise breaches this EULA or the Rules. If you have questions about Account registration, please contact us at <a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a> or, for Gods &amp; Glory, <a href="mailto:support_en@godsandglory.com">support_en@godsandglory.com</a>.

<p>5.1.4.	Specifically, in order to use the Resources for Xbox 360 or Xbox One Games, you will need to visit <a href="http://console.worldoftanks.com/">this site</a> and sign in using your Microsoft Xbox Live ID credentials. The Account will be automatically created using your Microsoft Xbox Live ID credentials (e-mail and nickname (gamertag)).

<p>5.1.5.	To access the Resources for PlayStation®4 Games, you need to have a Sony Entertainment Network account.

<p>5.1.6.	In certain cases, including some iOS and Android Games, you may also log in through some third party system, if expressly permitted in the Game.

<p>5.1.7.	Also, if expressly permitted by Wargaming, a “demo account” is possible in certain Games. In this case, you receive no separate username or password. The authorization for the Game is made through the specific technical device (mobile phone, tablet, etc.) that you use.

<p>5.1.8.	However, you are strongly advised to set up a standard Account in accordance with the above provisions. If a "demo account" is used, we are not responsible for keeping your progress in the Game, ensuring availability of game items and Additional Features, or maintaining the safety of any monetary or valuable assets in the Account. Cases when an Account and all connected assets may be lost entirely include the loss of the technical device, loss of password or any unauthorized modification of the operating system ("jailbreaking") or of the software.

<p><strong>5.2	No Account Sharing</strong>

<p>5.2.1	You must keep all information relating to your Account confidential. At no time should you disclose your account ID or password, secret question or answer to anyone. This includes your friends, relatives, parents, children, spouses, co-workers, clan members and clan leader. In case of such disclosure, clause 5.2.2 will apply.

<p>5.2.2	You are fully responsible for the conduct and actions using your Account and for all breaches of this EULA committed using your Account. We shall have no liability to you for any loss or damage arising from disclosure of your Account data to anyone, any unauthorized use of your Account, or any unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information.

<p>5.2.3	Any sale, purchase, lease, rent, exchange, other commercial exploitation of Accounts is prohibited.

<p><strong>5.3	Security of Your Account</strong>

<p>5.3.1	You must ensure that you secure your Account, computer, mobile phone or other device from third party access. Please notify us immediately at <a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a> or, for Gods &amp; Glory, <a href="mailto:support_en@godsandglory.com">support_en@godsandglory.com</a> if you become aware of:

<p>5.3.1.1	any unauthorized use of your Account or any other breach of security; or

<p>5.3.1.2	any hacking tools being used or that might be used in relation to the Resources.

<p>5.3.2	We may employ certain physical, electronic and managerial procedures designed to help safeguard and prevent unauthorized access, use, alteration, modification and/or disclosure of your personal information. Although we use procedures reasonably designed to safeguard the security of your personal information, transmissions made on or through the Internet and personal information stored on our servers or the servers of third parties that we use are vulnerable to attack and cannot be guaranteed to be secure. In addition, submissions made by email are not protected by encryption and are vulnerable to disclosure to third parties, including due to interception during transmission.

<p><strong>5.4	Ownership of Your Account.</strong> NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN YOUR ACCOUNT, AND THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO YOUR ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF WARGAMING. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP, OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES (AS DEFINED BELOW) THAT YOU UNLOCK OR ACCUMULATE, REGARDLESS OF ANY CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR SUCH ADDITIONAL FEATURES. FURTHERMORE, WARGAMING SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE DESTRUCTION, DELETION, MODIFICATION, IMPAIRMENT, HACKING, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME CONTENT OR ADDITIONAL FEATURES, INCLUDING THE DELETION OF GAME CONTENT OR ADDITIONAL FEATURES UPON THE TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT.

<p>6.4	Wargaming makes the Content available to you subject to the following conditions:

<p>6.4.2	you may only obtain Content from us (or from any person or third party that we authorize for this purpose) and you must not obtain Content from any other person or attempt to do so;

<p>6.4.3	we reserve the right to refuse your request(s) to acquire Content, and we also reserve the right to limit or block any request to acquire or obtain Content for any reason;

<p>6.4.4	WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT ANY RESOURCES OR CONTENT WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ALL TIMES, IN ALL COUNTRIES AND/OR ALL GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, OR AT ANY GIVEN TIME OR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER PARTICULAR CONTENT FOR ANY PARTICULAR LENGTH OF TIME (UNLESS WE EXPRESSLY SAY OTHERWISE AS PART OF THE RESOURCES);

<p>6.4.5	once you have redeemed or activated Content, including without limitation any Additional Feature, it is not returnable, exchangeable, or refundable for other Content, cash, goods or services; 

<p>6.4.6	we may change, replace, remove access to or update the Content at any time at our sole discretion; and

<p>6.4.7	we may monitor use of the Resources for a wide variety of different purposes, including preventing cheating and hacking, reducing toxic player behavior and improving the Resources.

<p><strong>7.	Charges and Billing</strong>

<p>7.1	You do not have to pay any registration or subscription fees to create an Account. However, some of the Resources or parts thereof may require you to pay a fee. If you decide to purchase or to subscribe to any such Resources, you must ensure that:

<p>7.1.1	you are 13 years of age or older;

<p>7.1.2	you are the authorized Account holder for the Account from which you are subscribing to the Resources;

<p>7.1.3	you are authorized to use the particular credit card or other accepted payment method;

<p>7.1.4	all information that you submit at the time of purchase is true and accurate; and

<p>7.1.5	you agree to pay all the fees that you incur, including all recurring subscription fees, unless and until you cancel your Account or any particular subscription to any of the Resources in accordance with this EULA. 

<p>7.2	Any applicable fees and other charges on your Account are payable in advance and are not refundable. We may, from time to time, without prior notice modify, amend, or supplement payment methods offered within the Resources. We will post those changes in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s).

<p>7.3	The final price of the purchase and/or subscription may vary depending on the selected payment method. To see the final price, click the button for the selected payment method. Please check currency exchange fees and charges in case payment currency is different from the currency of the selected payment method.

<p>7.4	Prices for the purchases of the Resources are published in the corresponding section of the relevant Resource(s). Wargaming reserves the right to change the price at any time by making a respective change on the Resource(s). By making a purchase you are considered to demonstrate consent with the price. Price changes for any subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use the Resources after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by unsubscribing from the service prior to the price change going into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.

<p>7.5	We do our best to describe our services, Resources and prices thereof as accurately as possible. However, we are human, and therefore we do not warrant that product specifications, pricing, or other content on the Resources is complete, accurate, reliable, current, or error-free. In the event of any errors relating to the pricing or specifications, Wargaming shall have the right to refuse or cancel any purchase or subscription in its sole discretion. If we charged your credit card or other account prior to our cancellation, we will issue a refund in the amount of the charge. If you have already used your purchase or subscription has already expired, Wargaming reserves the right to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Resource(s). If a subscription or service you purchased from Wargaming is not as described, your sole remedy is to cancel the purchase and receive a refund in the amount of the purchase price.

<p>7.6	Please remember that your Account is personal to you and cannot be transferred or traded with any other user.

<p>7.7	IF YOU ARE PLAYING OUR GAMES ON EXTERNAL PLATFORMS SUCH AS MICROSOFT XBOX, SONY PLAYSTATION®, APPLE IOS OR GOOGLE ANDROID, YOU MUST ALSO COMPLY WITH ALL THIRD PARTY TERMS SET BY THOSE THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS. THE CHARGING AND BILLING IN SUCH GAMES ARE SUBJECT TO RULES OF THE THOSE PLATFORMS. WARGAMING DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY OF ANY NATURE FOR SUCH PLATFORMS' ACTIONS.

<p><strong>8.	Additional Features</strong>

<p>8.1	<strong>Additional Features.</strong> The Resources may permit you to acquire and accumulate rights to certain additional virtual game content, features and functionalities (including rights to in-game assets and points) as made available by Wargaming (“<strong>Additional Features</strong>”) which you are granted a license to use pursuant to the terms of this EULA. Additional Features constitute a limited, non-transferable, revocable right to use features of the Resources when, as, and if allowed by Wargaming and solely as governed by and permitted under this EULA. Subject to this EULA, Additional Features may be exchanged for access to upgraded features, may be exchanged for other Additional Features, or used in connection with other features made available by Wargaming through the Resources. Additional Features are not real-world currency, have no monetary value, and cannot be used, exchanged, or redeemed except as provided in this EULA, and cannot be transferred, in any case. For avoidance of doubt, Additional Features are not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Wargaming or any third party at any time; provided, however, if and to the extent that any Additional Features are determined by applicable law to constitute real world currency or property, then they are the property of Wargaming.

<p>8.2	<strong>Acquiring Additional Features.</strong> You may accrue Additional Features in a variety of ways. Wargaming may distribute or provide access to Additional Features in exchange for taking certain actions (either directly within the Resources, or in connection with a third party service), for a fee, or without any fee or required action, in its sole discretion. Wargaming may charge fees for the right to exercise rights associated with Additional Features. You agree that you do not "own" the Additional Features and that Wargaming has the absolute right to manage, regulate, control, modify and/or eliminate such Additional Features in its sole discretion, in any general or specific case, and that Wargaming will have no liability to you based on its exercise of such right. Wargaming allows you to accumulate and manage your Additional Features, and may use terms such as "buy" and "sell" to refer to the grant or transfer of rights to use the Resources. Use of terms such as "buy" or "sell" does not indicate any ownership right. The total amount of a purchase may be adjusted by adding a fee, if any, applicable to the payment method you selected and for mandatory tax payments, if any, required by law. If adjusted, the total amount of the purchase will be recalculated automatically and displayed before you confirm the purchase, provided, however, that such functionality is supported by a chosen payment method. If your payment is in a currency other than that of the purchase amount shown on the Site, the exchange rate applied will depend on the selected payment method. 

<p>8.3	<strong>Additional Terms and Conditions.</strong> Without limiting the foregoing, the following rules apply to Additional Features:

<p>8.3.1	Additional Features may only be redeemed for other Additional Features where permitted in the Resources;

<p>8.3.2	Once you have purchased Additional Features, those Additional Features are non-refundable and non-exchangeable (whether or not you use them);

<p>8.3.3	Additional Features cannot be sold or transferred to anyone, but you may buy Additional Features for another user of a Game through the gift shop applicable to that Game;

<p>8.3.4	Additional Features cannot be exchanged for cash or any goods or services (except other Additional Features as permitted in the Resources);

<p>8.3.5	To acquire Additional Features, you need to follow the instructions provided in the Resources; this can include making a payment and providing personal and financial details (which you represent shall be complete and accurate).

<p>8.3.6	The price payable for the Additional Features (including any value added tax or other applicable taxes of duties) will be as set out on our Sites or as part of the Resources (as applicable), but we reserve the right to change the price of Additional Features at any time at our discretion;

<p>8.3.7	We do not make any promises about how or when Additional Features may be available and can update or change Additional Features at any time;

<p>8.3.8	If you receive Additional Features or achievements free of charge, at a lower price or without performing the actions that are normally required for receipt (e.g., experience points without playing the Game) (i) due to a technical error (a bug), you must report this to Wargaming immediately; or (ii) due to hacking, fraud or other illegal actions, you must report this to Wargaming immediately and pay for such Additional Features to the extent already consumed. In each case, Wargaming may delete such Additional Features and achievement without any notice to you and, if you have already consumed the Additional Features, to block access to your Account until you reimburse the full price of the corresponding Additional Feature(s). 

<p>8.3.9	You may only acquire Additional Features from us (or from any person that we authorize for this purpose), or from another authorized user of a Game through the use of a feature included in the Game by Wargaming expressly for such purpose (such as a gift through the gift shop applicable to that Game), and you must not obtain Additional Features from any other person or in any other way or attempt to do so; and

<p>8.3.10	We may limit or block a request to acquire Additional Features for any reason.

<p>8.4	<strong>Non-Refundable Purchase.</strong> In the event you purchase Additional Features from Wargaming, we will transfer the Additional Features to you only once that payment has been processed, and you may start using Additional Features as soon as you have completed the purchase process. You therefore have no right to cancel any transaction to purchase Additional Features after completion of the purchase process and being entitled to download the Additional Features.

<p><strong>8.5	Restrictions.</strong> You agree and acknowledge that Wargaming may deny or place limitations or restrictions on any purchase, issue, or redemption of Additional Features, individually or with respect to general volume, at any time and for any reason. Wargaming may halt, suspend, discontinue, or reverse any Additional Features transaction (whether proposed, pending or past) in cases of actual or suspected fraud, violations of other laws or regulations, or deliberate disruptions to or interference with the Resources, or the service of any affiliated or related third party.

<p><strong>8.6	Gifts.</strong> The following rules apply in regard to the gifts made through the Premium Shop:

<p>8.6.1	As of the latest ToS update, gifts are only available in World of Tanks, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. Please check for updates.

<p>8.6.2	Please note that gifts can be made within the same game server region only, i.e., gifts from an account on the North America server cannot be made to players on the EU server.

<p>8.6.5	Within 24 hours after a recipient accepts or declines a gift, the sender will receive a notification via email.

<p>8.6.6	If a recipient of a gift already owns a vehicle included in the gift, that vehicle's full cost in gold as at the time of purchase in the Premium Shop will be automatically compensated to the recipient. The vehicle will not be transferred to the recipient's account.

<p>8.6.7	Any vehicles sent as a gift will be transferred together with a corresponding Garage Slot.

<p>8.6.8	If the sender of a gift cancels the payment or fails to pay after the recipient accepts the gift, both accounts will be blocked until the circumstances are clarified. Please do not accept gifts from unknown senders.

<p><strong>9.	Fan Websites</strong>

<p>9.2	At some of our Sites we expressly designate certain Content, such as Wargaming game-related images, graphics or artwork and trademarks, as being "<strong>for fansite use</strong>" (for example see: <a href="https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/announcements/world-tanks-fansite-kit/">https://worldoftanks.com/en/news/announcements/world-tanks-fansite-kit/</a>).

<p>9.3.8	you must not make, or seek to make, any commercial use or profit out of the Fansite Content (including for example by selling subscriptions to your Fansite) without our prior written consent.

<p>9.4	If you fail to comply with any of the terms set out in this section, we reserve the right to terminate your license over the Fansite Content and also to close your Account.

<p><strong>11.	Feedback and User Submissions</strong>

<p>11.1	We are always pleased to hear from our users and welcome specific comments about our Resources. Unfortunately, however, our long-standing company policy does not allow us to accept or consider creative ideas, suggestions or materials other than those we have specifically requested. The aim of this policy is to avoid the possibility of future misunderstandings when projects that we develop might seem to others to be similar to their own creative work. Accordingly, we must, regretfully, ask that you do not send us any original creative suggestions, ideas, notes, drawings, concepts or other information such as game ideas or original artwork ("<strong>Submissions</strong>").

<p>11.2	Any and all Submissions that you send to us, whether at our specific request or notwithstanding our request that you do not do so, shall be deemed, and shall remain, our property from the time of uploading or transmission.

<p>11.3	Accordingly, you hereby assign to Wargaming (including as a present assignment of future rights) all intellectual property rights in Submissions that you send to us to the extent owned by you. If for any reason this assignment is not effective, then you agree that Wargaming shall have a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, combine with other materials, publish, distribute, create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, sublicense (including, without limitation, to third party media channels, platforms, and distributors), publicly perform, publicly display, and otherwise use and exploit in any manner whatsoever, or grant third parties the right to do any of the foregoing, all or any portion of your Submissions, for any purpose whatsoever in all formats, on or through any means or medium now known or hereafter developed, and with any technology or devices now known or hereafter developed, and to advertise, market, and promote the same. You further irrevocably grant us the right, but not the obligation, to use your name in connection with your Submissions. You also agree to waive any right of approval for our use of the rights granted herein and agree to waive any moral rights that you may have in any Submissions, even if it is altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. To the extent not waivable, you irrevocably agree not to exercise such rights in a manner that interferes with any exercise of the granted rights. To the extent permitted by applicable laws, you also waive any moral rights or rights of a like nature that you may have in such Submissions.

<p>11.4	You understand that you will not receive any fees, sums, consideration, or remuneration for any of the rights granted in this section. Our receipt of your Submissions is not an admission of their novelty, priority, or originality, and it does not impair our right to existing or future intellectual property rights relating to your Submissions. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to grant us the rights granted in this section.

<p><strong>12.	Rules</strong>

<p><strong>13.	Suspension and Termination of Use, Account or Resources</strong>

<p>13.1	If you violate any provision of this EULA, then we may, at our sole discretion depending on the seriousness of the breach and without any notice to you, take some or all of the following actions:

<ol>
<li>suspend your Account for a short period of time;
<li>suspend your Account for a longer period of time; and
<li>may terminate your Account, and
</ol>

<p>in each case the level of seriousness of the breach shall be determined exclusively by Wargaming and you agree not to appeal against such Wargaming decisions.

<p>13.2	If we suspend your Account, then during the period of that suspension you will not be able to access your Account or use any of the Resources. If we close your Account, then you will never be able to access your Account and we may also prohibit you from accessing or using the Resources in future.

<p>13.3	We will terminate your Account in very serious circumstances where we consider that a suspension is not sufficient. For example, this might include a very serious contravention of this EULA, the Rules or the Privacy Policy, rules of third party platforms or where you have contravened the abovementioned rules or any of them on numerous occasions.

<p>13.4	We also reserve the right to modify or discontinue any or all of the Resources at any time (including, without limitation, by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Resources) without notice to you. We will have no liability whatsoever on account of any change to the Resources or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Resources.

<p><strong>14.	Interruptions to the Resources</strong>

<p>14.1	From time to time we may need to update, reset, temporarily interrupt or shut down some or all of the Resources. Any of these actions may cause you to lose access to the Resources temporarily and/or cause you setbacks within a Game or other aspects of your use of the Resources. Please bear in mind that these activities are sometimes required to enable us to continue to provide the Resources.

<p>14.2	We shall have no liability to you if the Resources or any aspect of them (including any Additional Features, accounts, statistics, user ranks or profile information) are interrupted or unavailable for any reason. We may suspend or terminate the availability of the Resources and Content, in whole or in part, to any individual user or all users, for any reason, at Wargaming’s sole discretion, and without any advance notice or liability.

<p><strong>15.	Links to Third Party Sites</strong>

<p>The Resources may include content from and hyperlinks to web sites, locations, platforms and services operated and owned by third parties including advertisers and other content providers (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). We may also integrate third party technologies into our Resources and host our content on Third Party Services. Those Third Party Services may collect data or solicit personal information from you. We do not own, control or operate such Third Party Services, and are not responsible for their information, content, privacy policies, or for the collection, use or disclosure of any information those Third Party Services may collect. If you choose to access, transact with, or otherwise interact with any such Third Party Services, you do so at your own risk. For more information on Third Party Services, see our Privacy Policy.

<p><strong>16.	Technical Requirements</strong>

<p>17.1.2	remove or suspend access to particular features, content or other parts of the Resources.

<p>17.2	We need to take the actions referred to in this section automatically in order to keep the Resources running efficiently.

<p><strong>18.	Alpha and Beta Tests</strong>

<p>18.1	We may give you the opportunity to alpha or beta test new games and features of the Resources. Your participation as an alpha/beta tester is subject to the following terms and conditions.

<p>18.2	Unless expressly indicated otherwise, all alpha/beta tests are confidential. The alpha/beta games, including information about features and functionality to be offered as part of the games, are confidential. If you participate in an alpha/beta test, you must safeguard and prevent unauthorized access to, copying, disclosure, and unauthorized use of the alpha/beta games. You will carry out the testing personally and not provide access to alpha/beta games to any other person. Your obligation to keep the alpha/beta games confidential will continue until we publicly distribute, or otherwise disclose to the public through no fault of yours, each of the games and the content that you are testing.

<p>18.3	If Wargaming notifies you that you have been selected as an alpha/beta tester for an applicable alpha/beta game, you are invited to play the alpha/beta game for the sole purpose of evaluating the alpha/beta game and identifying errors. Nothing in this EULA or the Sites shall be construed as granting you any rights or privileges of any kind with respect to the alpha/beta games. THE ALPHA/BETA GAMES ARE PROVIDED FOR TESTING ON AN "AS IS" BASIS AND WE MAKE NO WARRANTY TO YOU OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

<p>18.4	When playing certain alpha/beta games, you may accumulate or have access to Additional Features or other features referred to as treasure, experience points, equipment, or other value or status indicators. We may reset this data when the relevant game completes this testing phase or at any time during the testing process. In this case, all player history and data will be erased and each player will return to novice status.

<p>18.5	By starting an alpha/beta game, you agree that:

<p>18.5.1	playing alpha/beta Games is at your own risk and that you know that the games may include known or unknown bugs;

<p>18.5.2	any value or status indicators that you achieve through game play may be erased at any time;

<p>18.5.3	we have no obligation to make these Games available for play without charge for any period of time, nor to make them available at all;

<p>18.5.4	these Games may be available only by subscription once the testing process is complete or at any time in the future;

<p>18.5.5	this EULA applies to your use of the games during the testing phase; and

<p>18.5.6	unless otherwise expressly indicated by Wargaming, you will keep all information about the alpha/beta games confidential and not disclose such information to any other person.

<p><strong>19.	Epilepsy Warning</strong>

<p>Certain people are susceptible to epileptic seizures or loss of consciousness when exposed to certain flashing lights or light patterns in everyday life. Such people may have a seizure while watching certain monitor images or playing certain video games. This may happen even if the person has no medical history of epilepsy or has never had any epileptic seizures. If you or anyone in your family has ever had symptoms related to epilepsy (seizures or loss of consciousness) when exposed to flashing lights, consult your doctor prior to playing. We advise that parents should monitor the use of video games by their children. If you or your child experience any of the following symptoms: dizziness, blurred vision, eye or muscle twitches, loss of consciousness, disorientation, any involuntary movement or convulsion, while playing a video game, IMMEDIATELY discontinue use of the video game and consult your doctor. Please also note that when using a video game you should take certain standard health and safety precautions, including avoiding playing the game when tired or fatigued, taking 10 to 15 minute breaks every hour, sitting a reasonable distance from the screen, and playing the game in a well-lit environment.

<p><strong>22.	Disclaimers; No Warranties</strong>

<p>22.1	EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN, THE RESOURCES, GAMES, ANCILLARY SERVICES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RESOURCES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES SPECIFICALLY (BUT WITHOUT LIMITATION) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER STATUTORY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, RELATING TO THE RESOURCES AND ALL CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RESOURCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO (i) ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT; AND (ii) ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF THE COURSE OF DEALING, USAGE, OR TRADE. THE WARGAMING ENTITIES DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE RESOURCES OR ANY PART THEREOF, OR ANY MATERIALS OR CONTENT OFFERED THROUGH THE RESOURCES, WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE OF ERRORS, VIRUSES, OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE CORRECTED. SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

<p>22.2	YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOU USE THE RESOURCES AND USE, ACCESS, DOWNLOAD, OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN MATERIALS OR CONTENT THROUGH THE RESOURCES AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESOURCES) OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE USE OF THE RESOURCES OR THE DOWNLOAD OR USE OF ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT.

<p><strong>23.	Limitation of Liability</strong>

<p>23.1	IN NO EVENT WILL THE WARGAMING ENTITIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR RESOURCES) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE RESOURCES OR ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT ON OR THROUGH THE RESOURCES, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), STATUTE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY AND WHETHER OR NOT THE WARGAMING ENTITIES HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

<p>23.2	YOU AGREE THAT THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF THE WARGAMING ENTITIES TO YOU FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF RELATING TO THE USE OF OR ANY INABILITY TO USE THE RESOURCES (INCLUDING ANY GAMES, MATERIALS OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE RESOURCES) OR OTHERWISE UNDER THIS EULA, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (i) THE AMOUNTS YOU HAVE PAID TO WARGAMING IN THE 12 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE CLAIM FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SPECIFIC RESOURCES OR GAME FROM WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE OR (ii) $100.

<p>23.3	SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

<p>23.4	EACH PROVISION OF THIS EULA THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS EULA BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN THE PARTIES. EACH OF THESE PROVISIONS IS SEVERABLE AND INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THIS EULA. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION 21 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

<p><strong>24.	Governing Law and Jurisdiction</strong>

<p>This EULA and any dispute, claim or obligation (whether contractual or non-contractual) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is permitted hereunder, you and Wargaming agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Alameda County, California, USA for the purpose of litigating all such disputes.

<p><strong>25.	Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</strong>

<p>25.1	<strong>Generally</strong>. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and Wargaming in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and Wargaming agree that any and all disputes arising in connection with this EULA shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of this EULA, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of this EULA. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND WARGAMING ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</strong>

<p>25.2	<strong>Exceptions</strong>. Notwithstanding subsection 25.1, we both agree that nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.

<p>25.3	<strong>Arbitrator</strong>. Any arbitration between you and Wargaming will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "<strong>AAA Rules</strong>") of the American Arbitration Association ("<strong>AAA</strong>"), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting Wargaming.

<p>25.4	<strong>Notice; Process.</strong> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for you, by electronic mail ("<strong>Notice</strong>"). Wargaming's address for Notice is: Wargaming Group Limited, 105, Agion Omologiton Avenue, Nicosia 1080, Cyprus. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought ("<strong>Demand</strong>"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Wargaming may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or Wargaming shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, Wargaming shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by Wargaming in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.

<p>25.5	Fees. In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, Wargaming will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Alameda County, California, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Wargaming for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.

<p>25.6	<strong>No Class Actions. YOU AND WARGAMING AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both you and Wargaming agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

<p>25.7	<strong>Modifications</strong>. In the event that Wargaming makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to Wargaming's address for Notice), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to Wargaming's address for Notice, in which case your account with Wargaming shall be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.

<p>25.8	<strong>Enforceability</strong>. If Subsection 25.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 25 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 25 shall be null and void and, in such case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 25 shall govern any action arising out of or related to this EULA.

<p><strong>3. GENERAL INFORMATION IN BRIEF</strong>

<p>We process personal data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.

<p>Our legitimate interests are to provide our Services in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Services.

<p><strong>3.1. YOUR PREFERENCES</strong>

<p>You can choose how we use your Personal Data using our Account Management Tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management Tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>.

<p>For example, through the Account Management Tool you can: 

<ul>
<li>•	opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 7.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
<li>access the Personal Data we store about you. Read more below in Section 7.2 “Right of Access”;
<li>have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section  7.4 “Right to erasure”. 
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>

<p>We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. 

<p><strong>3.3. PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES</strong> 

<p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 6 “How we share your information”.

<p><strong>3.4. CHILDREN</strong>

<p>We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law).

<p><strong>3.5. DATA RETENTION</strong>

<p>We keep most of your Personal Data gathered and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Services, e.g. you have an activated Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account deletion and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 7.3 “Right to erasure”.

<p><strong>3.6. GAMES NOT USING THE ACCOUNT</strong> 

<p>Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete it, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 7 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions. 

<p>Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games. For example, we do not collect your phone number and email address if you use the Games for which the Account is not created.

<p>With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by filing a request to that effect to Customer Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game. 

<p>Finally, you may link some of the Games that do not use the Account to your Account (where such function is available). Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Customer Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management.

<p><strong>4. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>

<p><strong>4.2.2. Game-Related Information, Device Information, Geo-Location</strong>

<p>In order to provide you with efficient services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Games. “<strong>Game-Related Information</strong>” includes your in-game identifier, which for most of our Games is known as “Wargaming ID”, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about your Games preferences, progress in the Games, participation in clans, frequency of playing, as well as information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

<p><strong>4.2.3. Information required for fraud and violations detection</strong>

<p>We may also collect certain data (like IP address, username, etc.) that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game, and is deleted six months after its collection, unless the data can be used to prove that cheating has occurred. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations. 

<p><strong>4.2.4. Information from publicly available online resources</strong>

<p>We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Services, so that we could take them into account while improving our Services.

<p><strong>4.2.5. Information from our partners</strong>

<p>In order to fulfil our obligation under the EULA and when processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We also use your identifiers on other platforms like PlayStation®4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, so that you can play our games through these platforms. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their instructions and applicable laws. When you purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "gold") or time-limited premium memberships with your credit card, we may receive from our payment partners and process a part of your credit card number, information about your credit card issuer, as well as your full address for billing purposes.

<p><strong>5. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>We need to process your Personal Data in order to fulfil the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

<ul>
<li>to provide you with the Services you request; 
<li>to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies;
<li>to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;
<li>to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.
</ul>

<p><strong>5.1. COMMUNICATION PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.

<p><strong>5.2. SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We analyse the Tracking Data, Content Data and Game-Related Information to identify how to improve the Services and our operations to make them more interesting for our players in general. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys and you have choices about the information you provide.

<p><strong>5.3. TARGETED IN-GAME OFFERS</strong>

<p>We may also use the Game-Related Information to send you certain in-game offers that we believe are the most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify whether you follow the pattern, if we apply the algorithm and it says that you do actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offer to you. We make sure that such offers never have any significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.

<p><strong>5.4. FRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION</strong>

<p>We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game rules and policies only for the purposes of such detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

<p><strong>6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>For the performance of a contract with you, compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, and based on our legitimate interests, we may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties:

<li><strong>Advertising and advertising measurement partners:</strong> we share your email, nickname, IP address and other information you provide to us in order to facilitate targeting, delivery, and measurement of online advertising on third-party services, or otherwise facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, or of interest to you, with such companies as Emarsys UK Ltd, Unity Technologies APS; 
<li><strong>Data storage partners:</strong> we store some of your information using third-party data storage services, e.g. we store most of your responses to our in-game questionnaires using the services of Widgix, LLC dba Survey Gizmo, while some of your game statistics is stored using the services of Amazon Web Services, Inc.; 
<li><strong>Research partners:</strong> we may provide access to some of your data, such as your Game statistics, to provide marketing-related and other research. We share anonymous data with our partners unless your personal data is necessary for the requested services or research;
<li><strong>Customer support partners:</strong> for some territories and products we engage third parties to provide you with appropriate customer support services. Such companies may get access to your personal data, including personal data that you may provide in your customer support requests. Such partners include Zendesk Inc, iOpex Technologies Inc.;
<li><strong>Developers of applications based on the Game:</strong> we make your nickname and some of your Game statistics available to other players and our partners through Public API. The data can be used for developing and support of the applications created by the Game community, mobile applications, e.g. World of Tanks Assistant. Public API enables us to improve your gaming experience, fulfil potential of our community, and put use of our players’ statistics under our control by creating rules and requirements for their use by other players and community;
<li><strong>Publicly available information:</strong> our Sites may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, please use our Account Management tool to request its removal. If we may not be able to remove your personal information promptly, we will let you know about the reasons.
<li><strong>External moderators and testers:</strong> some limited data about you (such as your nickname, content of customer support ticket) may become available to third party volunteering moderators and testers who contribute to providing you with better Services, e.g. to quickly respond to your questions about the Games. 
<li><strong>Anti-cheat and anti-fraud companies:</strong> we may share the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Games and EULA violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game.
<li><strong>Wargaming subsidiaries and affiliates:</strong> as a global company, we collect information that may be processed in our offices worldwide. Your information may also be processed outside of the European Economic Area, e.g. in the United States, the Republic of Belarus, or any other country in which we, our affiliates or subsidiaries maintain presence.
<li><strong>Change of control:</strong> we may share your data as part of our company’s sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any entity which buys us, or part of our business will have the right to continue using your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
</ol>

<p>When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties. We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.

<p><strong>Sharing anonymous information.</strong> We also may share anonymous information, i.e. information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us.

<p><strong>7. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>

<p>To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management.  If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a> or – for Console Games – <a href="https://console.worldoftanks.com/">here</a>. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.ef="http://wargaming.net/"&gt;here</a>. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.

<p><strong>7.1. OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>

<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone and are not specifically directed to you.

<p>You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).

<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

<p><strong>7.2. RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>

<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc. 

<p><strong>7.3. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>

<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country, social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate. 

<p><strong>7.4. RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>

<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools.

<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for. 

<p><strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request. 

<p><strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.

<p><strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:

<ul>
<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 30 (thirty) days of us sending the award to your address;
<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, vk.com for the period when <li>we are generating the reports for our Services improvement and for 30 (thirty) days after that; 
technical logs such as records of communication between Services, access logs, errors logs: normally within 30 (thirty) days from their creation.
</ul>

<p><strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.

<p><strong>8. WE CAN CHANGE THIS POLICY</strong>

<p>We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected.</div>

<p>IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!

<p>BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING OUR GAME(S) OR SERVICE(S) IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THESE RULES. 
IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR RULES, PLEASE DO NOT PROCEED WITH THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AND LEAVE OUR SITES IMMEDIATELY AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR WEBSITE(S), GAME(S), OR SERVICE(S).

<p><strong>1. General Provisions</strong>

<p>1.01. In order to register, players must be thirteen (13) years of age or older. All players are solely responsible for their behavior in both public and battle chat. Players are responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others, and are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password on any other sites where it may be read by the owners or administrators of that site. It is highly discouraged for users to share accounts with others. In the case of an account that has been lost or hacked, please inform technical support immediately through their website, Support.

<p>If you are under 13 years of age or other minimum legal age where it differs under local legal requirements, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve this EULA on your behalf. If you are under the aforesaid age, you must not use or access the Game without a parent or legal guardian supervising you.

<p>1.02. The developers (Wargaming.net) of this software are not responsible for the behavior of any individual player, as well as for the content of his or her messages in all game chats and channels. Players are solely responsible for their behavior and the content of their messages in all game chats and channels.

<p>1.03. Wargaming.net reserves the right to evaluate each incident on a case by case basis. The action that may be taken may be more lenient or more severe than those listed under each category.

<p>1.04. Wargaming.net may suspend, terminate, modify, or delete accounts at any time for any reason or for no reason, with or without notice to the owner of the account. Accounts terminated by Wargaming.net for any type of abuse, including without limitation a violation of these rules or the EULA, will not be reactivated for any reason. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of these rules, the End User License Agreement (EULA), or other Wargaming.net policy. Players may cancel any account registered to themselves at any time by following the instructions on the Website. Wargaming.net may stop offering and/or supporting any service at any time.

<p>1.05. Players who decide to be involved with the game acknowledge and agree to these and all other relevant rules and will abide by them regardless of the circumstances. In addition players also agree that these Rules will apply to anyone that is allowed to use their Wargaming.net account or user ID. By allowing another user to use the account, the account owner is personally responsible for all the consequences (including termination of said account) which may result, if the above discussed person violates any of the listed rules at any time. The account owner will not be entitled to a refund of any currency or any form of credit.

<p>1.06. Administration does not bear responsibility for any inter-clan relationship. It is at sole discretion of clan leaders, their deputies, and officers to carefully choose clan members (especially whilst assigning clan members to important offices such as the clan treasury). By assigning a clan member to a respective office clan leader confirms his confidence in the member. Privates, from their side, confirm that they accept clan rules and regulations by entering the respective clan. Note, that in the event of a conflict within a clan, information, such as treasury logs (and similar) will not be provided on request.

<p><strong>4. Inappropriate conduct in game / Fair play principles</strong>

The following actions are prohibited in game:

<p>4.01. Intentionally damaging vehicles belonging to a player on the same team (team damage).

<p>4.02. Intentionally destroying vehicles belonging to a player on the same team (team kill).

<p>4.03. Intentionally blocking (blocking from front and rear) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.

<p>4.04. Intentionally propping (blocking on one side, where the other side of a user's vehicle touches a fixed indestructible obstacle, preventing free movement.) vehicles belonging to a player on the same team.

<p>4.05. Intentionally informing participants of the opposing team through battle, or voice chat, the location of vehicles belonging to players of the same team.

<p>4.06. Intentionally exploiting the physics system to damage an allied tank, plane, ship or similar actions. This includes, but is not limited to, pushing an allied tank into line of fire, pushing allied tanks off of cliffs, bridges, into water, etc.

<p>4.07. Using bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player within the battle (excessive and repetitive passive play).

<p><strong>5. Rules Enforcement</strong>

<p>The "Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who massively cause damage to vehicles of their own team (team damage), or intentionally destroy vehicles of their teammates (team kill).

<p><strong>Please note that the Automated Anti-TD/TK Reporting System is not available in certain Games, for instance, World of Tanks Blitz, World of Warplanes and World of Warships. In such cases, please contact us through</strong> <a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a>.

<p>5.01. Based on combat logs for a particular period of time, usually several days, the automated system finds players involved in friendly fire and team kill incidents. The calculations are quite complicated and the main factor that is taken into account is damage inflicted to allies to total damage ratio.

<p>5.02. If the above ratio for a particular user exceeds a certain fixed threshold value, the system identifies the user as a violator, since his main target is doing damage to allied vehicles.

<p>5.03. If the damage ratio for such user exceeds the verifying coefficient, introduced in order to make distinction between intentional and accidental team killers, such user is identified as an offender and goes onto the suspension list.

<p>5.04. While calculating damage to allies / total damage ratio only the battles with team kill/damage incidents are taken into account.

<p>5.05. In connection with the introduction of Automated Anti-TK Reporting System), listed below are set uniform measures that can be taken against offenders:*. First detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager leads to 1 hour game account suspension.*. Second detection of a user as a team killer and team-damager (recidivism) leads to 1 day game account suspension.*. Multiple detections of a user as a team killer and team-damager (systemic recidivism) will resort in escalating suspensions leading to a PERMANENT game account suspension.

<p>The "Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System" is the system that actively scans the game logs searching for players who use automated bots, clickers, macros, keyboard and mouse recorders, or any other similar methods to accumulate credits and experience without the participation or with passive participation of the player.

<p>5.06. In the case of detection of single or short-term signs of use of automated scripts (bot software) in user's logs, user's account is taken under thorough control by the administration. The owner of the account can be informed by special notifications sent to the registered e-mail.

<p>5.07. In case of detection of signs of massive or overt use of automated scripts or botting software in user's logs, the user's account is suspended permanently, with a possibility of suspension being lifted in the future, after the administration conducts a complete rollback of vehicles, achievements, funds (credits) and research except premium tanks, premium consumables, premium shells and gold.

<p>5.08. Automated Anti-Bot Reporting System is not meant to substitute the Technical Support service, the system aims at making their work easier. The most difficult cases thereby will be solved individually via Technical Support service.

<p><strong>6. Reporting in-game violations</strong>

<p>In certain Games you will be able to use the Automated Anti-TK Reporting System. In this case, an automated system of violations tracking (team damage, team kill) will operate and the administration draws your attention to the following information - with the introduction of this system, users' complaints about the above mentioned violations will not be considered. From now on all punishments for team damage and team kill incidents will be executed <strong>automatically without support service workers' interference</strong>. The system has been customized, tested multiple times and currently works correctly. We also draw your attention to the fact that a multitude of all possible circumstances accompanying different violations (including extenuating and aggravating ones) has been taken into consideration. All requests relating to ban cancellation or minimizing the punishment period, laid by the system, <strong>will be ignored</strong>. Additional information on the automated system of team killers and bot users tracking you will find on this page:

<p><a href="http://forum.worldoftanks.com/index.php?/topic/152218-friendly-fire-team-kill-auto-system/">Automated Anti-TK Reporting System</a>

<p><strong>7. Official Language</strong>

<p>7.01. General chat: The preferred language of the In Game Garage Chat &amp; Company lobby (or General Chat in World of Tanks Blitz) is any of our supported languages (English, Spanish, and Portuguese). Players who wish to communicate in their native language are urged to do so in channels created specifically for their language.

<p>7.02. In Game Battles and other In Game Chats: The preferred language is English, however non-English is allowed. Please be patient with players whose first language may not be your own.

<p>Please note that chat channels are not available in World of Tanks Blitz.

<p><strong>8. Important/Miscellaneous</strong>

<p>8.01. Repeated violations any area of these Rules or the EULA, including the areas detailed above, will often result in permanent suspension from the game and/or forums.

<p>8.02. This policy is not language-restrictive. Language that falls under this policy will always be subject to the repercussions listed, whether it is inappropriate in English or any other language.

<p>8.03. Players may provide feedback or address any concerns to: Technical Support service (forum and game suspension appeals), website: <a href="https://na.wargaming.net/support/">https://na.wargaming.net/support/</a>.</div>

All rights reserved.</p> <p>This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original Work:</p> <p>Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1</p> <p>1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the following:</p> <p>a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;</p> <p>b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original Work;</p> <p>c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;</p> <p>d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and</p> <p>e) to display the Original Work publicly.</p> <p>2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the Original Work and Derivative Works.</p> <p>3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.</p> <p>4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.</p> <p>5) This section intentionally omitted.</p> <p>6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.</p> <p>7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.</p> <p>8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.</p> <p>9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.</p> <p>10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.</p> <p>11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License.</p> <p>13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.</p> <p>14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.</p> <p>15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.</p> <p>This license is Copyright (C) 2003-2004 Lawrence E.

<p>IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ CAREFULLY! BY INSTALLING, COPYING, OR OTHERWISE USING OUR GAME “GODS &amp; GLORY” (“GAME”) OR ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND WEBSITES IN ANY MANNER, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE RULES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR RULES, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR GAME, SERVICES OR WEBSITES.</p>

<p><strong>1. General Provisions</strong></p>

<p>1.01. In order to register, players must be thirteen (13) years of age or older. All players are solely responsible for their behavior in the Game. Players are responsible for protecting their accounts from access by others, and are strongly encouraged to select a hard-to-guess password and not re-use that password where it may be read by the owners or administrators of other resources. In the case of an account that has been lost or hacked, please inform technical support immediately at <a href="mailto:support_en@godsandglory.com">support_en@godsandglory.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you are under 13 years of age or other minimum legal age where it differs under local legal requirements, please ask your parent or guardian to review and approve these Rules on your behalf. If you are under the aforesaid age, you must not use or access the Game without a parent or legal guardian supervising you.</p>

<p><strong>3. GENERAL INFORMATION IN BRIEF</strong>

<p>We process personal data only when necessary for the performance of a contract with you. Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, or based on our legitimate interests, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms for which require the protection of your Personal Data.

<p>Our legitimate interests are to provide our Services in an effective, safe and harmless manner. We want to provide everyone with a fair and balanced experience when using our Services.

<p><strong>3.1. YOUR PREFERENCES</strong>

<p>You can choose how we use your Personal Data using our Account Management Tool. As we need to verify your identity before we follow your instructions on Personal Data use, you need to have a registered Account in order to access the Account Management Tool. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a>.

<p>For example, through the Account Management Tool you can: 

<ul>
<li>•	opt-out of receiving direct marketing, offered via email, within Games and online. Read more below in Section 7.1 “Opt-Out of Direct Marketing and Right to Object”;
<li>access the Personal Data we store about you. Read more below in Section 7.2 “Right of Access”;
<li>have your Account, and the related Personal Data, deleted. Read more below in Section  7.4 “Right to erasure”. 
</ul>

<p><strong>3.2. INFORMATION SECURITY</strong>

<p>We and our employees understand the need for user privacy, and we maintain reasonable and appropriate security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse and unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the Personal Data. 

<p><strong>3.3. PROCESSING INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTIES</strong> 

<p>We may share Personal Data with our affiliates, subsidiaries, vendors or agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. For example, we may hire companies to assist with protecting and securing our systems or services. Any vendor or agent that we retain must comply with our data privacy and security requirements and are not allowed to use personal data they receive from us for any other purpose. Those companies may be located outside of the European Economic Area. Read more in Section 6 “How we share your information”.

<p><strong>3.4. CHILDREN</strong>

<p>We recognise that we have a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from children. We will not knowingly collect Personal Data from any child, or process such information, without parental consent. For the purpose of this Policy, a child means any individual who is under the age of 18 (or the minimum legal age to consent to the collection and processing of Personal Data where this is different under applicable law).

<p><strong>3.5. DATA RETENTION</strong>

<p>We keep most of your Personal Data gathered and processed for the purposes described in this Policy for as long as you continue to use our Services, e.g. you have an activated Account in one of our Games. We will delete your Personal Data after you request your Account deletion and the grace period of 45 (forty-five) calendar days, during which we can restore your Account, expires. The process of erasing your Personal Data can take up to one month from expiry of the grace period and, considering the complexity and number of requests, may be extended by a further two months. Read more in Section 7.3 “Right to erasure”.

<p><strong>3.6. GAMES NOT USING THE ACCOUNT</strong> 

<p>Some of the Games do not use the Account. You will not be able to exercise your rights with regard to those Games through the Account Management. For this reason, we are offering you other tools to export your Personal Data, delete it, and object to our use of your Personal Data in accordance with Section 7 “Your rights”, as well as to manage your subscriptions. 

<p>Also, there are some differences in the Personal Data that we collect about users of the Games for which the Account is created and users of other Games. For example, we do not collect your phone number and email address if you use the Games for which the Account is not created.

<p>With regard to the Games that do not use the Account, you can exercise your rights by filing a request to that effect to Customer Support or as otherwise indicated in the respective Game. 

<p>Finally, you may link some of the Games that do not use the Account to your Account (where such function is available). Please note that control over your Personal Data in such Games is separate from control over your Personal Data relating to your Account. For example, to delete your Personal Data in “World of Warships Blitz” you will need to contact Customer Support as suggested in this Game, while deletion of the Personal Data relating to your Account shall be performed through the Account Management.

<p><strong>4. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong>

<p><strong>4.2.2. Game-Related Information, Device Information, Geo-Location</strong>

<p>In order to provide you with efficient services, we need to collect, store and use various information about your activity in our Games. “<strong>Game-Related Information</strong>” includes your in-game identifier, which for most of our Games is known as “Wargaming ID”, as well as what is usually referred to as “game statistics”. By game statistics we mean information about your Games preferences, progress in the Games, participation in clans, frequency of playing, as well as information about the device you are using the Services on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings. Precise GPS location from mobile devices is collected only with your permission. Wi-Fi and IP addresses received from your browser or device may be used to determine approximate location.

<p><strong>4.2.3. Information required for fraud and violations detection</strong>

<p>We may also collect certain data (like IP address, username, etc.) that is required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. This data is used only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game, and is deleted six months after its collection, unless the data can be used to prove that cheating has occurred. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations. Please note that the specific data stored for this purpose may not be disclosed to you or any third parties, since the disclosure will compromise the mechanism through which we detect, investigate and prevent cheating in the Game, as well as other EULA violations. 

<p><strong>4.2.4. Information from publicly available online resources</strong>

<p>We may use the information made publicly available, e.g. through YouTube, vk.com, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to find out your opinion about Games and Services, so that we could take them into account while improving our Services.

<p><strong>4.2.5. Information from our partners</strong>

<p>In order to fulfil our obligation under the EULA and when processing is required in order to comply with a legal obligation to which we are subject, we may also obtain information about you from our partners, e.g. from our payment and advertising partners. We also use your identifiers on other platforms like PlayStation®4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One, so that you can play our games through these platforms. We only use the data controlled by our partners in accordance with their instructions and applicable laws. When you purchase virtual items, virtual currency (so-called "gold") or time-limited premium memberships with your credit card, we may receive from our payment partners and process a part of your credit card number, information about your credit card issuer, as well as your full address for billing purposes.

<p><strong>5. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>We need to process your Personal Data in order to fulfil the contract with you according to Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. As a user, we will use your Personal Data, unless otherwise prohibited by law, for the following purposes:

<ul>
<li>to provide you with the Services you request; 
<li>to communicate with you about your Account or transactions with us and send you information about features on our Sites or changes to our policies;
<li>to provide support including, but not limited to, product updates, product patches and fixes and other similar communications;
<li>to arrange your travel, receipt of gifts and awards, to which you may be entitled as a result of winning an offline competition, etc.
</ul>

<p><strong>5.1. COMMUNICATION PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We will use your Personal Data for our legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR to notify you and provide you with information about features on our Sites, new product releases and service developments and to advertise our products and services in accordance with this Policy. Namely, once you have created an Account we may use your email address, nickname, IP address, mobile phone number, in order to send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Games. Also, if you opt-in, we will send you emails, messages and targeted in-game and web offers about Wargaming offline events, co-projects of Wargaming and its partners, as well as about Wargaming games, not using Wargaming ID.

<p><strong>5.2. SERVICES IMPROVEMENT PURPOSES</strong>

<p>We analyse the Tracking Data, Content Data and Game-Related Information to identify how to improve the Services and our operations to make them more interesting for our players in general. You are not obligated to respond to polls or surveys and you have choices about the information you provide.

<p><strong>5.3. TARGETED IN-GAME OFFERS</strong>

<p>We may also use the Game-Related Information to send you certain in-game offers that we believe are the most useful to you. To make the offer we first collect Game-Related Information from various players, identify patterns in their behaviour, and create algorithms that identify whether you follow the pattern, if we apply the algorithm and it says that you do actually follow the pattern – we send the in-game offer to you. We make sure that such offers never have any significant impact on you or our other players. For example, we may notice that you are a player who is very good at playing with French vehicles and has registered the account more than five years ago: so, we may specifically offer you the new French vehicle for rent, but in any case not more expensively than it is offered to other users. You can unsubscribe from in-Game offers through our Account Management tool.

<p><strong>5.4. FRAUD AND EULA VIOLATIONS DETECTION</strong>

<p>We use the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and violations of EULA and Game rules and policies only for the purposes of such detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game. If the data can be used to prove that cheating or another fraud or EULA violation has occurred, we will further store the data for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims during the applicable statute of limitations.

<p><strong>6. HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION</strong>

<p>For the performance of a contract with you, compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject, and based on our legitimate interests, we may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties:

<ol>
<li><strong>Payment partners:</strong> we share your email address, IP address, information about in-game purchases requested by you at Wargaming’s web-sites, and other information you provide to us for the purpose of fulfilling your purchase requests with such companies as Adyen BV, PW Inc., PayPal (Europe) Sarl &amp; Cie, "Yandex.Money", NBCO LLC;  
<li><strong>Advertising and advertising measurement partners:</strong> we share your email, nickname, IP address and other information you provide to us in order to facilitate targeting, delivery, and measurement of online advertising on third-party services, or otherwise facilitate transmittal of information that may be useful, relevant, or of interest to you, with such companies as Emarsys UK Ltd, Unity Technologies APS; 
<li><strong>Data storage partners:</strong> we store some of your information using third-party data storage services, e.g. we store most of your responses to our in-game questionnaires using the services of Widgix, LLC dba Survey Gizmo, while some of your game statistics is stored using the services of Amazon Web Services, Inc.; 
<li><strong>Research partners:</strong> we may provide access to some of your data, such as your Game statistics, to provide marketing-related and other research. We share anonymous data with our partners unless your personal data is necessary for the requested services or research;
<li><strong>Customer support partners:</strong> for some territories and products we engage third parties to provide you with appropriate customer support services. Such companies may get access to your personal data, including personal data that you may provide in your customer support requests. Such partners include Zendesk Inc, iOpex Technologies Inc.;
<li><strong>Developers of applications based on the Game:</strong> we make your nickname and some of your Game statistics available to other players and our partners through Public API. The data can be used for developing and support of the applications created by the Game community, mobile applications, e.g. World of Tanks Assistant. Public API enables us to improve your gaming experience, fulfil potential of our community, and put use of our players’ statistics under our control by creating rules and requirements for their use by other players and community;
<li><strong>Publicly available information:</strong> our Sites may also have message boards, forums and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with each other. When posting a message to a board, forum or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line; therefore, you are doing so at your own risk. If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, please use our Account Management tool to request its removal. If we may not be able to remove your personal information promptly, we will let you know about the reasons.
<li><strong>External moderators and testers:</strong> some limited data about you (such as your nickname, content of customer support ticket) may become available to third party volunteering moderators and testers who contribute to providing you with better Services, e.g. to quickly respond to your questions about the Games. 
<li><strong>Anti-cheat and anti-fraud companies:</strong> we may share the information required for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Games and EULA violations only for the purposes of detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game.
<li><strong>Wargaming subsidiaries and affiliates:</strong> as a global company, we collect information that may be processed in our offices worldwide. Your information may also be processed outside of the European Economic Area, e.g. in the United States, the Republic of Belarus, or any other country in which we, our affiliates or subsidiaries maintain presence.
<li><strong>Change of control:</strong> we may share your data as part of our company’s sale, merger or change in control, or in preparation for any of these events. Any entity which buys us, or part of our business will have the right to continue using your data, but only in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy unless you agree otherwise.
</ol>

<p>When your personal data is shared with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as third parties outside the European Union or the European Economic Area, Wargaming guarantees an adequate level of personal data protection, including but not limited to, by entering into standard data protection clauses adopted by the European Commission with Wargaming affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as such third parties. We will provide you with a copy of the standard data protection clauses upon your request.

<p><strong>Sharing anonymous information.</strong> We also may share anonymous information, i.e. information which does not directly or indirectly disclose your identity, and aggregated information (meaning information about groups and categories of users, including game statistics and behaviour, but which does not identify and that cannot reasonably be used to identify any individual user) with our advertising partners. We may also allow our advertisers to collect anonymous information and aggregated information within the Services and they may then share that information with us. Our advertisers may collect this information through the use of tracking technologies like cookies and web beacons. This enables our advertisers to develop and deliver targeted advertising in the Services and on the websites of third parties, so that they can try to serve you with advertisements for products and services that are most likely to be of interest to you. Advertisers will also use this information to monitor, improve or modify their operations.

<p><strong>7. YOUR RIGHTS</strong>

<p>To allow you to exercise your data protection rights in a simple way we have improved the Account Management.  If you are using a demo account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you create the Account <a href="http://wargaming.net/">here</a> or – for Console Games – <a href="https://console.worldoftanks.com/">here</a>. This means that if you are using a demo version of the Account, you will only be able to fully control our use of your data after you complete the Account here.ef="http://wargaming.net/"&gt;here</a>. Please visit it to make choices about which direct communications you would like to receive, as well as to exercise your rights to data access, data erasure and objection to data processing.

<p><strong>7.1. OPT-OUT OF DIRECT MARKETING AND RIGHT TO OBJECT</strong>

<p>You can manage your subscriptions to direct marketing through our Account Management tool. Please note that even if you unsubscribe from all our emails, messages, in-game and web-offers, we may still send you some notifications (we often refer to them as “transactional”), e.g. to confirm purchases or changes in your Account, give warranty or security information, information about changes to the EULA, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We will be able to stop all communications only after your Account is deleted. Also, even after you have unsubscribed from our in-game and web offers, you may still see them within the Games and on some web-sites: that would mean that such offers are shown to everyone and are not specifically directed to you.

<p>You can opt-out of interest-based advertising on mobile applications, including our mobile Games, by checking the privacy settings of your Android or iOS device and selecting "limit ad tracking" (Apple iOS) or "opt-out of interest-based ads" (Android).

<p>Where processing of your Personal Data is based on legitimate interests according to Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, you can use your right to object at any time. If you object we will no longer process your Personal Data unless there are compelling and prevailing legitimate grounds for the processing or the data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. 

<p><strong>7.2. RIGHT OF ACCESS</strong>

<p>You have the right to access your Personal Data that we hold about you, i.e. the right to require free of charge (i) information whether your Personal Data is retained, (ii) access to and/or (iii) duplicates of the Personal Data retained. You can use the right to access to your Personal Data through the “Data Export” tool available in the Account Management tools. Normally, we provide the duplicate of the Personal Data retained within 30 (thirty) days upon your request. Once the archive with the Personal Data we retain is ready, you will be able to download in it from our resources. If the request affects the rights and freedoms of others or is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we reserve the right to charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested) or refuse to act on the request. We also will not be able to provide you with some Personal Data that you may post or provide using our Services regardless of our request not to provide the Personal Data in this particular field, website, etc. 

<p><strong>7.3. RIGHT TO RECTIFICATION</strong>

<p>You control which nickname, email, phone number, country, social networks accounts, trusted sites and payment methods we associate with your Account. If they change, please modify the data in the Personal Account directly. Please inform us if any of the Personal Data we retain about you is inaccurate. 

<p><strong>7.4. RIGHT TO ERASURE</strong>

<p>You have the right to obtain deletion by us of Personal Data concerning you by deleting your Account via our “Account Deletion” tool available in the Account Management tools.

<p>As a result of deleting your Account, you will lose access to most Services, including the Account and Game-Related Information linked to the Account, subscriptions to Wargaming forums and the possibility to access other services you are using the Account for. 

<p><strong>Grace period.</strong> We allow you to restore your Account during a grace period of 45 (forty-five) days from the moment you request deletion of your Account. This functionality allows you not to lose various Game-Related Information and other important information and options by mistake. During the suspension period, we will be able to finalise financial and other activities that you may have initiated before sending the Account deletion request. 

<p><strong>Complicated Account deletion.</strong> In some cases, deletion of your Account, and therefore Personal Data deletion, is complicated. Namely, if you are a clan commander in the Games, it is highly likely that you will only be able to delete your Account after you have transferred the clan and placed it under the command of another user or dissolve the clan. In some cases, considering the complexity and number of the requests, the period for Personal Data erasure may be extended, but for no longer than two further months.

<p><strong>Earlier Personal Data deletion.</strong> We store most Personal Data we retain about you until you request deletion of your Account through the Account Management tools. However, certain Personal Data is deleted even while you have a valid Account. For example, we will delete:

<ul>
<li>your Contact Data, clothes sizes, colour preferences, etc., you have provided for customisation, or for us to send you an award or arrange travel to one of our events, within 30 (thirty) days of us sending the award to your address;
<li>the data about you that we have collected in the course of alpha-tests, super tests, UX tests, surveys, analysis of publicly available sentiments in social networks such as YouTube, Facebook, vk.com for the period when <li>we are generating the reports for our Services improvement and for 30 (thirty) days after that; 
technical logs such as records of communication between Services, access logs, errors logs: normally within 30 (thirty) days from their creation.
</ul>

<p><strong>Information we retain.</strong> Upon expiry of the suspension period we will delete all Personal Data about you, except for the data that are required for our compliance with the requirements of applicable laws (e.g. tax and accounting requirements) or for our detection, investigation and prevention of cheating in the Game and EULA violations. We will retain anonymous information after your Account has been closed. Information you have shared with others (e.g. through in-Games chats, updates or group posts) will remain visible after you closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile or mailbox, and we do not control data that other Members copied out of our Services. Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. Your profile may continue to be displayed in the services of others (e.g. search engine results) until they refresh their cache.

<p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint at a supervisory authority.

<p><strong>8. WE CAN CHANGE THIS POLICY</strong>

<p>We may change this Policy from time to time for various reasons, such as legal and regulatory changes, changes in industry practices and technological developments that need to be reflected.</div>
