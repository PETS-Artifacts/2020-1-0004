            <p id="b4"><b>Confirmation</b></p>
            <p>To confirm a booking, you must be authorised to make the booking by all persons named on the booking and their parent or guardian for all party members who are under 18 when the booking is made. By making the booking, you are confirming that all persons named on the booking accept the Terms and that you will inform the other persons named on the booking of the confirmation details and any other appropriate information. By making the booking you also become responsible for making all payments due under the booking.</p>
            <p>The display of hotel rooms for sale on our Site is an invitation to treat only.</p>
            <p>By clicking the ‘Accept’ button you agree to these Terms. By completing and submitting the booking form you are making an offer to book temporary accommodation room nights, which if accepted by accommodation providers, will result in a binding contract made between you and the accommodation provider.  </p>
            <p>Neither completing the booking process online or making a booking via the telephone constitutes acceptance of your offer.  We will send you an email confirmation following your booking on behalf of the accommodation provider confirming acceptance of your offer and forming the legally binding contract subject to any applicable terms and conditions of these Terms. </p>
            <p>LateRooms will never take payment; the card details requested are simply passed to the accommodation providers to secure and guarantee your booking. Your credit or debit card details may be used by some accommodation providers and/or LateRooms’ sister company, Liberate S.L.U., to carry out pre-authorisation checks.  The details may also then be used by accommodation providers to take advance payment or a cancellation fee or no show fee, if applicable. If you have booked an advance purchase rate, the accommodation provider will be allowed to charge the entire amount of the booking to the credit/debit card upon receiving the confirmation of the booking. We will only ever ask you to provide us with your card details on the secure booking form or directly on the phone to one of our contact centre staff members. You should never email your card details to us. </p>
            <p>Where accommodation providers process your credit or debit card details in connection with the provision of a booking, they will be bound to obtain and maintain any necessary accreditation required to provide payment processing services to you and shall be obliged to operate in accordance with the standards outlined in Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) published on the website www.pcisecuritystandards.org. You acknowledge that the accommodation provider rather than LateRooms is responsible for the security of cardholder data it possesses.</p>
            <p>Where a pre-authorisation check has been attempted and the card details provided are shown to not have sufficient funds, or the pre-authorisation fails for any other reason, the accommodation providers and/or we will attempt to contact you in order that you can provide an alternative method of payment. Should you not respond to our emails within 48 hours accommodation providers reserve the right to cancel your booking and re release your room for re sale </p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to the top</a></p>
            <p id="b5"><b>If you cancel, amend or change a booking</b></p>
            <p>You may modify or cancel your booking at any time prior to your arrival date through the Site or by contacting us via telephone.</p>
            <p>If you cancel or amend your booking, there may be a cancellation charge or amendment fee levied by the accommodation or other service provider. In any event, if you fail to cancel or amend your booking in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation or amendment policy, you will be charged a cancellation or amendment fee by the accommodation or other service provider. Further details of cancellation policy are set out in our email to you confirming your booking and are also shown on the hotel's room details page prior to you making a booking.</p>
            <p>If, for whatsoever reason, you do not turn up at the accommodation on the arrival date stated on your booking confirmation email, without prior warning to LateRooms ("a no show"), this shall be considered a cancellation. Accommodation providers may charge you a cancellation fee using the credit or debit card details that you provided to use when securing your booking, which we then pass on to our accommodation provider partners. </p>
            <p>If you fail to arrive at your accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not tell the accommodation provider in advance, the accommodation provider may cancel the remaining days on your reservation and you may be charged a cancellation fee, please see details in the accommodation providers’ cancellation policy for details.</p>
            <p>The accommodation provider’s cancellation policy will continue to apply even after your arrival at your hotel. So for example, should you decide to shorten the duration of your stay, such a request will be dealt with at the discretion of the accommodation provider, and not by us in our capacity as the booking agent.   If you amend your booking in this way there may be a cancellation fee levied by the accommodation provider and you should refer to the provider’s cancellation policy for more details. </p>
            <p>Where the accommodation provider requires a minimum stay for rooms attracting a certain price, this will be clearly stated on our Site prior to booking. </p>
            <p>Some accommodation providers may also charge additional fees for early check in or late check out. Please check the accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. </p>
            <p>Advanced purchase bookings will attract full pre-payment at the time of booking. This payment and/or bookings cannot be amended, refunded or transferred in the event of cancellation. </p>

            <p>LateRooms takes responsibility for making accessible web content and software seriously.

                <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
                <p>To make a price promise claim, you must fill out the claim form provided on the LateRooms.com website, ensuring that all fields are accurately completed. Failure to provide this information will result in your claim being rejected.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>LateRooms.com's "Price Promise" applies to hotel bookings made directly on LateRooms.com only. It does not apply to any other bookings made on third party websites via LateRooms.com including (but not limited to) cottages, theatre tickets, car hire and other services.</li>
                    <li>As hotel rates can change frequently, claims for any refunds under the Price Promise must be made within 24 hours of completing your hotel room booking through LateRooms.com.</li>
                    <li>The Price Promise only applies in respect of a lower rate for an identical booking that is available from another online booking source (excluding any other LateRooms Group or its affiliate websites) ("Lower Rate"). The Lower Rate must be available and capable of being booked within 24 hours of you completing your booking on LateRooms.com. Screen shots will not be accepted as proof that such Lower Rate is available. LateRooms.com shall be responsible for carrying out checks to ascertain if the Lower Rate is available at the time of validation of your claim.</li>
                    <li>The online Lower Rate must be for an identical booking, this means the same standard of  room at the same hotel as booked through LateRooms.com on the same check-in and check-out dates with the same booking conditions. Claims cannot be made against bookings made or found with "opaque" rates, where the identity of the property isn’t revealed until booking completion or where special advanced purchase rates apply.</li>
                    <li>The Lower Rate must be in the same currency as that booked on LateRooms.com (the local currency that the hotel will charge).</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com will confirm the availability of the Lower Rate within 48 hours of receipt of the claim. In the event that the Lower Rate can be validated your claim shall be approved subject to the remainder of these terms.  In the event that LateRooms.com cannot validate the Lower Rate, your claim will be denied.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com cannot process claims where the hotel booking was made within 24 hours of the check-in date. For hotel bookings that are made over 24 hours before the check-in date, if you cannot cancel your booking, LateRooms.com will still consider your claim if you submit your claim within 24 hours of making the booking: please note however, there may be circumstances where we may not be able to consider and respond to your claim until after your check-in date if the booking is made within 48 hours of the check-in date.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com can only process one claim per booking, any subsequent claims for the same booking will not be processed.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com will only match the difference between its online rate and the Lower Rate if your booking through LateRooms.com is completed and not cancelled or the subject of a "no-show".</li>
                    <li>Following initial approval of a claim, refunds by LateRooms.com will only be made after completion of stay by the claimant at the named hotel for the person named on the booking.. LateRooms.com will verify that the hotel booking in question has been completed without cancellation for the date of the claimed booking. In the event that LateRooms.com is not able to verify that the booking has been completed you will need to post a receipt from the hotel to LateRooms.com as evidence of your completed stay. You may be required to provide additional information in order to be eligible to receive payment.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall use reasonable endeavours to complete a BACS transfer for the amount of the refund within 30 days of receiving confirmation that your stay was completed, provided you have provided us with your bank details on the claim form. No other payment method will be processed.</li>
                    <li>The maximum amount refunded shall not exceed the total value of the original booking made on LateRooms.com. The amount that shall be refunded shall be the difference between the LateRooms.com rate and the approved Lower Rate. The Price Promise only applies to the hotel rate exclusive of tax, when factoring in tax, we do not guarantee that the Laterooms.com rates will be lower than rates provided elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>Whether your claim is successful or not, LateRooms.com’s terms and conditions of booking, including the cancellation policy are still applicable at all times.</li>
                    <li>"Price Promise" does not apply to hotel rooms purchased through or in combination with corporate or convention rates, special discounted rates, membership rates, frequent stay, loyalty points or other "reward" type programs or special promotions of the hotel where the booking is made. Rates must be available to the general public.</li>
                    <li>The Price Promise is only available to UK residents over the age of 18. LateRooms.com will only pay refunds to UK bank accounts on valid claims against bookings made from the UK. Refunds shall be paid in Pounds Sterling only.</li>
                    <li>Employees (including their families and persons residing in the same household) of LateRooms.com’s hotel partners are not eligible. Previously cancelled or refunded bookings are also not eligible.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions and/or end the Price Promise offer at any time and without notice.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall make the final determination regarding your refund eligibility and the availability of a Lower Rate.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall not be liable for the payment of any refunds under the Price Promise with respect to rates loaded in error by LateRooms.com or any vendor or any printing, typographical, administrative or technological errors in any materials relating to the Price Promise.</li>
                    <li>In the event of any dispute regarding the Price Promise and/or any subsequent claims, the decisions of LateRooms.com shall be final and binding on all parties.</li>
                    <li>By submitting a claim form you acknowledge, agree and accept these terms and conditions.</li>
                    <li>The Price Promise and these terms and conditions are governed by English law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.</li>
