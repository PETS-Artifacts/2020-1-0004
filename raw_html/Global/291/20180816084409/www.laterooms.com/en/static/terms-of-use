                <p>COTS (UK) /CRIBS (US) - please advise at the time of booking if you require a cot or crib, in order that this information is given to the accommodation provider. We cannot guarantee this request will be met. Such requests will be subject to availability and if the accommodation is unable to meet any such request, neither LateRooms, nor the accommodation, will have any liability to you in this respect. This request may only be available at an additional cost unless otherwise expressly stated in the description of the accommodation provider, and if any additional cost is applicable this should be paid by you direct to the accommodation provider.</p>
                <p><b>Special access requirements:</b></p>
                <p>If you have special requirements, such as needing a room with wheelchair access, please contact us before making your booking so that we can ensure that your needs can be meet. Please note that all such special requests are subject to availability and LateRooms cannot guarantee that all accommodation providers will be able to meet your needs. Once you have booked your accommodation, depending on the cancellation policy of the applicable accommodation provider, your booking may be refunded, cancelled, modified or you may be offered alternative accommodation if your request cannot be met. </p>
                <p><b>Price promise:</b></p>
                <p>LateRooms also offer all of our customers a price promise should you find the same accommodation available elsewhere for a cheaper rate.

                <p id="b4"><b>Confirmation</b></p>
                <p>To confirm a booking, you must be authorised to make the booking by all persons named on the booking and their parent or guardian for all party members who are under 18 when the booking is made. By making the booking, you are confirming that all persons named on the booking accept the Terms and that you will inform the other persons named on the booking of the confirmation details and any other appropriate information. By making the booking you also become responsible for making all payments due under the booking.</p>
                <p>The display of hotel rooms for sale on our Site is an invitation to treat only.</p>
                <p>By clicking the ‘Accept’ button you agree to these Terms. By completing and submitting the booking form you are making an offer to book temporary accommodation room nights, which if accepted by accommodation providers, will result in a binding contract made between you and the accommodation provider.  </p>
                <p>Neither completing the booking process or otherwise placing a booking constitutes acceptance of your offer on our behalf.  We will send you an email confirmation following your booking on behalf of the accommodation provider confirming acceptance of your offer and forming the legally binding contract subject to any applicable terms and conditions of these Terms. </p>
                <p>LateRooms will never take payment; the card details requested are simply passed to the accommodation providers to secure and guarantee your booking. Your credit or debit card details may be used by some accommodation providers to carry out pre-authorisation checks.  The details may also then be used by accommodation providers to take advance payment or a cancellation fee or no show fee, if applicable. If you have booked an advance purchase rate, the accommodation provider will be allowed to charge the entire amount of the booking to the credit/debit card upon receiving the confirmation of the booking. We will only ever ask you to provide us with your card details in a secure environment. You should never email your card details to us. </p>
                <p>Where accommodation providers process your credit or debit card details in connection with the provision of a booking, they will be bound to obtain and maintain any necessary accreditation required to provide payment processing services to you and shall be obliged to operate in accordance with the standards outlined in Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) published on the website www.pcisecuritystandards.org. You acknowledge that the accommodation provider rather than LateRooms is responsible for the security of cardholder data it possesses.</p>
                <p>Where a pre-authorisation check has been attempted and the card details provided are shown to not have sufficient funds, or the pre-authorisation fails for any other reason, the accommodation providers and/or we will attempt to contact you in order that you can provide an alternative method of payment. Should you not respond to our emails within 48 hours accommodation providers reserve the right to cancel your booking and release your room for re-sale </p>

                <p id="b5"><b>If you cancel, amend or change a booking</b></p>
                <p>You may modify or cancel your booking at any time prior to your arrival date through the Site.</p>
                <p>If you cancel or amend your booking, there may be a cancellation charge or amendment fee levied by the accommodation or other service provider. In any event, if you fail to cancel or amend your booking in accordance with the accommodation provider's cancellation or amendment policy, you will be charged a cancellation or amendment fee by the accommodation or other service provider. Further details of cancellation policy are set out in our email to you confirming your booking and are also shown on the hotel's room details page prior to you making a booking.</p>
                <p>If, for whatsoever reason, you do not turn up at the accommodation on the arrival date stated on your booking confirmation email, without prior warning to LateRooms ("a no show"), this shall be considered a cancellation. Accommodation providers may charge you a cancellation fee using the credit or debit card details that you provided to use when securing your booking, which we then pass on to our accommodation provider partners. </p>
                <p>If you fail to arrive at your accommodation on time on the day of your reservation and do not tell the accommodation provider in advance, the accommodation provider may cancel the remaining days on your reservation and you may be charged a cancellation fee, please see details in the accommodation providers’ cancellation policy for details.</p>
                <p>The accommodation provider’s cancellation policy will continue to apply even after your arrival at your hotel. So for example, should you decide to shorten the duration of your stay, such a request will be dealt with at the discretion of the accommodation provider, and not by us in our capacity as the booking agent.   If you amend your booking in this way there may be a cancellation fee levied by the accommodation provider and you should refer to the provider’s cancellation policy for more details. </p>
                <p>Where the accommodation provider requires a minimum stay for rooms attracting a certain price, this will be clearly stated on our Site prior to booking. </p>
                <p>Some accommodation providers may also charge additional fees for early check in or late check out. Please check the accommodation details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. </p>
                <p>Advanced purchase bookings will attract full pre-payment at the time of booking. This payment and/or bookings cannot be amended, refunded or transferred in the event of cancellation. </p>

                    We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; or to take steps to enter you into a contract with a third party;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data other than in relation to sending direct marketing communications to you via email or text message, and where we send you third party marketing communications. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by <a href="#p1">contacting us</a>.
                </p>
                <p><b>Purposes for which we will use your personal data</b></p>

                    We have set out below, in a table format, a description of all the ways we plan to use your personal data, and which of the legal bases we rely on to do so. We have also identified what our legitimate interests are where appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Note that we may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your data.

                <p>
                    Many of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (<b>EEA</b>) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.

                <p> For all other transfers unrelated to the provision of accommodation/travel services to you, whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>

                        We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>  Please <a href="#p1">contact us</a> if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.</p>
                <h3 id="p7">7. Data Security</h3>
                <p>
                    We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.   
                </p>
                <h3 id="p8">8. Data Retention</h3>
                <p><b>How long will you use my personal data for?</b></p>
                <p>
                    We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years plus current after they cease being customers for legal and tax purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="#p10-11">Request erasure</a> below for further information.
                </p>
                <p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you. </p>
                <h3 id="p9">9. Your legal rights</h3>

                <p>
                    You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

                <p><b>What we may need from you</b></p>
                <p>
                    We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
                </p>
                <p><b>Time limit to respond</b></p>
                <p>
                    We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

                    <li id="p10-9"><b>Request access</b> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</li>
                    <li id="p10-10"><b>Request correction</b> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</li>
                    <li id="p10-11"><b>Request erasure</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</li>
                    <li id="p10-12"><b>Object to processing</b> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</li>
                    <li id="p10-13"><b>Request restriction of processing</b> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</li>
                    <li id="p10-14"><b>Request the transfer</b> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.

                    <li id="p10-15"><b>Withdraw consent at any time</b> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

                    <li>The Price Promise only applies in respect of a lower rate for an identical booking that is available from another online booking source (excluding any other LateRooms Group or its affiliate websites) ("Lower Rate"). The Lower Rate must be available and capable of being booked within 24 hours of you completing your booking on LateRooms.com. Screen shots will not be accepted as proof that such Lower Rate is available. LateRooms.com shall be responsible for carrying out checks to ascertain if the Lower Rate is available at the time of validation of your claim.</li>
                    <li>The online Lower Rate must be for an identical booking, this means the same standard of  room at the same hotel as booked through LateRooms.com on the same check-in and check-out dates with the same booking conditions. Claims cannot be made against bookings made or found with "opaque" rates, where the identity of the property isn’t revealed until booking completion or where special advanced purchase rates apply.</li>
                    <li>The Lower Rate must be in the same currency as that booked on LateRooms.com (the local currency that the hotel will charge).</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com will confirm the availability of the Lower Rate within 48 hours of receipt of the claim. In the event that the Lower Rate can be validated your claim shall be approved subject to the remainder of these terms.  In the event that LateRooms.com cannot validate the Lower Rate, your claim will be denied.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com cannot process claims where the hotel booking was made within 24 hours of the check-in date. For hotel bookings that are made over 24 hours before the check-in date, if you cannot cancel your booking, LateRooms.com will still consider your claim if you submit your claim within 24 hours of making the booking: please note however, there may be circumstances where we may not be able to consider and respond to your claim until after your check-in date if the booking is made within 48 hours of the check-in date.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com can only process one claim per booking, any subsequent claims for the same booking will not be processed.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com will only match the difference between its online rate and the Lower Rate if your booking through LateRooms.com is completed and not cancelled or the subject of a "no-show".</li>
                    <li>Following initial approval of a claim, refunds by LateRooms.com will only be made after completion of stay by the claimant at the named hotel for the person named on the booking.. LateRooms.com will verify that the hotel booking in question has been completed without cancellation for the date of the claimed booking. In the event that LateRooms.com is not able to verify that the booking has been completed you will need to post a receipt from the hotel to LateRooms.com as evidence of your completed stay. You may be required to provide additional information in order to be eligible to receive payment.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall use reasonable endeavours to complete a BACS transfer for the amount of the refund within 30 days of receiving confirmation that your stay was completed, provided you have provided us with your bank details on the claim form. No other payment method will be processed.</li>
                    <li>The maximum amount refunded shall not exceed the total value of the original booking made on LateRooms.com. The amount that shall be refunded shall be the difference between the LateRooms.com rate and the approved Lower Rate. The Price Promise only applies to the hotel rate exclusive of tax, when factoring in tax, we do not guarantee that the Laterooms.com rates will be lower than rates provided elsewhere.</li>
                    <li>Whether your claim is successful or not, LateRooms.com’s terms and conditions of booking, including the cancellation policy are still applicable at all times.</li>
                    <li>"Price Promise" does not apply to hotel rooms purchased through or in combination with corporate or convention rates, special discounted rates, membership rates, frequent stay, loyalty points or other "reward" type programs or special promotions of the hotel where the booking is made. Rates must be available to the general public.</li>
                    <li>The Price Promise is only available to UK residents over the age of 18. LateRooms.com will only pay refunds to UK bank accounts on valid claims against bookings made from the UK. Refunds shall be paid in Pounds Sterling only.</li>
                    <li>Employees (including their families and persons residing in the same household) of LateRooms.com’s hotel partners are not eligible. Previously cancelled or refunded bookings are also not eligible.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com reserves the right to modify these terms and conditions and/or end the Price Promise offer at any time and without notice.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall make the final determination regarding your refund eligibility and the availability of a Lower Rate.</li>
                    <li>LateRooms.com shall not be liable for the payment of any refunds under the Price Promise with respect to rates loaded in error by LateRooms.com or any vendor or any printing, typographical, administrative or technological errors in any materials relating to the Price Promise.</li>
                    <li>In the event of any dispute regarding the Price Promise and/or any subsequent claims, the decisions of LateRooms.com shall be final and binding on all parties.</li>
                    <li>By submitting a claim form you acknowledge, agree and accept these terms and conditions.</li>
                    <li>The Price Promise and these terms and conditions are governed by English law and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts.</li>
