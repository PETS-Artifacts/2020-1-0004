<section id="where-we-store-data">
<h3>Where we store your personal data</h3>
<p>Our operations are supported by a network of computers, servers, and other infrastructure and information technology, including, but not limited to, third-party service providers. We and our third-party service providers store and process your personal data in the European Union, Japan, Singapore, the United States of America, and elsewhere in the world.</p>
</section>
<section id="sharing-data-outside-of-eea">
<h3>Sharing your data outside of the EEA</h3>
<p>In order to provide our Services to you, it is sometimes necessary for us to transfer your data to the third parties outlined in section 7.1 that are based outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA"). In these cases, we ensure that both ourselves and our partners take adequate and appropriate technical, physical, and organizational security measures to protect your data. We also ensure we have appropriate contractual protections in place with these third parties.</p>
<p>By using Payward Services, you consent to your Personal Data being transferred to other countries, including countries that have different data protection rules than your country. In all such transfers, we will protect your personal information as described in this Privacy Notice and in a manner consistent with the principles of the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield framework. For more information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@kraken.com">support@kraken.com</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="profiling-and-automated">
<h3>Profiling and automated decision making</h3>
<p>We may in some instances use your personal data, such as your country of residence and trade history, in order to better address your needs. For example, if you frequently trade in a specific virtual currency, we may use this information to inform you of new product updates or features that may be useful for you. When we do this, we take all necessary measures to ensure that your privacy and security are protected, and we only use anonymous or de-identified data.</p>
<p>We may use Automated Decision Making (ADM) in order to improve your experience, or to help fight financial crime. For example, so that we can provide you with a fast and efficient service, we may use ADM to verify your identity documents, or to confirm the accuracy of the information you have provided to us. None of our ADM processes have a legal effect on you.</p>
</section>
<section id="privacy-and-blockchain">
<h3>Privacy when using digital assets and blockchains</h3>
<p>Your funding of bitcoin, XRP, ether, and other Digital Assets, may be recorded on a public blockchain. Public blockchains are distributed ledgers, intended to immutably record transactions across wide networks of computer systems. Many blockchains are open to forensic analysis which can lead to deanonymization and the unintentional revelation of private financial information, especially when blockchain data is combined with other data.</p>
<p>Because blockchains are decentralized or third-party networks which are not controlled or operated by Payward or its affiliates, we are not able to erase, modify, or alter personal data from such networks.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-retention">
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>As Payward and its affiliates are subject to various legal, compliance and reporting obligations, including BSA or national AML requirements (as defined above), we are required by law to store some of your personal and transactional data beyond the closure of your account with us. Your data is only accessed internally on a need to know basis, and it will only be accessed or processed if absolutely necessary. We will delete data that is no longer required by any relevant law or jurisdiction in which we operate.</p>
</section>
<section id="cookies">
<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>When you use Kraken Exchange Services, we may make use of the standard practice of placing tiny data files called cookies, flash cookies, pixel tags, or other tracking tools (herein, “Cookies”) on your computer or other devices used to visit Kraken Exchange Services. We use Cookies to (i) help us recognize you as a customer, collect information about your use of Kraken Exchange Services to better customize our services and content for you, and to collect information about your computer or other access devices as part to ensure our compliance with our BSA and AML obligations and (ii) ensure that your account security has not been compromised by detecting irregular or suspicious account activities.</p>
