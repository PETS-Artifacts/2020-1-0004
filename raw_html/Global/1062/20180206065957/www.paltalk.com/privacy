The Services provide a range of video, audio, instant messaging and other networking and discussion services. Any Snap owned services linked to other privacy policies are governed by that service’s privacy policy. Snap provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue to use the Services and the choices we offer for you to manage the information we collect related to the use of the Services. Our goal is to collect and use only that information that we believe is required for our legitimate business interests, to better understand your interests and to improve your experience using the Services.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">Each time that you access or use the Services, you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, by reference and subject, the Terms of Service found at <a href="http://www.paltalk.com/terms"><u>http://www.paltalk.com/terms</u></a> (“Terms”).</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong><em>Account and Profile Information You Provide to Us</em></strong>. We will collect personal information from you when you sign up for any of our Services, interact with our Services, create or update your account or profile, interact with other users, or communicate directly with us. For example, account information may include name, date of birth, email address, physical address, and mobile number. Profile information may include your nickname, gender, current city, interests, videos, photos, ethnicity, age and any other information you choose to provide in your profile. Profile information is public and will be made available to other users. We will not disclose your account information to other users.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">When you create an account, you may be asked to provide us with certain additional information such as username and password. In connection with signing up for a subscription service or purchasing Virtual Gifts and Stickers, you may also provide payment information such as credit or debit card information, and billing name and address.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong><em>Your Imported Profile from Social Networks</em>.</strong> When using our Services and any applicable third party social networking services such as Facebook (a “Social Network”), you may have the option to consent to connecting your profile or activity on our Services with your Social Network information and activity. If you choose to use our Social Network populating feature to create an account, we may import information for your account or profile on our Services from a Social Network. We only import from the information you allow to be imported from the Social Network, which is controlled by your privacy settings on that Social Network (“Permitted Social Network Content”). The authentication of your Social Network login credentials is conducted solely by the Social Network. If you use this feature, we initially create your profile by displaying your first name as the user name displayed to other users, gender, current city, interests, about me, photos, and age (which is calculated from your birthdate). With your permission, we may also combine that information with your public social media profile (which may include your friend list, birthday, work history, interests, current city, photos, personal description and likes). Please review the Social Network’s privacy policy and choices for sharing information with our Services.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">By associating your Social Network account with our Services and authorizing us to have access to this information, you agree that we may collect, use, and store Permitted Social Network Content across all our Services and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong><em>Surveys and Promotions</em>.</strong> From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys, contests or sweepstakes. Participation is completely voluntary. Information collected in any sweepstakes or contest may be used as set forth in this policy and as described in the official rules, such as to notify the winners, award prizes and file winners’ information, as required by law. Survey information will be used for the purposes of the survey.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong><em>Information You Post</em>.</strong> The Services are designed to enable you to communicate with other users through interactive forums, and any information or content you post when participating in the Services becomes public information, and is subject to redistribution by Snap and other third parties. There is no expectation of privacy when posting a profile or otherwise participating in the Services and we have no control over how users may use the information you make public. Therefore, you should exercise caution and discretion when deciding to disclose your personal information. It is possible that your profile information may become available through internet search crawlers; we therefore encourage you not to disclose any information that you may not want to make public.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong><em>Mobile Information</em>.</strong> We may collect additional information from you if you access the Services through a mobile device, such as your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, regional location or, with your permission, precise geo-location. Please note that the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) (“Device”) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, Wi-Fi, etc.).</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><em><strong>Information About Others/Inviting Friends.</strong> </em>You may have the option to choose to submit personal information about other people to invite them to join the Services. Inviting friends is optional and you should have prior permission to contact other people through the Services. Please be aware that if you use any send-to-a-friend functionality on the Services, your email address may be included in the communication sent to your friend.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt"><strong>2. <a name="Section 2" id="Section 2">INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</a></strong></p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">We and our business partners may use a variety of tracking technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information from your Devices whenever you visit or interact with the Services or third party websites (“Tracking Technologies”). For a current list of tracking technologies used <a href="#Tracking Technologies">click here</a>. Tracking Technologies are used for a variety of purposes, including:</p><ul><li>Operationally Necessary.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">We may use Tracking Technologies for system administration, to prevent fraudulent activity, to improve security or to allow you to make use of our Services.</p><ul><li>Performance Related.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">We may use Tracking Technologies to assess the performance of our Services, including as part of our analytics practices to improve content offered through the Services. For example, we may use these tools to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, time spent on certain pages and page interaction information. We may also use Tracking Technologies to tell us whether you have visited the Services before or if you are a new visitor and to help us identify the features in which you may have the greatest interest. We may also collect information about the website you visited before you came to our Services and the website you visited after you leave our Services, if this information is supplied by your browser. We use Google to serve first party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services, are related to visits to the Services. To learn about Google Analytics opt-outs for the web or mobile, <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">click here</a>. To learn more about our other analytics providers’ data collection practices, <a href="#Analytics Providers">click here</a>.</p><ul><li>Targeting Related.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on the Services and third party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content, and to track the content you access.</p><ul><li>Tracking Your Activities Across Devices and Apps.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">To better understand your purchasing preferences, we may also use third party vendors that provide tracking tools that recognize and collect usage and interest information across the sites you’ve visited from your various Devices. When you visit the Services on a specific Device, a unique ID is created for that Device which may be based on your hashed (de-identified) email address. This allows us and our third party vendors to deliver relevant product recommendations, personalized content and advertising to you based on your interests gathered across multiple sites. This data may be combined with the same information from another browser or Device if you use multiple browsers or Devices. Third party tracking tools might also obtain information about other applications that you have downloaded to your mobile Device, the websites you visit and other information about you or your Device in order to analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising on the Services and elsewhere.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">Completing the opt-out process on one Device will not cause you to be opted out of targeted advertising collection and use on other Devices attributed to you or your family. Your choice of “do not track” must be exercised on each Device separately.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">Mobile app opt-outs do not affect cookie-based data, while browser-based opt-outs do not affect mobile app and cross-app data. Also, mobile app opt-outs are limited to a specific Device, while browser-based opt-outs are limited to a specific browser. In addition, choice mechanisms may be presented to you, as you move about the web, but they will be limited to the companies participating in any particular program.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">The use of Tracking Technologies by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies and is not covered by this Policy. Please visit our <a href="#Analytics Providers">Analytics Providers</a> page at the back of this policy for a list of service providers we use and your opt-out options.</p><ul><li><a id="Interest Based Advertising" name="Interest Based Advertising">Interest-based Advertising</a>.</li></ul><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">We or our advertising partners may use Tracking Technologies to collect Information about your visits over time and across the Services and other third-party web sites, and combine that information with other information received from other sources, in order to serve more targeted advertising to you. For example, we use Google interest based cookies to serve personalized ads to you. Our ad partners automatically receive your IP address or Device identifier when this happens. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same ad and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. These third parties may also use information gathered from your use of the Services to serve targeted, interest based advertisements from other advertisers to you on third-party websites and applications.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">To opt-out of Google interest based cookies, <a href="https://adssettings.google.com/u/0/authenticated">click here</a>. <a href="#Analytics Providers">Click here</a> to opt-out of some of our other advertising service providers' interest based cookies.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">The Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) has also made available for consumers tools on which you can register your choices not to be tracked by participating advertising networks or companies in the collection and use of your online activities. These are (1) The DAA <a href="http://www.aboutadsd.info/choices/">Consumer Choice Page for Mobile Web </a>(at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ </a>) and (2) DAA <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">AppChoices </a>(at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices">http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices</a>), which is a mobile app that allows you to opt out of the collection and use of cross-app data, other than for permitted uses, by listed third-party AppChoices participants. You may opt out of mobile-app targeted advertising ads from any or all of the listed participating advertising networks. You can download the free mobile app from an app store available on your mobile platform. When you opt out with a particular participating advertising network, the mobile app adds your device identifier to that participant’s opt-out list. The participant advertising network is then notified to block the device identifiers on the opt-out list.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">You can also prevent your receipt of interest-based ads on websites by deleting and declining cookies in your browser(s). Note that your opt-out choice is applied only to the browser from which you make the choice.</p><p style="margin-left:5.0pt">Some newer mobile device operating systems allow you to limit the use of information to deliver interest-based advertising in mobile applications, or your mobile web browser may provide a “Do Not Track” browser setting which will notify those ad servers and networks who recognize the signals to refrain from sending you interest based ads to your mobile device.
