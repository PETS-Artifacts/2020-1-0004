	<p>To better protect your personal information we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  It applies to all information you submit, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and credit card number.  We use the information you provide when placing an order to complete that order, and when assisting with support issues.  We may also contact you from time to time with product updates, links to free downloads, and other product information that we think may be of interest to you.

Because this information is important to your interaction with Olive Tree, you may not opt out of receiving these communications.  You can review information about you that we have collected online and maintain by writing us at support@olivetree.com.  You can also call to request factual correction in your information.

	<p>10. THIRD PARTY CONTENT.  The Site may contain content or links to various third party web sites and other resources ("<b>Third Party Content</b>"). This Third Party Content (e.g. other than www.OliveTree.com) is not under the control of Olive Tree and Olive Tree is not responsible or liable for the content, communications or materials of any Third Party Content. Olive Tree, if applicable, provides this content or links to you as a convenience only.  The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Olive Tree of the Third Party Content or any association with its operators.  You are responsible for adhering to the applicable terms of use for any Third Party Content. You are solely responsible and liable for any interactions you may have with such entities, their sponsors and other third parties.  On some rare circumstances, it may be necessary ? by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental authorities within or outside your country of residence ? for Olive Tree to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.

Olive Tree's failure at any time to require strict performance by you or any other licensees of any of the provisions of this agreement does not waive Olive Tree's right to thereafter require strict compliance with any provisions of this agreement.  If a court of competent jurisdiction determines, in a final non-appealable judgment, that any provision of this agreement is invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be deleted and the remainder of the agreement will be enforced as nearly as possible in accordance with the stated intention of the parties.

In the event of a material change to this Agreement we will also use reasonable efforts to notify you by sending notice to the email address that you have provided to us.  If any modification is unacceptable to you, you agree that your only recourse is to immediately terminate your use of the Site and related services.  Your continued use of the Site and related services following our posting of a change of terms notice will constitute your binding acceptance of the change.  YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT INDICATES THAT YOU GIVE CONSENT TO OLIVE TREE TO SEND AN E-MAIL COMMUNICATION TO YOU WITH NOTICES CONCERNING MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE PRODUCT(S) OR THE SERVICES TO WHICH YOU HAVE SUBSCRIBED.</p>
