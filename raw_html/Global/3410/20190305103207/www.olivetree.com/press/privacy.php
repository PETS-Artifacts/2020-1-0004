    <h4 id="h2"><i>Information Obtained by Automated Means Through Our Services</i></h4>
    <p>We also may obtain certain information through our Services by automated means, such as cookies (including HTTP, HTML5 and Flash cookies), web beacons, web server logs, JavaScript and similar technologies, including technologies designed to obtain information regarding your use of our Services. The information we obtain in this manner may include IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, information on actions taken on our Services, and dates and times you access or use the Services. In connection with our mobile apps, we also may obtain your phone number and details about your mobile carrier.</p>
    <p>A “cookie” is a file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other Internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. A “web beacon” also known as an Internet tag, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies and may be used to transmit information collected through cookies back to a web server. Through these automated collection methods, we obtain “clickstream data,” which is a log of the links and other content on which a visitor clicks while browsing a website. As the visitor clicks through the website, a record of the action may be collected and stored. We also may use similar automated means to obtain and store information regarding your actions while using our mobile apps.</p>
    <p>We may link certain data elements obtained through automated means, such as your browser or device information, with other information we have obtained about you to let us know, for example, whether you have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Services or on third-party websites and apps. Your browser may tell you how to be notified when you receive certain types of cookies or how to restrict or disable certain types of cookies. You also may be able to delete your Flash cookies or adjust your Flash cookie settings by visiting the Adobe Flash <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html" target="_blank" title="Website Storage Settings Panel">Website Storage Settings Panel</a> and <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html" target="_blank" title="Global Storage Settings Panel">Global Storage Settings Panel</a>. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to use all of the features of our Services. Your device settings also may allow you to prohibit mobile app platforms (such as Apple and Google) from sharing certain information obtained by automated means with us through our apps or other app developers.</p>
    <p>In addition, if you register with us through or connect your account with us to a third-party social media network (such as Facebook, Google, or Twitter), we may obtain certain information about you from the relevant social media network, such as your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media network, the information contained in your public profile on the social media network and friends lists. The specific information we obtain depends on your privacy settings on the applicable social media network.</p>
    <p>The providers of third-party apps, tools, widgets and plug-ins on our Services, such as social media sharing tools, also may use automated means to collect information regarding your interactions with these features. This information is collected directly by the providers of those features and is subject to the privacy policies or notices of those providers. The Company is not responsible for those providers’ information practices.</p>

	<h2 id="cc">CREDIT CARD PROTECTION POLICY</h2>
	<p>At Olive Tree, we want you to feel safe and secure when you provide us with your personal information online. For this reason we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt your credit card and other sensitive information when you make product purchases or request technical assistance. The process of encryption minimizes the possibility of unauthorized individuals from viewing your information as it is securely transmitted over the Internet. Once received, your credit card information is not transmitted over the Internet again.  However, even with such protection policies and safeguard procedures in place, there is always the possibility of fraud occurring. If you believe unauthorized disclosure or use of your credit information has occurred, please follow the reporting procedures defined by your credit card's issuing bank and contact us immediately.  Most credit card companies cover all charges that result form unauthorized use of your credit card or may limit your liability to $50.</p>

The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort. Regardless of the choice of laws, any action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought in the state or federal courts located in Spokane, Washington, and each party irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of such courts. If either party employs attorneys to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this EULA, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, costs and other expenses. </p>
	<p> 19. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; NO WAIVER; SEVERABILITY.

Olive Tree's failure at any time to require strict performance by you or any other licensees of any of the provisions of this EULA does not waive Olive Tree's right to thereafter require strict compliance with any provisions of this EULA. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines, in a final non-appealable judgment, that any provision of this EULA is invalid, illegal, or otherwise unenforceable, such provision will be deleted and the remainder of the EULA will be enforced as nearly as possible in accordance with the stated intention of the parties.
