We have a legitimate interest in processing your personal data for these purposes (as we cannot provide certain services without having the ability to communicate with you in this way) and so if you do not wish for us to contact you about such matters then you will need to delete your account (please note that you will then be unable to use those features of the Website or services which require you to be a registered user).</p><h2>DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION</h2><p>We may disclose your personal information to third parties:</p><ul><li>in order to:<ul><li>enforce or apply the Terms of Use and other agreements or to investigate potential breaches of the same; and/or</li><li>protect the rights, property or safety of Patient, our customers, or others;</li></ul></li><li>if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal or regulatory obligation or request;</li><li>if it is to a third party performing services on our behalf (and who may only use such information to provide services that we have requested and not for any other purpose), for example, third party companies that provide analytical services so that we can better understand our users and so tailor the services that we provide;</li><li>in connection with a potential sale or transfer of part or all of our business. In such circumstances we may share information with prospective purchasers (for example as part of a controlled due diligence exercise); and/or</li><li>if we reorganise our business as we may need to transfer information about you to another member of our group of companies so that we could continue to provide services to you.</li></ul><h2>HOW AND WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2><p>The personal data that we collect from you will be processed (which may incude, where relevant, storing it) in accordance with our obligations under the relevant laws which set out our obligations as someone that has personal data within our possession and control (typically referred to as a ‘data controller’).</p><p>We will retain a record of your personal data in accordance with relevant law and the following criteria:</p><ul><li>where we have a reasonable business need to do so, for example, in order to manage our relationship with you;</li><li>where we are providing products and/or services to you and then for as long as someone could bring a claim against us in respect of those products or services; and/or</li><li>in line with any legal and regulatory requirements or guidance in respect of retention periods.</li></ul><p>As noted above, We sometimes we use other organisations to process your personal information on our behalf, for example, in relation to the feedback surveys on our Website. We may use service providers to help us run the Website or services available on the Website, some of whom may be based outside the EEA. However, it is our responsibility to ensure that if we use any such service provider then we will ensure that we have the necessary safeguards in place. We may also independently audit these service providers to ensure that they meet our standards.</p><p>Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of any data transmitted to the Website; any transmission that you make is therefore made at your own risk. However, once we have received your data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent any unauthorised or unlawful access to the same and all information you provide to us is held at our offices, (where relevant) those of other members of our group of companies, third party agencies, service providers, representatives and agents as described above. We also hold your personal data in secure data centres in the UK with all reasonable technological and operational measures put in place to safeguard it from unauthorised access.</p><p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password that enables you to access certain parts of our Website or services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password information with anyone.</p><p><strong>Third party sites and links</strong></p><p>Our Website may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers or other third parties (for example, we include links below to the site of the Information Commissioner’s Office).</p><p>If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites and any services that may be accessible through them will have their own privacy notices, policies and terms of use and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for the same (and how they may be applied) or for any personal data that may be collected through those third party websites or services, such as contact and location data. Please check the relevant third party terms, notices and policies before you provide any personal data to those websites or use their services.</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>We are committed to protecting the privacy of children.

Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.</p><p><strong>Your rights</strong></p><p>You have a number of important legal rights regarding the manner in which personal data relating to you is used.
