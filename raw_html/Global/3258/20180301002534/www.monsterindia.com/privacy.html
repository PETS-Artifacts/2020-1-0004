          Monster is a career site; we retain your personal information to  assist in your career performance or management including finding or retaining  work; or to facilitate other services to or by us.<br>
          <br>
          For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a  contest, or purchase a product, we collect more specific personal information  about you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number,  qualifications or career history.<br>
          <br>
          If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive information  about you such as information about your membership in a professional or trade  association or trade union.<br>
          <br>
          We may also ask you for other information, such as information  on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the Web Site, the types of  jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you the best  possible Web Site experience. When you grant us your permission, we will  communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey information on  using the Monster Web Site to maximize your career development. Monster also  provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications.  If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of  registration, but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log  in to your My Monster account and edit your account profile.<br>
          <br>
          If you input your information on a co-branded registration page,  such as that of a Monster and partner company-sponsored contest, then your  information will be collected, used and becomes the property of both Monster  and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Monster is not  responsible for the information that the partner company receives or how it is  used.<br><br>

          If you do not provide us with the information sought in the  required fields Monster may be limited in its ability to provide you with  services.<br><br>

          <strong>Use and Disclosure of the Information we collect</strong><br><br>

          We use the information we gather on the Web Site, whether  personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purposes of operating  and improving the Web Site, fostering a positive user experience, and  delivering the products and services that we offer.<br><br>

          If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also use  the information we gather to inform you of other products or services available  from us or our affiliated companies or to contact you about your opinion of  current products and services or potential new products and services that may  be offered.<br><br>

          We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail  or other communications regarding updates at the Web Site to contact you about  your opinion of current products and services or potential new products and  services that may be offered. We may also provide additional communications,  promotions and information on new Monster opportunities, and additional job  postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and frequency of these  messages will vary depending upon the information we have about you.<br><br>

          In addition, at the time of registration for an account, you  have the option to elect or not elect to receive additional communications,  information and promotions, including without limitation, free informational  newsletters from us relating to topics that may be of special interest to you,  such as career management advice.<br><br>

          Monster cannot ensure that all of your private communications  and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise  described in this Privacy Commitment. Therefore, although we are committed to  protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that  your personal information or private communications will always remain private.  As a user of the Web Site, you understand and agree that you assume all  responsibility and risk for your use of the Web Site, the internet generally,  and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Web  Site.<br><br>

          <strong>Disclosure of Information to Others</strong><br><br>

        We disclose to third parties within your country and abroad your  personal information, combined personal, demographic, behavioral or indirect  information, as set forth below:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
          <li>We disclose your resume to employers who have posted       job opportunities that may be of interest to you on the Web Site when you       apply for those jobs.</li>
             <li>We may share your information with third parties who       help us in the delivery of our own products and services to you. We       disclose information to companies and individuals we employ to perform       functions on our behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers,       analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card       payments, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals       may be located in a country, whose data protection legislation is       different from your country, and they will have access to your personal       information as necessary to perform their functions, but they may not       share that information with any other third party or use that data for any       other purpose. We will remain responsible for any information shared in       this way.</li>
             <li>We may disclose such information to third parties if       you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you make your resume       searchable, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database       (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. If you indicate by       configuring your profile that you would like to receive information about       the opportunities, products or services of third parties, we supply your       contact information to select third parties such as employers, recruiters,       data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you       e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you       (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine       whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services       of a particular third party. For example, if you indicate that you would       like to receive information about the opportunities, products or services       of third parties at the time you register for a Monster account, we supply       your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters,       data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you       e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.

We also share aggregated anonymous information  about visitors to the Sites with Monster's clients, partners, other Site  visitors, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of  visitors to the Sites and how those visitors use the Sites in order to serve  advertisements to you on our Sites or other sites with which we have a business  relationship. We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job  qualifications, schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant  to the job search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such  aggregated data does not identify users individually, and may be made available  to employers or fellow job seekers or community members. We disclose  information to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our  behalf. Examples include hosting our web servers, data, providing marketing  assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  These companies and individuals will have access to your personal information  as may necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that  information with any other third party.<br>
  We supply technology, hosting, hiring  management and related services to other leading companies to power recruitment  areas on their Web sites (sometimes referred to as &quot;Hosted Career  Sites&quot;). Personal and/or demographic information supplied by you in Hosted  Career Sites becomes part of the Monster database, but it is not accessible by  anyone other than you, Monster, and the company concerned without your consent.  If you attempt to register with Monster after registering with a Hosted Career  Site, Monster will recognize your information and you will be able to use the  information you provided to the Hosted Career Site in your account  registration.<br>
  Information gathered on a page in a Hosted  Career Site area or on a co-branded page may be retained by both Monster and  the other company. In that instance, the use of such information by the other  company will be subject to the privacy policy of that company and Monster is  not responsible for that company's use of your personal or demographic  information.<br>
  If you apply for a position through a Hosted  Career Site or a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on  your age, gender or race where permitted by law. You should understand that, if  provided, this information should only be used by employers in accordance with  applicable law. However, Monster is not responsible for the actions of such  employers. All such information provided will be kept separate by Monster from  your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information  is strictly voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or  treatment from Monster if you choose not to provide this information.<br>
  If you apply for a position on Monster through  a Hosted Career Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender,  race, or other protected status, or for a government identity number where  permitted by applicable law. Some employers are required by law to gather this  information from job applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements.  You should understand that if provided, this information may only be used by  employers only in accordance with applicable law and they should not use it in  making any negative employment decisions. All information provided will be kept  separate from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing  this information is subject to local law.</li>
  <li>We disclose information if legally required to do so,       or at our discretion pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or       if we believe in good faith after considering your privacy interests and       other factors that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal       requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or       property or our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect       national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the       public. Because Monster.com (India) Private Limited is an Indian Company       and its Parent Company Monster Worldwide, Inc. is a US company, your       information may become subject to both Indian and U.S. law.</li>
  <li>We may disclose and transfer such information to a       third party who acquires any or all of Monster's business units, whether       such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or       a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event Monster       becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary or       involuntary, Monster or its liquidator, administrator, receiver or       administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such       information in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified       of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third       party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the Sites.</li>

        <p><strong>Policy For Private Resume Database Hosting</strong></p>
        <p>Monster provides a variety of services to its customers related  to hosting private databases, and the use of certain Monster applications in  connection with such databases. These Hosted Databases are hosted by Monster,  but Monster does not own the data in the Hosted Databases or submitted to our  applications. These Hosted Databases may contain personal information about  individuals, including candidates for employment and existing employees of our  customers. Such data may include contact details, work history, educational  history, work preferences, and other data, depending on the particular customer  and application at issue, and, in some instances, may include personally  identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;).</p>
        <p>Monster provides hosting space to the customers who own these  Databases and utilize our applications on such data, and Monster therefore  conduct its activities strictly in accordance with the customer instructions  and pursuant to Monster&rsquo;s contractual arrangements with them. Monster&rsquo;s  customers act as data controllers with respect to all such Hosted Databases.  The data in such databases, including any such data submitted to our  applications, is subject to the <strong>customer&rsquo;s  privacy policies</strong>. If you are a candidate for employment with one of our  customers, you should refer to the customer's Terms &amp; conditions / Privacy  page on their career site to understand the terms and privacy practices that  apply to your data. Moreover, if you would like to access and review your  Personal Information, you should contact our customer with any such requests.  We will cooperate as appropriate with requests from our customers to assist  with such responses.</p>
Monster is not responsible  for its customers' privacy policies or practices.<br>
<br>
<p><strong>An Important Note about Your Resume</strong><br><br>

  We give you the option of putting your resume in our database.<br><br>

  When you create or post a resume to the Sites, that resume is  stored in our searchable resume database in Singapore. You may control the  status of your resume by setting it to private or public.<br><br>

  You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it to  be searchable by potential employers or recruiters. Not allowing your resume to  be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but  employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume  database product.<br><br>

  If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by  potential employers or other with access to our resume database. You may still  use your resume to apply online to a job. If you do apply online to a job, your  resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of  your resume or distribute it to third parties. We cannot control their use or  retention of your resume information.<br><br>

  If you set your resume as public, but want your contact  information to be confidential, your resume will be searchable by potential  employers, but we will hide your contact information and current company. You  must also remove your contact information from your uploaded or copy and paste  text resume. You should be aware that if you have a rare skill or job title,  for example, it may still be possible for you to be identified even without  your contact details being included. If you are worried about being identified,  you should not include specific details by which you could be identified. If  you use a confidential resume to apply to a job online, the employer to whom  you send your resume will be able to view your contact information in order to  contact you about your application.<br><br>

  If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it  confidential, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database  (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties  with access to our searchable resume database may be located in countries whose  data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country.  For example, your resume may be viewed and accessed by employers outside the  European Economic Area who have access to our searchable database. By making  your resume searchable, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of data.<br><br>

  We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database to  legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers,  headhunters and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and  national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not  gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes by  third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable  database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time;  details of how to do this are given below. However, employers, recruiters and  others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have  otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume  in their own files or databases. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that  parties other than those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain  access to this database. However Monster is not responsible for the retention,  use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We cannot control the  retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by  third parties. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information,  personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in  your resume.<br><br>

  If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your  responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded  his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so.<br><br>

  If you use our facilities to build a resume or to post a resume  in our database, then you will be providing us with personal data we will use  in accordance with this Statement. Your resume must not contain sensitive data  relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii)  philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or  political party (v) physical or mental health or genetic makeup (vi)  addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or  proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) any Social Security  Number or national identification number, if you set your resume as private  unless you have previously sent to us your written consent that we may process  your sensitive personal data, if Monster determines this to be a requirement of  applicable law. If your resume does contain such data and you set your resume  as public, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in  accordance with this Statement. We cannot control third parties' access to such  information from our searchable database.<br><br>

 <strong>Posting Your Information to Public Areas of Monster</strong><br><br>

  Please remember that if you post any of your personal  information in public areas of Monster, such as in online forums, public  profiles, chat rooms, or in the searchable resume database, such information  may be collected and used by others over whom Monster has no control.

  <strong>Important Information</strong><br><br>

  <strong><em>Security</em></strong> <br>
  <br>
  You are responsible for ensuring that your log-in credentials  (your username and password) are kept confidential.<br>
  <br>
  Monster has implemented technical and organizational measures  designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from  unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Notwithstanding such  measures, the Internet is an open system and we cannot guarantee that  unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat those measures or use  your personal information for improper purposes. Moreover, one of our primary  purposes is to provide you with a platform to broadcast the information in your  resume and profile widely in order to maximize your career opportunities. Such  an environment does present a risk that unauthorized third parties will view  this data, so you should refer to our Security Center for additional  information on conducting a safe job search. Further, your resume should not  contain any sensitive data that you would not want made public. You should be  aware that resumes may be monitored by your current employer.<br>
  <br>
  We also use cookies, web beacons, and Java Script to administer  our site and deliver a personalized experience. For additional detailed  information on each of these, please see below.<br>
  <br>
  <strong><em>Children</em></strong> <br>
  <br>
  We do not specifically collect information about children. We  believe that children should get their parent's consent before giving out  personal information. If you are concerned about your child's use of Monster,  we encourage you to use Web filtering technology to supervise your child's  access to the Web Site. We also encourage you to participate in your child's  experience with Monster. With a little guidance, the Web Site can prove very useful  in finding a part time or summer job for your child, as well as providing them  with excellent career counselling information<br>

  Use of Cookies, Web Beacons, and Java Script</p>
<p><br>
  <strong><em>Cookies:</em></strong>&nbsp;Monster  uses &quot;cookies&quot; to help personalize and maximize your online  experience and time online, including for storing user preferences, improving  search results and ad selection, and tracking user trends.<br>
  <br>
  A cookie is a text file that is either stored in your computer's  memory temporarily (a &quot;session&quot; cookie) or placed on your hard drive (a  &quot;persistent&quot; cookie) by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to  run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned  to your computer and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued  the cookie to you.<br><br>

  When you return to the Monster site, cookies enable us to  retrieve the information you previously provided, so you can easily use the  features that you customized. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver  faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. For  example, if you personalize Monster pages, or register for services, a cookie  helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and  preferences).<br><br>

  We predominately use &quot;session&quot; cookies, which are not  permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours  of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out a job search  or apply online a large amount of data is processed by our system and  transferred through each page of the search or application process. This  information includes your job search criteria, data that identifies your  resume, covering letter, the job you are applying for, your right to work in  the relevant country and the results of any questionnaire you have completed as  part of the online application process as well as demographic information that  is not unique to you. &quot;Session&quot; cookies allow us to keep track of  this data until you have completed your search or application. We also use  cookies to identify users who have been banned from using our forums for  behavior that contradicts our terms of use and to track click streams, for load  balancing and to enable you to navigate through the site using redirection  pages.<br><br>

  We use &quot;persistent&quot; cookies primarily to ensure that  we do not show you pages that you have already seen and to personalize your  site experience and save you time. &quot;Persistent&quot; Cookies enable us to  recognize whether you have responded to any poll or seen an advertisement or  information notice placed on the site so that we do not show you the poll,  advertisement or notice again the next time you visit our site. If you are a  recruiter and have an alliance arrangement in place with Monster we also use  &quot;persistent&quot; cookies to recall your alliance status and display your  correct pricing information when you access our site. The  &quot;persistent&quot; cookies we use will remain on your computer after you  have left our site and will expire when you log out of the Site or 60 days  after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your last visit for  poll response and alliance cookies, or two years after your last visit for  advertisement and information notice cookies. We also allow persistent third  party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to determine and track  site traffic landing from Monster's advertising banners that have been placed  on the websites of third parties. The data collected via these cookies is  anonymous and the information is not linked to your personally identifiable  information without your permission. The &quot;persistent&quot; cookies placed  by our third party ad servers will remain on your computer after you have left  our site for up to 20 years unless you choose to delete them.<br><br>

  We use persistent cookies and related technologies (such as web  beacons described below) to determine and track direct and indirect candidate  application traffic in response to Job Postings either on Monster or on the  websites of third parties through Monster's Career-Ad-Network (described  below). We also use &quot;persistent&quot; cookies in connection with our  Career Ad Network (&quot;CAN&quot;). The CAN cookie is used to display relevant  job ads to you on Monster and when you visit other web sites. The information  collected by the CAN cookie is treated in accordance with the policies and  practices described in our Privacy Statement above. The &quot;persistent&quot;  cookie we use in CAN will remain on your computer after you have left our site  and will expire six months after it was set.<br><br>

  You have the ability to update or opt-out of the CAN cookie by  clicking on the following link:&nbsp;<a href="http://hiring.monster.com/recruitment/Job-Advertisement-Network.aspx?intcid=CTA_AP-CAN"   target="_blank">http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx</a>. Monster  enforces your opt-out of CAN by setting a &quot;blocking cookie&quot;. In order  for the blocking cookie to work on your computer, your browser must be set to  accept third party cookies. The blocking cookie for CAN will last for five  years; however, if you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie, as well  as any updates you may have made, will also be deleted. In addition, your  opt-out only applies in the browser you are using at the time you opt-out and  only on the computer you are using at such time. If you buy a new computer,  change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out  task again. Opting-out of the CAN cookie does not mean you will no longer  receive online advertising from CAN. It does mean that the ads delivered to you  by CAN will no longer be tailored to your Web browsing patterns. Once you  opt-out CAN no longer maintains a targeting cookie on your computer, so the ads  will be general in nature and could be repetitive.<br><br>

  We also allow other companies to display advertisements to you  while you are visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request these  advertisements from the other company servers, these companies can view, edit  or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their  site. Monster has no control over, and is not responsible for, the practices of  those third party advertisers. Monster encourages you to review the policies of  such advertisers. Third parties, such as Google, Double Click, Right media and  other advertiser platforms, may also use information that they gather from your  activity on our Web Site to select which Monster advertisement should be  displayed to you on web sites other than our Web Site.<br><br>

  You can opt-out of customized advertising by third parties by  setting your browser to decline third party cookies or some browsers allow you  to block cookies from a particular third party whose customized advertising you  do not wish to receive. You can also delete the advertiser's cookie each time  after it has been served. In addition, third party advertisers, including  advertising networks, may offer an opt-out of their customized advertising. If  you visit an advertiser's own web site, you will be able to see their policies.  If you wish, you may opt out of Google's use of customized advertising by  visiting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/"   target="_blank">Google  advertising opt-out</a>&nbsp;page, you can  opt out of DoubleClick's use of customized advertising by visiting the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/"   target="_blank">DoubleClick  opt-out page</a>, and you can opt out  of Right Media's use of customized advertising by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html"   target="_blank">Right Media opt out page</a>.<br><br>

  You will find additional information about the following third  party ad servers at www.doubleclick.com; www.atlassolutions.com/privacy;  and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy"   target="_blank">www.omniture.com/en/privacy</a>.  You may also&nbsp;<a href="http://inside.monster.com/ad-network/inside2.aspx"   target="_blank">click  here</a>&nbsp;to see a list of  many of the companies that Monster works with in connection with serving  personalized ads. Otherwise, if you do not wish to allow your session  visitation information on our Sites to be aggregated and analyzed by Omniture,  or used by Omniture to tailor dynamic content to your specific interests, you  may utilize the following opt out mechanism&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adobe.com/privacy.html#optout"   target="_blank">www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout</a>.<br><br>

  In addition, many of these third parties are members of the  Network Advertising Initiative, which requires its members to provide a  permanent opt-out from their customized ads. You can opt-out of customized  advertising by all NAI members by visiting the NAI site. However, since opting  out is enforced by serving a blocking cookie, if you later delete all cookies,  you will also delete your blocking cookie and will need to set it again. In  addition, advertiser opt-out cookies may expire after a set period of time and  will need to be re-set following their expiration.<br><br>

  If you opt-out of customized advertising by third parties, you  will still see ads on our Web Site and Monster ads elsewhere on web sites other  than our Web Site, however, such ads will be not be customized to your  interests and may be less relevant to you.<br><br>

  Please note that if you opt-out of cookies by changing your  browser settings, your opt-out will be saved but it may not be carried with you  if you choose to use another browser or log-in from another computer. You  should check your browser settings each time you open a new browser or log-in  from a different computer.<br><br>

  This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service  provided by Google, Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;). Google Analytics uses  &quot;cookies&quot;, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the  website analyze how users use the site. The information generated by the cookie  about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted  to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google will use this  information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling  reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services  relating to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this  information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such  third parties process the information on Google's behalf. Google will not  associate your IP address with any other data held by Google. You may refuse  the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser,  however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full  functionality of this website. By using this website, you consent to the  processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set  out above.<br><br>

  Additionally, Monster uses &quot;Flash cookies&quot;, also known  as &quot;Local Shared Objects&quot;, to preserve video player settings and for  user authentication purposes. You can adjust your settings for your Flash  cookies here.<br><br>

  <strong><em>Web Beacons:</em></strong>&nbsp;Monster Web pages and the Web pages of our partners also  utilize electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel  gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us to collect certain information  about user visits to these Web pages (including the number of users who have  visited those pages), measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements  and job postings, and deliver co-branded services. Web beacons are not used to  access your personally identifiable information; they are a technique used to  compile aggregated statistics about web site usage. Web beacons collect only a  limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page  view and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. This  information may be shared with third party processors for processing on behalf  of Monster, as well as with clients, partners, and other third parties so that  they can understand the kinds of visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors  use those Web Pages, and the effectiveness of their advertisements and job  postings. (You will find information about a current third-party processor used  by Monster at www.atlassolutions.com. We may use other third party processors  as well.)<br><br>

  Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request  included in the recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them. However, they  can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the  cookie setup in your browser.<br><br>

  <strong><em>JavaScript:</em></strong>&nbsp;Monster also uses JavaScript, for example, within certain  advertisements. JavaScript is a script language that enhances the functionality  of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We are not collecting any  personal data via JavaScript but use it to inform employers about how many  applicants have clicked on email addresses embedded in their job ads, for  example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser settings or activate it  the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be able to use some of the  functions of the website. Thank you for using Monster.<br><br>
