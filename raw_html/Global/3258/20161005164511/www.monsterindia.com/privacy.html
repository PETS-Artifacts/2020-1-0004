Some of our products and services, such as our searchable  resume database and networking, enable third parties to see your personal  information and to contact you. Profile information may be used for networking  with other community members or may be visible to employers who are using the  Monster Sites. In addition, portions of your searchable resume (but not your  contact information) may be made public in your networking profile. <br />
    <br />
    Information you post in public areas of the site or place in  the searchable resume database will be accessed, used, and stored by others  around the world, including those in countries that might not have legislation  that guarantees adequate protection of personal information as defined by your  country of residence. By providing your personal information for inclusion in  our database, you acknowledge that you consent to your information being used  as described here. While Monster takes measures to safeguard your information  from unauthorized access or inappropriate use by third parties, Monster does  not control these third parties and we are not responsible for their use of  information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of the Monster  Sites. Accordingly, you should ensure that you do not post sensitive  information, including personality profiles, to any Monster Site. <br />
    <br />
    We use data we have about you to determine whether you might be  interested in the opportunities, products or services of a particular third  party. We show you targeted ads on our sites or other sites with which we have  a business relationship. These ads are targeted based on information we collect  about you and information about you we acquire from third parties. &nbsp;<br />
    <br />
<strong>Information about all Monster Visitors</strong><br />
      We gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas  users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only  use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us  determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually  create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with  our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how  Monster visitors use our Web Site, and also create a better overall experience  for you. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Monster  to any outside parties, except when to the extent necessary or appropriate to  comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations or in legal proceedings when  such information is relevant. <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Information about you specifically</strong><br />
      Monster is a career site; we retain your personal information to assist in your  career performance or management including finding or retaining work; or to  facilitate other services to or by us. <br />
      <br />
      For example, when you sign up to use a service, enter into a  contest, or purchase a product, we collect more specific personal information  about you, such as your name, address, email address, telephone number,  qualifications or career history. <br />
      <br />
      If you choose to do so we may also retain sensitive  information about you such as information about your membership in a  professional or trade association or trade union. <br />
      <br />
      We may also ask you for other information, such as  information on your interests, your likes and dislikes regarding the Web Site,  the types of jobs you are interested in, etc., in an effort to deliver to you  the best possible Web Site experience. When you grant us your permission, we  will communicate with you regularly with tips, advice and survey information on  using the Monster Web Site to maximize your career development. Monster also  provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of these types of communications.  If you choose to receive these types of communications at the time of registration,  but later decide you no longer want to receive them, simply log in to your My  Monster account and edit your account profile. <br />
      <br />
      If you input your information on a co-branded registration  page, such as that of a Monster and partner company-sponsored contest, then  your information will be collected, used and becomes the property of both  Monster and the partner co-sponsoring the contest. In that instance, Monster is  not responsible for the information that the partner company receives or how it  is used. <br />
      <br />
      If you do not provide us with the information sought in the  required fields Monster may be limited in its ability to provide you with  services. <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Use and Disclosure of the Information we collect</strong><br />
      We use the information we gather on the Web Site, whether personal,  demographic, collective or technical, for the purposes of operating and  improving the Web Site, fostering a positive user experience, and delivering  the products and services that we offer. <br />
      <br />
      If you have provided consent for us to do so, we may also  use the information we gather to inform you of other products or services  available from us or our affiliated companies or to contact you about your  opinion of current products and services or potential new products and services  that may be offered. <br />
      <br />
      We may use your contact information in order to send you  e-mail or other communications regarding updates at the Web Site to contact you  about your opinion of current products and services or potential new products  and services that may be offered. We may also provide additional  communications, promotions and information on new Monster opportunities, and  additional job postings which may be of interest to you. The nature and  frequency of these messages will vary depending upon the information we have  about you. <br />
      <br />
      In addition, at the time of registration for an account, you  have the option to elect or not elect to receive additional communications,  information and promotions, including without limitation, free informational  newsletters from us relating to topics that may be of special interest to you,  such as career management advice. <br />
      <br />
      Monster cannot ensure that all of your private  communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways  not otherwise described in this Privacy Commitment. Therefore, although we are  committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not  expect, that your personal information or private communications will always  remain private. As a user of the Web Site, you understand and agree that you assume  all responsibility and risk for your use of the Web Site, the internet  generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off  the Web Site. <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Disclosure of Information to Others</strong><br />
      We disclose to third parties within your country and abroad  your personal information, combined personal, demographic, behavioral or  indirect information, as set forth below:
    <ol start="1" type="1">
      <li>We       disclose your resume to employers who have posted job opportunities that       may be of interest to you on the Web Site when you apply for those jobs.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="2" type="1">
      <li>We may       share your information with third parties who help us in the delivery of       our own products and services to you. We disclose information to companies       and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples       include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing       assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer       service. These companies and individuals may be located in a country,       whose data protection legislation is different from your country, and they       will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform       their functions, but they may not share that information with any other       third party or use that data for any other purpose. We will remain       responsible for any information shared in this way.    </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="3" type="1">
      <li>We may       disclose such information to third parties if you consent to such       disclosure. For example, if you make your resume searchable, then all       parties with access to our searchable resume database (or copies thereof)       will have access to your resume. If you indicate by configuring your       profile that you would like to receive information about the       opportunities, products or services of third parties, we supply your       contact information to select third parties such as employers, recruiters,       data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you       e-mail or otherwise communicating with you. We use data we have about you       (such as the interests and preferences you have expressed) to determine       whether you might be interested in the opportunities, products or services       of a particular third party. For example, if you indicate that you would       like to receive information about the opportunities, products or services       of third parties at the time you register for a Monster account, we supply       your contact information to third parties such as employers, recruiters,       data aggregators, marketers or others for the purpose of sending you       e-mail or otherwise communicating with you.</li>
  </ol>
    <p>We also share aggregated anonymous information about  visitors to the Sites with Monster&rsquo;s clients, partners, other Site visitors,  and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of visitors to  the Sites and how those visitors use the Sites in order to serve advertisements  to you on our Sites or other sites with which we have a business relationship.  We may also aggregate on an anonymous basis data regarding job qualifications,  schooling, age, experience level or other information relevant to the job  search or competition among job seekers for any such job. Such aggregated data  does not identify users individually, and may be made available to employers or  fellow job seekers or community members. We disclose information to companies  and individuals we employ to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include  hosting our web servers, data, providing marketing assistance, processing  credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies and  individuals will have access to your personal information as may necessary to  perform their functions, but they may not share that information with any other  third party.<br />
      <br />
      We supply technology, hosting, hiring management and related  services to other leading companies to power recruitment areas on their Web  sites (sometimes referred to as &ldquo;Hosted Career Sites&rdquo;). Personal and/or  demographic information supplied by you in Hosted Career Sites becomes part of  the Monster database, but it is not accessible by anyone other than you,  Monster, and the company concerned without your consent. If you attempt to  register with Monster after registering with a Hosted Career Site, Monster will  recognize your information and you will be able to use the information you  provided to the Hosted Career Site in your account registration.<br />
      <br />
      Information gathered on a page in a Hosted Career Site area  or on a co-branded page may be retained by both Monster and the other company.  In that instance, the use of such information by the other company will be  subject to the privacy policy of that company and Monster is not responsible  for that company's use of your personal or demographic information.<br />
      <br />
      If you apply for a position through a Hosted Career Site or  a co-branded site, you may be asked to provide information on your age, gender  or race where permitted by law. You should understand that, if provided, this  information should only be used by employers in accordance with applicable law.  However, Monster is not responsible for the actions of such employers. All such  information provided will be kept separate by Monster from your expression of  interest in any job opportunity. Providing this information is strictly  voluntary and you will not be subject to any adverse action or treatment from  Monster if you choose not to provide this information.<br />
      <br />
      If you apply for a position on Monster through a Hosted  Career Site, you may be asked to provide information on your gender, race, or  other protected status, or for a government identity number where permitted by  applicable law. Some employers are required by law to gather this information  from job applicants for reporting and record-keeping requirements. You should  understand that if provided, this information may only be used by employers  only in accordance with applicable law and they should not use it in making any  negative employment decisions. All information provided will be kept separate  from your expression of interest in any job opportunity. Providing this  information is subject to local law.</p>
    <ol start="4" type="1">
      <li>We       disclose information if legally required to do so, or at our discretion       pursuant to a request from a governmental entity or if we believe in good       faith after considering your privacy interests and other factors that such       action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with       legal process; (b) protect our rights or property or our affiliated companies;       (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the       personal safety of users or the public. Because Monster.com (India)       Private Limited is an Indian Company and its Parent Company Monster       Worldwide, Inc. is a US company, your information may become subject to       both Indian and U.S. law. 4. We may disclose and transfer such information       to a third party who acquires any or all of Monster's business units,       whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of       all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, in the event       Monster becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding, whether voluntary       or involuntary, Monster or its liquidator, administrator, receiver or       administrative receiver may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such       information in a transaction approved by the court. You will be notified       of the sale of all or a substantial portion of our business to a third       party by email or through a prominent notice posted on the Sites.</li>

<strong>An Important Note about Your Resume</strong><br />
      We give you the option of putting your resume in our database. <br />
      <br />
      When you create or post a resume to the Sites, that resume  is stored in our searchable resume database in India. You may control the  status of your resume by setting it to private or public. <br />
      <br />
      You can store your resume in our database, but not allow it  to be searchable by potential employers or recruiters. Not allowing your resume  to be searchable means that you can use it to apply for a job online, but  employers and recruiters will not have access to search it through our resume  database product. <br />
      <br />
      If you set your resume as private, it is not searchable by  potential employers or other with access to our resume database. You may still  use your resume to apply online to a job. If you do apply online to a job, your  resume will be transferred to the relevant employer, who may retain a copy of  your resume or distribute it to third parties. We cannot control their use or  retention of your resume information.<br />
      <br />
      If you set your resume as public, but want your contact  information to be confidential, your resume will be searchable by potential  employers, but we will hide your contact information and current company. You  must also remove your contact information from your uploaded or copy and paste  text resume. You should be aware that if you have a rare skill or job title,  for example, it may still be possible for you to be identified even without  your contact details being included. If you are worried about being identified,  you should not include specific details by which you could be identified. If  you use a confidential resume to apply to a job online, the employer to whom  you send your resume will be able to view your contact information in order to  contact you about your application.<br />
      <br />
      If you allow your resume to be searchable without making it  confidential, then all parties with access to our searchable resume database  (or copies thereof) will have access to your resume. Employers or other parties  with access to our searchable resume database may be located in countries whose  data protection legislation may not be equivalent to the laws in your country.  For example, your resume may be viewed and accessed by employers outside the  European Economic Area who have access to our searchable database. By making your  resume searchable, you are expressly consenting to such transfers of data. <br />
      <br />
      We attempt to limit access to our searchable resume database  to legitimate users such as paying employers, recruiters, hiring managers,  headhunters and human resource professionals, as well as law enforcement and  national security agencies, but cannot guarantee that other parties will not  gain access to this database. We cannot control the use made of resumes by  third parties who access such resumes while they are in our searchable  database. You may remove your resume from our searchable database at any time;  details of how to do this are given below. However, employers, recruiters and  others who have paid for access to that database, as well as parties who have  otherwise gained access to the database may have retained a copy of your resume  in their own files or databases. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that  parties other than those mentioned above will not, without our consent, gain  access to this database. However Monster is not responsible for the retention,  use, or privacy of resumes by any third parties. We cannot control the  retention, use or privacy of resumes or profiles that have been downloaded by  third parties. Accordingly, you should not put sensitive information,  personality profiles, or other information you would not want made public, in  your resume. <br />
      <br />
      If you provide us with details of a reference, it is your  responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded  his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so. <br />
      <br />
      If you use our facilities to build a resume or to post a  resume in our database, then you will be providing us with personal data we  will use in accordance with this Statement. Your resume must not contain  sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political  beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade  union or political party (v) physical or mental health or genetic makeup (vi)  addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or  proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) any Social Security  Number or national identification number, if you set your resume as private  unless you have previously sent to us your written consent that we may process  your sensitive personal data, if Monster determines this to be a requirement of  applicable law. If your resume does contain such data and you set your resume  as public, then you agree that we may retain this information and use it in  accordance with this Statement. We cannot control third parties&rsquo; access to such  information from our searchable database. <br />
      <br />
  <strong>Posting Your Information to Public Areas of Monster</strong><br />
      Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in public  areas of Monster, such as in online forums, public profiles, chat rooms, or in  the searchable resume database, such information may be collected and used by  others over whom Monster has no control. We cannot control the use made by  third parties of information you post or otherwise make available in public  areas of Monster.<br />

      <br />
      Monster has implemented technical and organizational measures  designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from  unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure.

For  example, if you personalize Monster pages, or register for services, a cookie  helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and  preferences).<br />
      <br />
      We predominately use &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookies, which are not  permanently stored on your hard drive. Session cookies expire after two hours  of inactivity or when you close your browser. When you carry out a job search  or apply online a large amount of data is processed by our system and  transferred through each page of the search or application process. This  information includes your job search criteria, data that identifies your  resume, covering letter, the job you are applying for, your right to work in  the relevant country and the results of any questionnaire you have completed as  part of the online application process as well as demographic information that  is not unique to you. &ldquo;Session&rdquo; cookies allow us to keep track of this data until  you have completed your search or application. We also use cookies to identify  users who have been banned from using our forums for behavior that contradicts  our terms of use and to track click streams, for load balancing and to enable  you to navigate through the site using redirection pages. <br />
      <br />
      We use &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies primarily to ensure that we do  not show you pages that you have already seen and to personalize your site  experience and save you time. &ldquo;Persistent&rdquo; Cookies enable us to recognize  whether you have responded to any poll or seen an advertisement or information  notice placed on the site so that we do not show you the poll, advertisement or  notice again the next time you visit our site. If you are a recruiter and have  an alliance arrangement in place with Monster we also use &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies  to recall your alliance status and display your correct pricing information  when you access our site. The &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies we use will remain on your  computer after you have left our site and will expire when you log out of the  Site or 60 days after your last visit for security cookies, 90 days after your  last visit for poll response and alliance cookies, or two years after your last  visit for advertisement and information notice cookies. We also allow  persistent third party cookies as part of online advertising campaigns to  determine and track site traffic landing from Monster&rsquo;s advertising banners  that have been placed on the websites of third parties. The data collected via  these cookies is anonymous and the information is not linked to your personally  identifiable information without your permission. The &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies  placed by our third party ad servers will remain on your computer after you  have left our site for up to 20 years unless you choose to delete them. <br />
      <br />
      We use persistent cookies and related technologies (such as  web beacons described below) to determine and track direct and indirect  candidate application traffic in response to Job Postings either on Monster or  on the websites of third parties through Monster&rsquo;s Career-Ad-Network (described  below). We also use &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookies in connection with our Career Ad  Network (&ldquo;CAN&rdquo;). The CAN cookie is used to display relevant job ads to you on  Monster and when you visit other web sites. The information collected by the  CAN cookie is treated in accordance with the policies and practices described  in our Privacy Statement above. The &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookie we use in CAN will  remain on your computer after you have left our site and will expire six months  after it was set. <br />
      <br />
      You have the ability to update or opt-out of the CAN cookie  by clicking on the following link: <a href="http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx"   target="_blank">http://can.monster.com/cookie-technology.aspx.</a> Monster enforces your opt-out of CAN by setting a &ldquo;blocking cookie&rdquo;. In order  for the blocking cookie to work on your computer, your browser must be set to  accept third party cookies. The blocking cookie for CAN will last for five  years; however, if you delete your browser cookies, your opt-out cookie, as  well as any updates you may have made, will also be deleted. In addition, your  opt-out only applies in the browser you are using at the time you opt-out and  only on the computer you are using at such time. If you buy a new computer,  change web browsers or delete this cookie, you will need to perform the opt-out  task again. Opting-out of the CAN cookie does not mean you will no longer  receive online advertising from CAN. It does mean that the ads delivered to you  by CAN will no longer be tailored to your Web browsing patterns. Once you  opt-out CAN no longer maintains a targeting cookie on your computer, so the ads  will be general in nature and could be repetitive. <br />
      <br />
      We also allow other companies to display advertisements to  you while you are visiting our Sites. Because your web browser must request  these advertisements from the other company servers, these companies can view,  edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from  their site. Monster has no control over, and is not responsible for, the  practices of those third party advertisers. Monster encourages you to review  the policies of such advertisers. Third parties, such as Google, Double Click,  Right media and other advertiser platforms, may also use information that they  gather from your activity on our Web Site to select which Monster advertisement  should be displayed to you on web sites other than our Web Site. <br />
      <br />
      You can opt-out of customized advertising by third parties  by setting your browser to decline third party cookies or some browsers allow  you to block cookies from a particular third party whose customized advertising  you do not wish to receive. You can also delete the advertiser&rsquo;s cookie each  time after it has been served. In addition, third party advertisers, including  advertising networks, may offer an opt-out of their customized advertising. If  you visit an advertiser&rsquo;s own web site, you will be able to see their policies.  If you wish, you may opt out of Google's use of customized advertising by  visiting the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/"   target="_blank">Google advertising opt-out page</a>, you can opt out of  DoubleClick&rsquo;s use of customized advertising by visiting the<a href="http://www.google.com/doubleclick/"   target="_blank"> DoubleClick opt-out  page</a>, and you can opt out of Right Media&rsquo;s use of customized advertising by  visiting <a href="https://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html"   target="_blank">Right Media opt out page</a>. <br />
      <br />
      You will find additional information about the following  third party ad servers at www.doubleclick.com; www.atlassolutions.com/privacy;  and <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy"   target="_blank">www.omniture.com/en/privacy</a>.  You may also <a href="http://inside.monster.com/ad-network/inside2.aspx"   target="_blank">click her</a>e to see a list of many of the companies that  Monster works with in connection with serving personalized ads. Otherwise, if  you do not wish to allow your session visitation information on our Sites to be  aggregated and analyzed by Omniture, or used by Omniture to tailor dynamic  content to your specific interests, you may utilize the following opt out  mechanism <a href="http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout"   target="_blank">www.omniture.com/en/privacy/policy#optout</a>. <br />
      <br />
      In addition, many of these third parties are members of the  Network Advertising Initiative, which requires its members to provide a  permanent opt-out from their customized ads. You can opt-out of customized  advertising by all NAI members by visiting the NAI site. However, since opting  out is enforced by serving a blocking cookie, if you later delete all cookies,  you will also delete your blocking cookie and will need to set it again. In addition,  advertiser opt-out cookies may expire after a set period of time and will need  to be re-set following their expiration. <br />
      <br />
      If you opt-out of customized advertising by third parties,  you will still see ads on our Web Site and Monster ads elsewhere on web sites  other than our Web Site, however, such ads will be not be customized to your  interests and may be less relevant to you. <br />
      <br />
      Please note that if you opt-out of cookies by changing your  browser settings, your opt-out will be saved but it may not be carried with you  if you choose to use another browser or log-in from another computer. You  should check your browser settings each time you open a new browser or log-in  from a different computer. <br />
      <br />
      This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service  provided by Google, Inc. (&ldquo;Google&rdquo;). Google Analytics uses &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, which are  text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use  the site. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website  (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on  servers in the United States. Google will use this information for the purpose  of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity  for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity  and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties  where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the  information on Google's behalf. Google will not associate your IP address with  any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting  the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do  this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. By  using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google  in the manner and for the purposes set out above. <br />
      <br />
      Additionally, Monster uses &ldquo;Flash cookies&rdquo;, also known as  &ldquo;Local Shared Objects&rdquo;, to preserve video player settings and for user  authentication purposes. You can adjust your settings for your Flash cookies  here. <br />
      <br />
      <strong><em>Web Beacons</em>:</strong> Monster Web pages and the Web  pages of our partners also utilize electronic images known as Web beacons  (sometimes called single-pixel gifs, clear gifs or action tags) that allow us  to collect certain information about user visits to these Web pages (including  the number of users who have visited those pages), measure and improve the  effectiveness of advertisements and job postings, and deliver co-branded  services. Web beacons are not used to access your personally identifiable  information; they are a technique used to compile aggregated statistics about  web site usage. Web beacons collect only a limited set of information including  a cookie number, time and date of page view and a description of the page on  which the Web beacon resides. This information may be shared with third party  processors for processing on behalf of Monster, as well as with clients,  partners, and other third parties so that they can understand the kinds of  visitors to the Web pages, how those visitors use those Web Pages, and the  effectiveness of their advertisements and job postings. (You will find  information about a current third-party processor used by Monster at <a href="http://www.atlassolutions.com">www.atlassolutions.com</a>. We may use  other third party processors as well.) <br />
      <br />
      Because Web beacons are the same as any other content  request included in the recipe page, you cannot opt out or refuse them.  However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or  changing the cookie setup in your browser. <br />
      <br />
      <strong><em>JavaScript:</em></strong> Monster also uses JavaScript, for  example, within certain advertisements. JavaScript is a script language that  enhances the functionality of websites, particularly in respect to pictures. We  are not collecting any personal data via JavaScript but use it to inform  employers about how many applicants have clicked on email addresses embedded in  their job ads, for example. You may deactivate JavaScript via your browser  settings or activate it the same way. If you disable JavaScript you will not be  able to use some of the functions of the website. <br />
      Thank you for using Monster. <br />
