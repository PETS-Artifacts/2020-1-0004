	Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of <b>Personal Information*</b>. The following outlines our privacy policy.
</p>
<p>
We made some important changes in what data we collect and made our privacy policy easier to read, to comply with the new European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) fully implemented from 25 May 2018.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Before or at the time of collecting <b>Personal Information*</b>, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
	</li>
	<li>
		We will collect and use of <b>Personal Information*</b> solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.		
	</li>
	<li>
		We will only retain <b>Personal Information*</b> as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes. 
	</li>
	<li>
		We will collect <b>Personal Information*</b> by lawful and fair means and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the individual concerned.

	We are committed to conducting our business in accordance with these principles in order to ensure that the confidentiality of <b>Personal Information*</b> is protected and maintained. 
</p>
