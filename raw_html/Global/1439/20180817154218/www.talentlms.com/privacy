						our customers (“Customers”) can train their personnel or any other group of people they wish or provide distance eLearning services.
						Customers access the TalentLMS service by means of a unique combination of a user identifier and secure password.
						By gaining access to the service through this combination, the Customers are allocated a specific domain that is owned and managed exclusively
						by them. The Customer specifies, customizes and provides access to the service to the authorized users (“Users”) of his domain, consisting of
						course Instructors and Learners. Additionally, the Customer may specify custom User roles for his domain. The course Instructors specify
						and manage the content of the courses, which may include text documents, video and audio files, images, presentations. Learners attend
						the courses and are subject to tests, for which they are graded; Learners have access to their own grades through the service.
						Each Learner can view his grades and extract reports, by means of supplying the reporting criteria through the respective service interface,
						regarding his own performance and his overall use of the service. Each Instructor can extract reports for the activity of his courses.
						The Customer owns his domain data and can extract reports for the total activity of his domain, including all its Users.
