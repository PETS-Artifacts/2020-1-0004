In addition, if you submit a photograph in connection with your posting, you represent that you have the right to submit the photograph to us and that we can use the photograph in connection with your submission.<br />&nbsp;<br />We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, click stream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.<br />&nbsp;<br />We use cookies and log file information to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns, to monitor aggregate metrics, such as total number of visitors, and pages viewed, and to track your entries and submissions.</p>

<p><br /><strong>15. Our Commitment To Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, National Partnership does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information or non-personally-identifiable information on the Website from persons under 13 years of age, and no part of our Website is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access the Website at any time or in any manner.

<p><br /><strong>16. In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />These Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by National Partnership without restriction. In addition, in the event that National Partnership is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.</p>
<p><br /><strong>17. General</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />These Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the District of Columbia, without respect to its conflict of laws rules.

These Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by National Partnership on the Website shall constitute the entire agreement between you and National Partnership concerning the Website. If any provision of these Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions set forth herein, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and National Partnership&rsquo;s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
<p><br /><strong>18. Changes and Updates to these Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />This Terms and Conditions of Use and Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the date below.
