From time to time we may use other advertising networks or service providers to show you our ads on other websites.  Many advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt-out of ad targeting from member companies, which you can access and review your options for opting out at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">http://www.networkadvertising.org/</a>. However, even if you opt out of receiving tailored ads, you will continue to see ads but those ads may be less relevant to your interests.</p>

<p><b>ANALYTICS</b></p>

<p>In order to better understand and optimize our Website and your use of it, for business and market research purposes, for measuring conversion tracking, and measuring the effectiveness of our content and online advertising campaigns, we work with service providers to provide analytics data via cookies alone or in conjunction with unique identifiers, pixels, beacons and other tracking technologies which collect information about you when you use the Website.<br><br>

For example, through our provider, Google Analytics, data is collect about use of the Website.
