	<div class="header">Privacy Statement for LFP Internet Group, LLC</div>
	
	<p><b>LFP Internet Group, LLC. ("LFP")</b> has
	created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to
	privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination
	practices for the websites operated by us.</p>
	
	<p><b>IP Addresses:</b>  when visitors access our websites, we
	automatically capture the IP address of the source computer, the referring site
	and the destination site.  We use this
	information to control access to our websites, and to optimize the presentation
	of our websites. IP addresses may also
	be used to help identify users and to gather broad demographic information. We also capture data on which pages have been accessed
	by visitors, and the frequency with which they are accessed.This information is used to understand our visitors�
	preferences and to balance the load on our servers.</p>
	
	<p><b>Cookies:</b>  &quot;Cookies&quot; are small files of data
	that reside on visitors� computers.  Cookies allow us to recognize visitors, customize their experience, and
	offer efficiencies related to login and access.  We set a &quot;Session Cookie&quot; upon visitor login to enable them to
	access multiple domains without having to re-enter login information.  Once a user closes their browser, Session
	Cookies become inactive. We may also set longer-lasting cookies to make login
	procedures more efficient for returning members.  These may contain email addresses or
	usernames which are encrypted so they can be interpreted only by LFP.  From time to time we may share cookie
	information with third-party partners with whom we have an official
	relationship.  This is done to make the
	establishment of new accounts more efficient, and to facilitate special
	offers.  Most browsers have settings that
	enable users to disable cookies on their machines.  If cookies are disabled, certain website
	services or functionality may not function properly.</p>
	
	<p><b>Third-Party Websites:</b>  LFP websites often contain links to websites operated by other companies
	that are not controlled by LFP. LFP
	therefore has no responsibility or liability for the policies, activities or
	content of these sites. Nonetheless, we seek to provide our visitors with a
	positive experience, so we welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>
	
	<p><b>Public Forums:</b>  websites operated by LFP may contain chat rooms, forums, message boards,
	and/or news groups.  LFP prohibits the posting of illegal or defamatory content in its chat rooms, forums, message
	boards, and/or news groups, and reserves the right to remove any user-posted
	content at LFP�s sole discretion.  Please remember that any information that is disclosed in
	these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when
	disclosing personal information.</p>
	
	<p><b>Financial Information:</b>  financial information, such as a credit card number or bank account
	number, is captured when users place an order or make a purchase.  Financial information is used to check the purchaser�s
	qualifications and to process payment(s) for products and services ordered.  Financial data is only captured on web pages
	that reside on secure servers. Transmission of financial data over the Internet
	is always fully encrypted. Storage of financial information is only handled by third-party PCI-compliant payment
	processors.  After a transaction, no financial data resides on LFP servers.&nbsp; Financial information is never shared with any
	parties other than the financial institutions directly involved in processing
	the transaction.</p>
	
	<p><b>Personal Information:</b>  personal information such as a person�s first name, last name or billing
	address, is captured when a user places an order or makes a purchase. This information is used to check the purchaser�s
	qualifications and to process payment(s) for products and services ordered. This information is also used for customer
	support purposes.  We may disclose personal information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment,
	order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process.  We may also disclose personal information in
	the course of investigating suspected fraud or other illegal activity.  Outside of the aforementioned legal
	processes, personal information is never shared with any parties other than the
	financial institutions directly involved in processing the transaction.</p>
	
	<p><b>Customer Information:</b>  customer information such as a username, password or email address can
	be captured when a customer registers on a website, places an order, subscribes
	to a newsletter, responds to a survey, or otherwise enters information into a
	form on one of our websites. Customer information is primarily used to manage access to our websites and to communicate
	with customers when necessary about membership, product, billing or other
	support-related concerns. We may retain correspondence
	such as e-mails or faxes for the purpose of customer support reference and
	improvement.  Customer information may also
	be used to convey company news, administer a contest, conduct a survey,
	communicate a special offer from a preferred partner, or promote internal programs.  All promotional emails contain an easy and
	automated way to unsubscribe from receiving future emails.  Alternatively, recipients can also unsubscribe
	from receiving future emails by sending a request to <a href="mailto:unsubscribe@hustleremail.com">unsubscribe@hustleremail.com</a>.</p>

	visitors expressly consent to the use and disclosure of personal information in
	the manner described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
