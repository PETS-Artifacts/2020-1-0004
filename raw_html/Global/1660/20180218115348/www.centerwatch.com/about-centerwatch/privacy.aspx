        <p>The types of Personal Information we may collect (directly from you or from Third Party-sources) and our privacy 
        practices depend on the nature of the relationship you have with WCG and the requirements of applicable law.  We 
        endeavor to collect information only relevant for the purposes of Processing.  Below are the legal bases and some 
        of the ways we collect information and how we use it.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Individuals</h3>

        <p>WCG collects Personal Information regarding its current, prospective and former clients, customers, visitors 
        and guests (collectively &#8220;Individuals&#8221;). The data we collect from Individuals includes information 
        such as title, name, address, phone number, email address, user name, answer to a security question and password, 
        government identification (driver&#8217;s license, passport), and credit card and other financial information related 
        to payments for services or goods. We may also collect demographic information you choose to provide, such as 
        your business or company information, professional experiences, educational background, nationality, ethnic origin, 
        age, gender, interests, preferences and favorites.</p>

        <p>We acquire, hold, use and Process Personal Information about Individuals for a variety of business purposes including to:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>generally manage Individual information and accounts;</li>

            <li>measure interest in and improve WCG websites and systems;</li>
            <li>develop new products, processes and services;</li>
            <li>notify you about offers, products and services that may be of interest to you;</li>
            <li>process applications and transactions;</li>
            <li>prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities;</li>
            <li>enforce our Terms of Use; and</li>
            <li>for purposes disclosed at the time that Individuals provide Personal Information or otherwise with consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2	General Information Collected &amp; Used by WCG Companies</h3>

        <p>Depending on how you interact with WCG, we and our Third Party-service providers may also 
        collect and use information in a variety of ways, including:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>IRBs&#8211;Institutional Review Board Members</strong>. Our IRBs are dedicated to conducting a thorough review process, 
                utilizing expert board members who undergo rigorous regulatory training. From these board members, 
                we may collect contact and biographical information, including name, address, email address, telephone 
                number, date of birth, driver&#8217;s license and Social Security number; financial and other 
                employment-related information, including financial data related to credit checks, bank details 
                for payroll, contact information of third parties in case of an emergency, and beneficiaries under 
                any insurance policy; and professional and educational background and experience, such as information that may 
                be recorded on a CV or application form and language abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>IRBs&#8211;Research Subject Information</strong>. When research subjects communicate with our IRBs, we obtain whatever information the research subject chooses to provide (including, e.g., name and email address), and use that information to respond to the subject&#8217;s request. Additionally, our IRBs receive information from investigators regarding adverse events. We endeavor to instruct investigators to provide such records in de-identified form.</li>
            <li><strong>Clintrax (and Others)&#8211;Investigator Information</strong>. In order to provide our services, some of our companies (e.g., Clintrax, IRBs) may collect and store investigator, sponsor, clinical research organization (&#8220;CRO&#8221;), and institutional employee contact information, including names, addresses, phone and fax numbers and email addresses.</li>
            <li><strong>Clintrax&#8211;Contract and Banking Details</strong>. To facilitate its contract negotiation and site payment service offerings, Clintrax may handle contracts containing Personal Information (such as Social Security numbers) and collect payee bank account details and contact information through such contracts or separate banking documentation forms.</li>
            <li><strong>CenterWatch Patient Notification Service</strong>. Registration for CenterWatch&#8217;s Patient Notification Service, which automatically emails you as soon as a clinical trial is posted that matches criteria you specify, only requires that one provide an email address and select a therapeutic area of interest; registrants may also choose to provide their location. CenterWatch utilizes subscriber email addresses strictly for troubleshooting and web-maintenance efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>CenterWatch Clinical Trial Listings and Profile Pages</strong>. At the bottom of most <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/">trial listings</a>, <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/professional-resources/research-centers/">Research Center Profiles</a>, and <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/professional-resources/industry-providers/">Industry Provider Profiles</a> on CenterWatch&#8217;s website, you will find a submit template/form to submit a confidential posting to the company or individual you are contacting. The message will never go to any CenterWatch staff member. Furthermore, CenterWatch cannot access or retrieve any message that you submit using these forms; nor are we responsible for any of these messages. However, all messages will indicate to the receiver that the transmission originated at <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/">www.CenterWatch.com</a>. The company or individual you contact will only receive the information that you provide in the form, including, e.g., name, address, phone number, fax, email address, company (Profile Page forms only), and confidential message. To withhold information, simply leave the field blank.</li>
            <li><strong>CenterWatch&#8211;JobWatch User Information</strong>. Registrants for JobWatch, a source for clinical research jobs and career resources offered by CenterWatch, must provide only their email address, which may be used by member companies to find qualified job applicants. CenterWatch has access to subscriber email addresses and utilizes them for trouble-shooting and web-maintenance efforts. At times, CenterWatch may use this list to inform subscribers of a new service JobWatch is offering or a new product CenterWatch is introducing that may assist them in their career search. If you receive updates that you do not wish to receive, please contact us at <a href="mailto:jobwatch@centerwatch.com">jobwatch@centerwatch.com</a>.</li>

            <li><strong>ePS Products and Services&#8211;Patient, Provider, Trial Manager and Client Data Collected</strong>. As a leading provider of e-clinical solutions, ePS offers a variety of products and services to enhance clinical trial operations, many of which may involve the collection and use of Personal Information from patients, health care providers (&#8220;providers&#8221;), clinical trial managers and clients. Examples include:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>ePS&#8217; Rater Services</strong>, which include Rater Certification (through which ePS offers documented participation in training programs, scale-specific scoring proficiency, and applied skills training) and Rater Video Monitoring Services (through which ePS clinicians provide raters with feedback on their ongoing performance) can involve sensitive discussions between providers and patients. Importantly, ePS seeks to anonymize the videos by removing facial features;</li>
                <li><strong>Wellness Programs</strong>. In order to assist participants enrolled in clinical trials that have a lifestyle (weight watching) component, ePS provides access to a dietician and, as part of that process, collects profile information from program participants that includes weight and behavior information; and</li>
                <li><strong>Clinical Trial Portal</strong>. Personal Information from patients, providers, clinical trial managers and clients may also be stored in our ePS Clinical Trial Portal &#8211; a tool used to manage and track study-related content, tasks, activities, completion and communications between sponsors, site personnel and vendors involved in a study.</li>
            </ul>
            To the extent Third Parties collect Personal Information of patients, ePS seeks to ensure that such Third Parties provide adequate privacy notices to the Data Subjects.</li>
            <li><strong>WCG&#8211;Pseudonymous Data</strong>. Including as discussed <em>infra</em> at &#167;2.8.3, WCG may use and share your anonymized or aggregated information within the WCG family of companies or with Third Parties for public health, research, analytics and any other legally permissible purposes.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>2.4	Social Media and Interest-Based Advertising</h3>

        <p>Generally, online social media resources are interactive tools that enable Data Subjects to collaborate and 
        share information with others. Social media resources include, but are not limited to, social networks, 
        discussion boards, bulletin boards, blogs, wikis, and referral functions to share web site content and 
        tools with a friend or colleague. WCG may collect Personal Information to enable Data Subjects to 
        use online social media resources. We may also enable you to use these social media resources to 
        post or share Personal Information with others. When using social media resources, you should take 
        into careful consideration what Personal Information they share with others. WCG will comply with 
        the terms of this Privacy Policy and the privacy policies applicable to the social media resources it uses.</p>

        <p>Through our Sites, WCG may in the future allow Third-Party advertising partners to set tracking tools 
        (e.g., cookies) to collect anonymous, non-Personal Information regarding your activities (e.g., your IP 
        address, page(s) visited, time of day). We may also share such information we have collected with 
        Third-Party advertising partners. These advertising partners may use this information (and similar 
        information collected from other websites) for purposes of delivering future targeted advertisements to 
        you when you visit non-WCG related websites within their networks. This practice is commonly referred to as 
        &quot;interest-based advertising&quot; or &quot;online behavioral advertising.&quot;</p>

        <h3>2.5	Information from Third-Party Sources</h3>

        <p>WCG may collect information about you from Third-Party sources to supplement information provided by you. This supplemental information allows us to verify information that you have provided to WCG and to enhance our ability to provide you with information about our business, products and services. WCG&#8217;s agreements with these Third Party-sources typically limit how the Company may use this supplemental information.</p>

        <h3>2.6	Direct Mail, Email and Outbound Telemarketing</h3>

        <p>Individuals who provide us with Personal Information, or whose Personal Information we obtain from Third Parties, may receive periodic emails, newsletters, mailings or phone calls from us with information on WCG or our business partners&#8217; products and services or upcoming special offers/events we believe may be of interest. We offer our Individuals the option to decline these communications at no cost to the individual.</p>

        <h3>2.7	Research/Survey Solicitations</h3>

        <p>From time to time, WCG may perform research (online and offline) via surveys. We may engage Third Party-service providers to conduct such surveys on our behalf. All survey responses are voluntary, and the information collected will be used for research and reporting purposes to help us to better serve Individuals by learning more about their needs and the quality of the products and services we provide. The survey responses may be utilized to determine the effectiveness of our Sites, various types of communications, advertising campaigns and/or promotional activities. If an Individual participates in a survey, the information given will be used along with that of other study participants. We may share anonymous individual and aggregate data for research and analysis purposes.</p>

        <h3>2.8	All Internet Users – Cookies, Pixel Tags, Web Beacons and Aggregate Information</h3>

        <h4>2.8.1 Cookies</h4>

        <p>Like many other websites, WCG or its business partners may employ a cookie, or small piece of computer code that enables Web servers to &#8220;identify&#8221; visitors, each time an Individual initiates a session on the Company&#8217;s Sites. A cookie is set in order to identify Data Subjects; tailor our Sites to you; measure and research the effectiveness of our Sites&#8217; features, offerings and advertisements; and authenticate users for registered services. Cookies can only access Personal Information that you have provided on our Sites and cannot be accessed by other sites. We may also use Google Analytics and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to collect information regarding visitor behavior and visitor demographics on some our Sites, and to develop website content. This analytics data is not tied to any Personal Information. At any time, visitors may choose to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.</p>
        
        <p>Data Subjects also have the ability to delete cookie files from their own hard drive at any time. However, please also be advised that cookies may be necessary to provide access to much of the content and many of the features of WCG&#8217;s Sites.</p>

        <h4>2.8.2 Pixel Tags/Web Beacons</h4>

        <p>WCG may use &#8220;pixel tags,&#8221; also known as &#8220;web beacons,&#8221; which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our Sites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the Internet Protocol (&#8220;IP&#8221;) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the browser type and language; the device type; geographic location; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we or our Third Party-service providers may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email.</p>

        <h4>2.8.3 Anonymous and Aggregated Information</h4>

        <p>Anonymized and aggregated information is used for a variety of functions, including the measurement of visitors&#8217; interest in and use of various portions or features of the Sites. Anonymized or aggregated information is not Personal Information, and WCG may use such information in a number of ways, including research, internal analysis, analytics and any other legally permissible purposes. We may share this information within WCG and with Third Parties for our or their purposes in an anonymized or aggregated form that is designed to prevent anyone from identifying you.</p>

        <h3>2.9	Mobile Computing</h3>

        <p>WCG may provide websites and online resources that are specifically designed to be compatible and used on mobile computing devices. Mobile versions of WCG&#8217;s Sites may require that users log in with an account. In such cases, information about use of each mobile version of the website may be associated with user accounts. In addition, WCG may enable Individuals to download an application, widget or other tool that can be used on mobile or other computing devices. Some of these tools may store information on mobile or other devices. These tools may transmit Personal Information to WCG to enable Data Subjects to access user accounts and to enable WCG to track use of these tools. Some of these tools may enable users to email reports and other information from the tool. WCG may use personal or non-identifiable information transmitted to the Company to enhance these tools, to develop new tools, for quality improvement and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or in other notices WCG provides</p>

        <h2>3.0	CHOICE/MODALITIES TO OPT OUT</h2>

        <p>You have the right to opt out of certain uses and disclosures of your Personal Information, as set out in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>3.1	General</h3>

        <p>Where you have consented to WCG&#8217;s Processing of your Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Information, you may withdraw that consent at any time and opt out. Additionally, before we use Personal Information for any new purpose not originally authorized by you, we will provide information regarding the new purpose and give you the opportunity to opt out.</p>

        <p>Prior to disclosing Sensitive Data to a Third Party or Processing Sensitive Data for a purpose other than its original purpose or the purpose authorized subsequently by the Data Subject, WCG will endeavor to obtain each Data Subject&#8217;s explicit consent (opt-in). Where consent of the Data Subject for the Processing of Personal Information is otherwise required by law or contract, WCG will comply with the law or contract.</p>

        <h3>3.2	Email and Telephone Communications</h3>

        <p>An &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; button will be provided at the top or bottom of each email communications sent by WCG so that you can opt-out. However, we will continue to send transaction-related emails regarding products or services you have requested.</p>

        <p>Additionally, those registered for CenterWatch&#8217;s Patient Notification Service who no longer wish to receive updates may contact <a href="mailto:customerservice@centerwatch.com">customerservice@centerwatch.com</a> or follow the unsubscribe instructions at <a href="http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/pns/">http://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/pns/</a>.</p>

        <p>We maintain telephone &#8220;do not call&#8221; lists and &#8220;do not mail&#8221; lists as mandated by law. We process requests to be placed on do not mail, do not phone and do not contact lists within 60 days after receipt, or such shorter time as may be required by law.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Human Resources Data</h3>

        <p>With regard to Personal Information that WCG receives in connection with the employment relationship, WCG will use such Personal Information only for employment-related purposes as more fully described in section 2.3 above.  If WCG intends to use this Personal Information for any other purpose, the Company will provide the Data Subject with an opportunity to opt-out of such uses.</p>

        <h3>3.4 &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221;</h3>

        <p>Do Not Track (&#8220;DNT&#8221;) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. WCG does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals.</p>

        <h3>3.5 Advertising Choices</h3>

        <p>While WCG does not currently participate in interest-based advertising, it may in the future use your browsing for interest-based advertising purposes. In the event that we do so, an opportunity to opt-out of such interest-based advertising will be provided through an AdChoices link. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect non-Personal Information regarding your activities on our Sites and use it for non-interest-based advertising purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>Advertisements on Third-Party websites that contain the AdChoices link and that link to this Privacy Policy may have been directed to you based on anonymous, non-Personal Information collected by advertising partners over time and across websites. These advertisements provide a mechanism to opt-out of the advertising partners' use of this information for interest-based advertising purposes. Even if you opt-out through this service, we may still collect and use information from the advertisements for non-interest based advertising purposes, such as to determine the effectiveness of the advertisements.</p>

        <h3>3.6	Compliance with the Digital Advertising Alliance</h3>

        <p>Should WCG engage in interest-based advertising, it will endeavor to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising as managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (<a href="http://aboutads.info">http://aboutads.info</a>). As part of this service, WCG&#8217;s online advertisements may sometimes be delivered with icons that help Individuals understand how their data are being used and provide choice options to Individuals that want more control. The list of our advertising partners may be updated from time to time. To opt-out of internet-based advertising by all DAA-participating companies, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">http://www.aboutads.info/choices/</a>.</p>

        <h2>4.0	ONWARD TRANSFER</h2>

        <h3>4.1	Information We Share</h3>

        <p>WCG does not sell or otherwise disclose Personal Information about you, except as described in this Privacy Policy or as you explicitly consent. WCG may share Personal Information with our service providers, consultants and affiliates for our and our affiliates&#8217; internal business purposes or to provide you with a product or service that you have requested. Payment information will be used and shared only to effectuate your order and may be stored by a service provider for purposes of future orders. WCG may also provide Personal Information to business partners with whom we may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services we believe may be of interest to you. In such cases, our business partner&#8217;s name will appear, along with WCG&#8217;s. WCG requires our service providers and business partners to agree in writing to maintain the confidentiality and security of Personal Information they maintain on our behalf and not to use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which WCG retained them. With respect to onward transfers to Agents under Privacy Shield, Privacy Shield requires that WCG remain liable should its Agents Process Personal Information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles.</p>

        <p>We may disclose information about you: (i) if we are required to do so by law, court order or legal process; (ii) in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (iii) under the discovery process in litigation; (iv) to enforce WCG policies or contracts; (v) to collect amounts owed to WCG; (vi) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation or prosecution of suspected or actual illegal activity; or (vii) in the good faith believe that disclosure is otherwise necessary or advisable. In addition, from time to time, server logs may be reviewed for security purposes &#8211; e.g., to detect unauthorized activity on the Sites. In such cases, server log data containing IP addresses may be shared with law enforcement bodies in order that they may identify users in connection with their investigation of the unauthorized activities.</p>

        <p>We reserve the right to disclose or transfer any information we have about you in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, any reorganization, sale, lease, merger, joint venture, assignment, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of our business or of any of the business assets or shares (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceeding). Should such an event occur, WCG will endeavor to direct the transferee to use Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h3>4.2	Data Transfers</h3>

        <p>All Personal Information sent or collected via by WCG may be stored anywhere in the world, including but not limited to, in the United States, on the cloud, our servers, the servers of our affiliates or the servers of our service providers.  By providing information to WCG, you consent to the storage of your Personal Information in these locations.</p>

        <h2>5.0	RIGHTS OF ACCESS, RECTIFICATION, ERASURE AND RESTRICTION </h2>

        <p>Under Privacy Shield, you may seek confirmation regarding whether WCG is Processing Personal Information about you, request access to Personal Information, and ask that we correct, amend or delete that information where it is inaccurate or has been Processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. Where otherwise permitted by applicable law, you may use any of the methods set out in Section 8 of this Privacy Policy to request access to, receive (port), restrict Processing, seek rectification or request erasure of Personal Information held about you by WCG. Such requests will be processed in line with local laws. Although WCG makes good faith efforts to provide Individuals with access to their Personal Information, there may be circumstances in which WCG is unable to provide access, including but not limited to: where the information contains legal privilege, would compromise others&#8217; privacy or other legitimate rights, where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the Individual&#8217;s privacy in the case in question or where it is commercially proprietary. If WCG determines that access should be restricted in any particular instance, we will provide you with an explanation of why that determination has been made and a contact point for any further inquiries. To protect your privacy, WCG will take commercially reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access to or making any changes to your Personal Information.</p>

        <h2>6.0	RETENTION</h2>

        <p>WCG retains the Personal Information we receive as described in this Privacy Policy for as long as you use our Sites or as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected, provide our products and services, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements and comply with all applicable laws.</p>

        <h2>7.0	SECURITY</h2>

        <p>The security of all Personal Information provided to WCG is important to us, and WCG takes reasonable steps designed to protect your Personal Information.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or storage of information can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while WCG strives to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to WCG, and you do so at your own risk.</p>
