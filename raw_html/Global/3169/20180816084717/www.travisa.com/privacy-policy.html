            Accountability for Onward Transfer
        </h2>
        <p>
            In the event Travisa transfers personal data covered by this Privacy Policy to a third party acting as a controller, Travisa will do so consistent with any notice provided to the subjects of that data and any consent they have given, and only if the third party has given Travisa contractual assurances that it will (i) process the personal data for limited and specified purposes consistent with any consent provided by the subjects of such data; (ii) provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles and notify us if it makes a determination that it cannot do so; and (iii) cease processing of the personal data or take other reasonable and appropriate steps to remediate if it makes such a determination. If Travisa has knowledge that a third party acting as a controller is processing personal data covered by this Privacy Policy in a way that is contrary to the Privacy Shield Principles, Travisa will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            With respect to Travisa’s agents, Travisa will only transfer the personal data covered by this Privacy Policy needed for an agent to deliver to Travisa the requested product or service. In addition, Travisa will (i) permit the agent to process such personal data only for limited and specified purposes; (ii) require the agent to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles; (iii) take reasonable and appropriate steps to ensure that the agent effectively processes the Personal Data transferred in a manner consistent with Travisa’s obligations under the Privacy Shield Principles; and (iv) require the agent to notify Travisa if it makes a determination that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shied Principles. Upon receiving notice from an agent that it can no longer meet its obligation to provide the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles, Travisa will take reasonable and appropriate steps to stop and remediate unauthorized processing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travisa remains liable under the Privacy Shield Principles if an agent processes personal data covered by this Privacy Policy in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, except where Travisa is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            If Travisa transfers personal data to one of its affiliated entities within its corporate group, Travisa will take steps to ensure that such personal data is protected within the same level of protection that the Privacy Shield Principles require.

        </h2>
        <p>
            While every effort is made to provide accurate information, visa, passport, legalization, and immigration requirements are constantly changing and there may be a delay before we are advised of such changes. Therefore, we are unable to guarantee complete accuracy at all times. Processing times and fees given are solely for guidance purposes and cannot be guaranteed. Where ‘no’ visa is indicated, we recommend this information be confirmed by the carrier and the relevant embassy or consulate. Travisa recommends that visas be obtained before travel. Where information for visas upon arrival are given, we always recommend confirmation of this information with the airline and embassy or high commission prior to travel. Travel arrangements should not be confirmed prior to the visa or passport being issued, unless they are a specifically required for that consulate. In such cases, refundable arrangements should be made.
