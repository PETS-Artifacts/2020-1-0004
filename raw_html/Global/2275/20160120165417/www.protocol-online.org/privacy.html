  <h3>INTRODUCTION </h3>
  Protocol Online collects personally information about you only when you
  specifically and knowingly provide it to us.
 
  <h3>BASIC STATEMENT</h3>
  Personally information that you provide to Protocol Online sites will not be
  made available to third parties outside of Protocol Online without your
  explicit permission. Your personally information will
  be used to personalize your experience with Protocol Online Web sites.
  
  <h3>USE OF COOKIES</h3
  Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's
  hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by
  storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of
  cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide
  great features for their customers.
  <p>Protocol Online has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to
  specify unique preferences. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and
  patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of Protocol Online
  service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on
  the use of a &quot;cookie,&quot; visitors to Protocol Online always have the
  option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.
  <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your
  browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.
  However, note that some parts of Protocol Online service may not function
  properly if you refuse cookies.
  <h3>LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h3>
 Protocol Online contains many links
  to other sites. Those sites may not live up to the same privacy standards as
  Protocol Online. These sites may send their own cookies to users and
  consequently collect personal information and data that Protocol Online would
  not. When Protocol Online uses a URL redirector, if you click on a URL from a
  search result, information about the click is sent to Protocol Online and
  Protocol Online sends you to the site you clicked on. Protocol Online uses this
  information to determine how often users are satisfied with the first result
  of a query and how often they proceed to later results.
  <br><br>
  Users should be aware that when you are on Protocol Online, you could be
  directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other
  sites from Protocol Online pages that take you outside our service. These other
  sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal
  information. Always be aware of where you end up!<br><br>
  Protocol Online's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the
  operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Protocol Online's control, and
  is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental
  regulation.
 <h3>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h3>
 Protocol Online reserves the right to modify this policy
  at any time by notifying customers, via the Protocol Online site, of a new
  privacy policy.&nbsp;<br>
