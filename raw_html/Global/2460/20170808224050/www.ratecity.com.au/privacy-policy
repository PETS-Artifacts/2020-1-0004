<p>This privacy policy explains how we collect personal information and how we maintain, use and disclose that information. It also provides some detail about your privacy rights along with our general rights and obligations and our policy in relation to the personal information we keep on record. This privacy policy does not apply to parties that may be linked or associated with our website and to whom you disclose personal information. Those website owners are responsible for the privacy of the information they collect and should be contacted directly for details of their privacy policies. We are bound by the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), which are contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act). As part of our business operations we may collect your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the type of personal information we may collect and how we use, store and disclose this personal information. If you have any questions regarding this privacy policy, please contact our Privacy Officer (using the contact details below).</p>
<h3 id="your-personal-information-is-important-to-us">Your personal information is important to us</h3>
<p>We recognise that your privacy is very important and that you have a right to control personal information. Personal information is information or an opinion about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained. It includes all personal information regardless of its source. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. The following sections set out how we handle and protect your personal information and safeguard your privacy.</p>
<h3 id="what-information-do-we-collect?">What information do we collect?</h3>
<p>The types of information we keep on record will depend on the type of product or service requested by you. Generally, we keep a record of the following types of information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li>information that identifies you, such as your name and address and other information provided by you;</li>
<li>if you use a comparison tool, calculator, contact form, online survey or other tool (“Website Tool”) on our website, the information that you enter into the Website Tool;</li>
<li>your IP address for your interaction with various parts of our website. Your IP address is the identifier for your computer when you are using the internet.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not seek to collect sensitive information (for example health information or information about your racial or ethnic origin or any criminal record), unless it is necessary for our business purposes. If we do have to collect sensitive information, we will do so in accordance with the APPs. During our dealings with you, we may gather information about you relating to all products and services that we or our business partners provide to you. This information is used to help us decide how we can improve our service delivery to you. We collect and hold information about you when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete an online form or use a Website Tool;</li>
<li>provide us with your email address; or</li>
<li>access and use our services through our website.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect some statistical information about visitors to our website (for example, the number of visitors, pages viewed, types of transactions conducted, time online and documents downloaded). Some of this statistical information is collected by using cookies, but none of the statistical information we collect allows us to identify a visitor. We use this information to evaluate our website performance and continually improve our services. We may disclose this information in an aggregated form to third parties including advertisers or potential advertisers. We allow third-party companies to collect certain anonymous information when you visit our website. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioural advertising practice, you can visit <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/">networkadvertising.org</a>. Other than statistical information, we do not collect any information about you through our website unless you provide the information to us. You need not give us any of the personal information about you or any other person which may be requested in our communications with you. However, without that information, we may not be able to fulfil your request or provide you with an appropriate level of service.</p>

Every customer has a different set of needs and desires, which means no one loan or account will suit every customer, but our hope is that you will be able to find something that works for you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc2\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc2\">Can you give me a home loan?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>RateCity is not a lender, which means we don&#8217;t broker home loans. Instead, we offer a list of lenders for you to choose from and compare them based on their interest rates and fees. The process of applying for the loan is over to you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc3\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc3\">Which loan is the best one for me?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>That is ultimately up to you. RateCity does not offer personal advice and acknowledges that there is no such thing as the perfect loan. We do however help you to make an informed decision by lining up product features and costs side by side.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc4\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc4\">Does RateCity offer media commentary?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>RateCity is frequently in the media as an expert source of financial information and commentary. We also offer journalists data on interesting trends. Our commentary has appeared on Nine News, Seven News, Ten News, Sky News, the Daily Telegraph, News.com.au, the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Daily Mail and many others. If you&#8217;re a journalist with a media inquiry, please get in touch on the media number listed above.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc5\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc5\">How can I run RateCity commentary on my website?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>RateCity regularly writes commentary on financial matters for websites for free.

Every customer has a different set of needs and desires, which means no one loan or account will suit every customer, but our hope is that you will be able to find something that works for you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc2\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc2\">Can you give me a home loan?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>RateCity is not a lender, which means we don&#8217;t broker home loans. Instead, we offer a list of lenders for you to choose from and compare them based on their interest rates and fees. The process of applying for the loan is over to you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"css-accordion-panel\" id=\"acc3\">\n<h2><a href=\"#acc3\">Which loan is the best one for me?<span class=\"fa fa-plus\"></span></a></h2>\n<p>That is ultimately up to you.
