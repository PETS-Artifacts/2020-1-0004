    scope="[&quot;Despite the fact that your intention is to take care of all of your unfinished business today, you may be grappling with a love relationship situation that will steal away much of your attention. Whatever is going on between you and the one you love, you know that you must take the time to make things right or the issue will only grow in size. Do not feel guilty about tending to sensitive matters of the heart right now: Your tasks will all still be there when you return. &quot;,&quot;Your thoughts and emotions are all over the map today, making it pretty tough focusing your energies on an important love life situation. Luckily, the brilliant Gemini New Moon in your 3rd House of Distractions can help you organize your thoughts as it reminds you of the importance of picking a lane and staying in it for a while. Your romantic world will benefit if you can find a way to steady your mental musings and passionate preoccupations right now.&quot;,&quot;Take full advantage of the Gemini New Moon moving through your 2nd House Possessions today, especially if you haven&#039;t taken the time to have a conversation with your partner regarding money issues lately. Even if you both come up with a solid plan of action to manage fiscal entanglements that occasionally sully up your romantic relationship, it will still require a commitment to put your good ideas into motion right now.&quot;,&quot;If you&#039;ve been feeling mildly lost regarding your love life lately, today&#039;s Gemini New Moon moving through your 1st House of Self inspires you to settle on a specific course of action and execute it today. You must take some time to redefine the direction you want to go with a special love interest, but once you and your hungry heart are sure of what you want, creating a passionate plan to follow is crucial if you want to make it real.&quot;,&quot;You&#039;re going to want to express yourself even while the fidgety Gemini New Moon moves through your 12th House of Invisibility today thanks to the loquacious energy coming from Mercury and Venus at this moment. Your sweetheart may be frustrated with you if you push an overly controlling agenda right now, so don&#039;t put your plan of action in motion until you know that you and the one you love are on the same page. &quot;,&quot;With the jiving Gemini New Moon amping up the electricity in your 11th House of Groups, you may be full of clever banter and flirtatious charm today, magnetizing people all around you. But if you come up short in the romantic department at this moment, you probably won&#039;t be satisfied. A lighthearted attitude will keep you smiling, even when romantic payoffs seem destined to fail right now. Remind yourself that you have no idea what will happen tomorrow. Also, someone may be secretly crushed out on you without you even being aware of it! &quot;,&quot;You may be overwhelmed by your responsibilities today, making it difficult for you to focus on important matters of the heart. The changeable Gemini New Moon creates loud, informational noise and emotional static as you attempt to focus on your love relationship as best as you can, only to be distracted time and again. See if you can adjust your attitude in any way that will help you get past this tricky energy, because it&#039;s temporary and you&#039;ll soon be back in control.&quot;,&quot;It&#039;s difficult to feel satisfied about matters of the heart when you know things could be better between you and your sweetie. You&#039;re grateful for your current romantic circumstances, but now that the Gemini New Moon zaps your 9th House of Big Ideas, you&#039;re eager to amp things up with the one you love. Continue reaching for better, higher, more ambitious dreams for your love connection, because you never want to stay put or go backwards. For you, moving forward is the only way to reach the passionate joy you yearn for right now.&quot;,&quot;Your ability to forgive a lover&#039;s foibles and transform your frustrations into positive moments in your love relationship is a valuable asset which will not go unnoticed by the one you love today. The chatty Gemini New Moon moves into your subconscious 8th House of Regeneration, making it easy for you to understand the deeper realms of your special romance. You&#039;re a student of your own history and you know that being in cahoots with your paramour is the best, most progressive path forward right now.&quot;,&quot;If the one you love proves to be too chatty for you today, you might decide to pull back and retreat to a quieter place for a while. You&#039;d rather have a deep and probing conversation if it&#039;s well-balanced and fair, but to be overtaken by uncontrolled, loquacious energy that goes nowhere is something you want no part of right now. The gabby Gemini Moon amplifies the vibes in your 7th House of Relationships, making you a veritable magnet for your talkative love interest at this moment. Even if it&#039;s not easy for you, see if you can let your sweetheart in just a bit: By opening your heart and mind, you may suddenly understand their mildly convoluted message of love.&quot;,&quot;Now that the malleable Gemini New Moon throttles your 6th House of Daily Routine, you&#039;re practically sure you&#039;re able to juggle many romantic balls in your love life&#039;s chaotic world. You&#039;re tempted to move a love relationship into new territory today, even though there&#039;s already more chaos than you know what to do with. Don&#039;t expect to find balance in your romantic world until you figure out a way to set limits with your paramour right now. This is a conversation worth having sooner than later.&quot;,&quot;The way you communicate with your lover will be on your mind while the curious Gemini New Moon makes noise in your 5th House of Self-Expression today. You&#039;re eager to find new ways to share what&#039;s in your heart, especially if you use technology to express your spicy, sage self. Whether it&#039;s making waves on social media, putting together a sexy playlist or taking the ultimate romantic selfie, you&#039;re going to try to amp up your love connection in a creative and tech-y way right now.&quot;,&quot;The one you love has no idea just how angsty your emotions may be at this time, but you&#039;re not going to fess up to what&#039;s going on in your heart, at least for a while longer. The Gemini New Moon triggers your 4th House of Home an Family, making challenging conversations with your significant other even more tricky to navigate than usual at this moment. Luckily, leaning in to the love in your heart can be a major boon to your romantic world, especially in moments of crisis.&quot;]"
