                    <h4>Terms of Use</h4>

<p>Welcome to the Windsor Web Site &quot;Site&quot;. Please review the following basic rules that govern your use of our Site the &quot;Agreement&quot;. Please note that your use of our Site means that you agree to these rules.</p>

<h4>Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>

<p>We may from time to time change these rules. We will notify users of the Site of any changes by posting the revised policy reflecting them with a new effective date on this page. Your use of our Site following any such change means that you agree to the rules as changed. These rules--specifically including the &quot;Customer Information Policy&quot;, &quot;Use of Cookies&quot;, &quot;Use of IP Addresses&quot;, and &quot;Security&quot; paragraphs below--apply to this website only and not to any other website or business activity of Windsor Inc. or any of its divisions.</p>

<h4>Customer Information Policy</h4>

<p>Windsor does not intend, and the site is not designed to collect personal information from those users under the age of 13. If you are under 13 years old, you should not provide personal information to our site or in connection with the services. Windsor recognizes that it must maintain and use customer information responsibly. The information collected is used to help us respond to customer inquiries, send emails about sales and events, and other marketing and promotional materials through the mail, contact contest winners and/or ship and bill orders. The information also helps us in determining what products appeal to our customers so we can better merchandise our site.</p>

<p>Windsor collects personal information necessary to process an order, a contest entry or a request to receive promotional emails from the consumer. This information includes name, address, city, state, zip code, phone number, email address, gender optional and date of birth optional. For those users who have opted to register their personal profile with the Site by setting up an account, the above information, including additional Ship To addresses, can be reviewed and maintained by the customer by accessing it through the My Account link in the top navigation bar of the Sites pages. For those customers who have not registered a maintainable account on the site, they may contact Windsor customer service at 1-888-494-6376 to have their information updated as needed.</p>

<p>We may use customer information for marketing and promotional purposes. Each promotional email we send comes with a link that enables our customers to unsubscribe or remove themselves from our mailing list. In addition, we may from time to time make customer information available to other carefully screened companies. Categories of companies with which we may share information include other companies that we believe offer products and services that our customers may be interested in, either directly or through companies that market information about potential customers to other suppliers of products or services. If you would like to make sure that we make every effort not to share your email address or other information with third parties, just send an email message to info@windsorstore.com.</p>

<p>When we offer contests or promotions, or join with other companies to do so, visitors who choose to participate in these contests and promotions may be asked to provide personal information to participate. That information may then be used by us and any company offering the contest or promotions to notify winners or to fulfill promotional obligations. We may use third parties to perform services such as mailing marketing and promotional materials on our behalf. We will supply customer information to those third parties to the extent necessary to enable them to perform the services we have engaged them to provide.</p>

<h4>Third Party Integrated Solutions</h4>

<p>In addition to the third-party service providers discussed elsewhere in this policy, Windsor uses carefully selected third-party solution providers on its website to offer specific functionality that help improve the shopping experience for its customers. As a result, there are occasions where the Site must share customer information with one or more of those providers in order for their software to function as expected and provide our customers with the expected benefit. In addition to the third-party payment and email opt-in services which are made available through the site, Windsor currently uses the third-party providers listed below, each of which has access to some customer information as described. The companies listed have committed to Windsor to adhere to our Customer Information Policy and, in some cases, have also listed a link to their own company policy.</p>

<h4>MyBuys:</h4>

<p>Windsor uses MyBuys to collect information regarding consumer preferences related to Windsors&#39; products and the Site in order to merchandise the Site effectively and make product recommendations to the Site&#39;s customers. MyBuys may use cookies and transparent GIF files to collect information on the Windsors website as part of the service. Consumers may review MyBuys&#39; privacy policy at http://www.mybuys.com/privacy.html.</p>

<h4>International Checkout:</h4>

<p>Windsor allows international shoppers to obtain our products through the use of International Checkout. When a customer on the Site chooses the International Checkout option, the products in the Site&#39;s shopping cart are transferred to an International Checkout cart. The transaction then takes place completely on the InternationalCheckout.com website.</p>

<h4>Your California Privacy Rights</h4>

<p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as S.B. 27, allows our California customers to request certain information regarding our disclosures, if any, of personally identifiable information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us at either info@windsorstore.com or Windsor: Attn: Internet Dept., 4533 Pacific Blvd., Vernon, CA 90058 and include your name and the address to which you would like us to respond.
