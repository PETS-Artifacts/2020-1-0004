We also provide your personally identifiable information to the franchisee operating the MY GYM  location in your area or in which you have scheduled a class or arranged a birthday party or other event.  Such third party entities will be restricted from further distributing your personally identifiable information and may be obligated to a written confidentiality agreement that is at least as protective of your personally identifiable information as the terms of this Privacy Policy and they will not be permitted to further distribute your personally identifiable information. However, such third party entities may use your personally identifiable information to send you marketing or promotional materials. We also will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to enforce the Terms of Use or to protect the safety and security of our users.

                    <br /><br />We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction. MY GYM may use firewalls, internal restrictions, password protection and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

                    <br /><hr /><br /><b>10.Consent.</b>
                    <br /><br />Your use including, without limitation, to your provision of personally identifiable information constitutes your consent to our collection and use of your personal information in this Privacy Policy.

            <br /><br />We may use small text files called cookies or similar technologies to improve overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the web browser of a user's hard drive. Cookies do not store or contain personally identifiable information. Cookies enable us to “relate” a user’s activities on and visits to our Site. Cookies must be enabled for you to use certain areas of the Site.
            <br /><br />Third party advertisements on the Site may also contain cookies. MY GYM does not control these cookies. Users should review the privacy policy of the third party to determine whether and how the third party advertisers use cookies.
            <br /><br />Users can program their web browsers to warn them every time a cookie is sent. Users can also program their web browsers to refuse cookies. Please note that without cookies users may not have access to certain services or content on the Site.

            <br /><br />The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, IP addresses, External Websites (defined below in Section 7) linked to, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

            <br /><hr /><br /><b>7. Disclosure.</b>
            <br /><br />We may disclose your personally identifiable information that we collect and the data generated by cookies to our parent, subsidiary or affiliate entities within our corporate family, our franchisees, third party partner entities and the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us.  For example, we may provide your personally identifiable information to an organization in order to complete a service (e.g., process your payment).  We also provide your personally identifiable information to the franchisee operating the MY GYM  location in your area or in which you have scheduled a class or arranged a birthday party or other event.  Such third party entities will be restricted from further distributing your personally identifiable information and may be obligated to a written confidentiality agreement that is at least as protective of your personally identifiable information as the terms of this Privacy Policy and they will not be permitted to further distribute your personally identifiable information. However, such third party entities may use your personally identifiable information to send you marketing or promotional materials. We also will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or other government authority. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to enforce the Terms of Use or to protect the safety and security of our users. We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any other company or organization except we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation or other corporate reorganization in which MY GYM participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of MY GYM's assets to which this Site relates.

            <br /><hr /><br /><b>8. Links to Third Party Sites.</b>
            <br /><br />The Site may provide links to other websites or resources operated by other companies over which MY GYM does not own, operate or control ("External Websites"). Such links do not constitute an endorsement by MY GYM of those External Websites. You acknowledge and agree that MY GYM is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that MY GYM is not responsible for the content of such External Websites. Your use of External Websites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies located on the linked to External Websites. You should review the privacy policies and terms of use of any External Websites to determine how these websites collect and/or use your personally identifiable information.

            <br /><hr /><br /><b>9. Security.</b>
            <br /><br />We may employ procedural and technological measures, consistent with industry practice. Such measures are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction. MY GYM may use firewalls, internal restrictions, password protection and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of your personally identifiable information.

            <br /><hr /><br /><b>10.Consent.</b>
            <br /><br />Your use including, without limitation, to your provision of personally identifiable information constitutes your consent to our collection and use of your personal information in this Privacy Policy.
