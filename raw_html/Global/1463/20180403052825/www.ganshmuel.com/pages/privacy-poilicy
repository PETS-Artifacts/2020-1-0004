But, we do receive and/or collect Personal Information from you in the following ways:</li>
		<li><u>&#39;Contact Us&#39; Information</u>.

		<li>We may use your designated email address to respond to a &quot;Contact Us&quot;.</li>
		<li>We may transfer your Personal Information to our subsidiaries or affiliated companies for the purpose of storing or processing such information on our behalf.

We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information.</li>
		<li>We may disclose your Personal Information or any information you submitted via the Site if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is helpful or reasonably necessary to: (i) comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our Terms, including investigations of potential violations thereof; (iii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud or security issues; or (iv) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Gan Shmuel, our users, yourself or the public.</li>

If you would like to delete or correct any of your other Personal Information that we may be storing, you may submit an access request by sending an email to <a href="mailto:marketing@ganshmuel.com">marketing@ganshmuel.com</a>. Your email should include adequate details of your request</li>
	<li><strong>Links to and Interaction with Third Party Products. </strong>The Site may enable you to interact with or contain links to your Third Party Account and other third party websites, mobile software applications and services that are not owned or controlled by us (each a &ldquo;<strong>Third Party Service</strong>&rdquo;).

	<li><strong>Merger, Sale or Bankruptcy.</strong> In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, or in the event of bankruptcy or a comparable event, we reserve the right to transfer or assign Personal Information in connection with the foregoing events.</li>

	<li><strong>Our California Do Not Track Notice.</strong></li>
	<li>We do not track consumers over time and across third party websites and therefore do not respond to Do Not Track signals. We do not allow third parties to collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer&rsquo;s online activities over time and across different web sites when a consumer uses the Site.</li>
	<li><strong>Commitment. </strong>We are committed to protecting your privacy. Protecting your privacy online is an evolving area, and we are constantly evolving our Service to meet these demands.
