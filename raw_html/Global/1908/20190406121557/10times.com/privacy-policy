    When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you
    access Services from a mobile device), we may collect and process
    information about your mobile device’s GPS location (including the
    latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the
    location information is recorded to customize the Services with
    location-based information and features (for example, to inform you about
    events in your area). Some of these services require your personal data for
    the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID
    and other information we hold about you.
</p><p><strong>How Long Do we Keep this Data? </strong>
    We keep this data for no longer than is reasonably necessary for providing
    services to you. If you wish to use the particular feature, you will be
    asked to consent to your data being used for this purpose. You can withdraw
    your consent at any time by disabling the GPS or other location-tracking
    functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this.
</p><p><br><strong>Cookies and Other Electronic Tools</strong></p><p><strong>Do we use Cookies? </strong>
    We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, pixel tags,
    web beacons, mobile device IDs, “flash cookies” and similar files or
    technologies to collect and store information in respect to your use of the
    Services and third party websites.
</p><p><strong>What is a Cookie? </strong>
    A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer that enables
    us to recognize you (for example, as a registered user) when you visit our
    website, store your preferences and settings, enhance your experience by
    delivering content and advertising specific to your interests, perform
    research and analytics, track your use of our Services, and assist with
    security and administrative functions. Cookies may be persistent or stored
    only during an individual session. A pixel tag (also called a web beacon or
    clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly
    on a webpage (or an online ad or email), and is used to count or track
    things like activity on a webpage or ad impressions or clicks, as well as
    to access cookies stored on users’ computers. 10times uses pixel tags to
    measure the popularity of our various pages, features and services. We also
    may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine
    whether the message has been opened and for other analytics.
</p><p><strong>How can Cookies be disabled? </strong>
    Most browsers are set to automatically allow cookies. Please note it may be
    possible to disable some (but not all) cookies through your device or
    browser settings, but doing so may interfere with certain functionality on
    the Services. Major browsers provide users with various options when it
    comes to cookies. Users can usually set their browsers to block all
    third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies
    collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block all
    cookies (including first-party cookies such as the ones 10times uses to
    collect search activity information about its users), or block specific
    cookies. To modify your cookie settings, please visit your browser’s help
    settings. You will need to opt out on each browser and each device you use
    to access the Services. Flash cookies operate differently than browser
    cookies and cannot be removed or blocked via web browser settings. By using
    our Services with your browser set to accept cookies you are consenting to
    our use of cookies.
</p><p>
    Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised
    through the Services, including social media services, may also use cookies
    or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for
    information about their cookies and other practices. We do not control the
    practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their
    interactions with you.
</p><p><strong>Information from Third Parties</strong></p><p>
    We may collect, process and store your user ID associated with any social
    media account (such as your Facebook, LinkedIn and Google account) that you
    use to sign into the Services or connect with or use with the Services.
</p><p>
    When you sign in to your account with your social media account
    information, or otherwise connect to your social media account with the

    partners, marketers, third-party websites, and researchers, and combine
    that information with information which we collect from or about you.

    We may anonymize and/or de-identify information collected from you through
    the Services or via other means, including via the use of third-party web
    analytic tools as described below. As a result, our use and disclosure of

    Privacy Policy, and it may be used and disclosed to others without
    limitation.
