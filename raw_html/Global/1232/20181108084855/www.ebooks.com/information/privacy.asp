			<h2>eBooks.com acts as agent</h2>

				<p>		
					In addition to operating as an online retailer of ebooks in its own right, eBooks.com also provides sales, fulfillment, payment processing and help-desk services to other companies on an agency basis. This service is most commonly provided to book publishers. We will make it clear to you whenever we are so acting as an agent, by showing the brand of the other company at the top of our web pages. The other company's brand will be followed by the words "Powered by eBooks.com" or similar. When we sell you an ebook in our capacity as agent, the vendor of record for that purchase will be the other company. When so acting as an agent, we may provide to the other company your personally identifiable information, so that they may continue to service your needs in the event that the partnership between eBooks.com and the other company ceases. If you opt-in to receive marketing information we may pass your information onto our partners, whom we act as agents, so they may continue that service. If you do not want us to share your personally identifiable information with these companies, contact us at privacy@ebooks.com

<h3>What Are Cookies?</h3>
<p>eBooks.com places tiny text files called cookies onto your computer, tablet or mobile device. This is standard practice for almost all websites.</p>
<p>Cookies are not harmful to your computer and are an essential part of online shopping. They allow us to give you a more efficient customer experience.</p>
<h3>What Are Cookies Used For?</h3>
<p>There are two main types of cookie; we call them "first party" and "third party" cookies.</p>
<p>First party cookies are small data files that we use for things such as keeping track of what you've put in your basket and remembering who you are when you return to our site. We don't save personal information such as credit card details in the cookies we create.</p>
<p>Third party cookies are set on our behalf. The most important of these are Google and Commission Junction, who display text or banner adverts on our behalf on a number of other reputable websites or in Internet search results. Commission Junction does not collect personal data from our website. Because our website uses Google Analytics to help us optimise our web pages and better understand the website&rsquo;s traffic, if you visit us while you&rsquo;re logged in to your Google account (like Gmail, for example) then some of your browsing activity on our site may be &hellip;</p>
