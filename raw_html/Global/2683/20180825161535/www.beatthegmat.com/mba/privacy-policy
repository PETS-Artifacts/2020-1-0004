<div id="cookies">
<h2><b>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</b></h2>
</div>
<p>A cookie is a commonly used automated data collection tool. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer or device by websites that you visit or HTML-formatted emails you open, in order to make websites work, or to work more efficiently.</p>
<p>We may use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags or other similar technologies on our Websites or emails to, among other things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tailor information presented to you based on your browsing preferences, such as language and geographical region;</li>
<li>Collect statistics regarding your Website usage;</li>
<li>Provide us with information to support technical functionality of service, improve the Website experience and measure marketing effectiveness; and</li>
<li>In some cases, to enable a third party to deliver future advertising for our products and services to you when you visit certain Websites owned by such third parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several different kinds of cookies, and should we be deploying cookies we (or a third party provider be deploying them in connection with our e-commerce activities) would be using one of the following common types of cookies, which may be persistent cookies or session cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Essential cookies</i></b> are necessary to provide you with services and features available through our Websites. Without these cookies, services you may need, such as shopping carts or e-billing, cannot be provided.</li>
<li><b><i>Analytics or customization cookies</i></b> collect information that is either used in aggregate form to help us understand how the Website is being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize the Website for you.</li>
<li><b><i>Advertising cookies and tracking scripts</i></b> are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly delivered and, in some cases, featuring ads based on your interests.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the Website includes a cookie management tool, you will typically find a hover button at the bottom of your screen.</p>
<p>If in the future you do not wish to receive cookies you may be able to refuse them by adjusting your browser settings to reject cookies. If you do so, we may be unable to offer you some of our functionalities, services or support. If you have previously visited our Websites, you may also have to delete any existing cookies from your browser.</p>
<p><i>Do-Not-Track.</i>  There are different ways you can prevent tracking of your online activity. One of them is setting a preference in your browser that alerts websites you visit that you do not want them to collect certain information about you. This is referred to as a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) signal.</p>
<p>Please note that our Websites may not recognize or take action in response to DNT signals from web browsers. At this time, there is no universally accepted standard for what a company should do when a DNT signal is detected. In the event a final standard is established, we will assess how to appropriately respond to these signals.</p>

On behalf of the Website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website, compiling reports on Website activity for Website operators and providing other services relating to Website activity and internet usage to the Website provider. Google will not associate the IP address transmitted by your browser with any other data stored by Google.</p>

<h2><b>Storage, Use and Sharing of Information</b></h2>
</div>
<p><i>Our Use of Personal Data.  </i>We may use Personal Data collected by us for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>to contact you if you have requested information or communication from us;</li>
<li>to determine the country in which you are located for compliance purposes (including without limitation export compliance);</li>
<li>and for security, anti-piracy, and fraud prevention purposes;</li>
<li>to help verify that existing personal information about you in our possession is accurate and complete;</li>
<li>to provide you with product updates and upgrades, special offers, pricing information, newsletters, and other information, either on our own behalf or in some cases on behalf of a partner or client acting as their agent, where you have consented to receive it;</li>
<li>to undertake any other promotional activities where you have previously consented to such promotional activities;</li>
<li>in connection with keys, access codes or other information as may be required to permit you to access the Websites or services of our partners to receive products, updates or services;</li>
<li>for the purposes identified in a specific Supplemental Privacy Notice posted on the page or area of this Ecommerce Engine where you provided that information;</li>
<li>to verify compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations;</li>
<li>to provide you, to the extent permitted by law, with a personalized shopping experience;</li>
<li>to establish an account for future purchases by you if you have consented to the creation of an account;</li>
<li>to provide you with effective customer service (which may to the extent and in a manner permitted by applicable law, include contacting visitors who commence but do not complete a checkout process to follow up on the incomplete session or to see if there was a problem with their use of this Ecommerce Engine), and/or technical support;</li>
</ul>
<p>If you visit this Ecommerce Engine for the purposes of conducting a purchase transaction, we require and will process certain of your Personal Data for the purposes listed below in order for us to perform our obligations under such purchase transaction and corresponding contract. If you do not provide the required Personal Data, you will be unable to complete such purchase transaction on this Ecommerce Engine:</p>
<p>○       to take, verify, process or deliver your order, process or obtain payment, verify your tax or tax exempt status, contest chargebacks, determine your eligibility for a line of credit, or notify you of the status of your order;</p>
<p>○       to register your purchase with the manufacturer or service provider for warranty, technical support or similar purposes;</p>
<p>○       to provide notice of your purchase to the provider of an online service for which you purchase a service use right from us, for example, in order for the service provider to enable your access to the service and provide updates; and</p>
<p>○       to facilitate the renewal of subscriptions for products or services.</p>
<p><i>Our Use of Anonymous Information.  </i>We may use anonymous information (i.e. information that does not allow direct or indirect identification of the individual to whom such information relates) collected by us:</p>
<ul>
<li>to personalize and support your use of this Ecommerce Engine, our services, and/or the services of our partners;</li>
<li>to improve this Ecommerce Engine, the customer experience, our advertising systems, and our products and services;</li>
<li>for fraud prevention purposes, such as device fingerprinting;</li>
<li>to identify actions or transactions as originating through an affiliate marketing or referral program;</li>
<li>to deliver targeted advertisements on this Ecommerce Engine and other Websites and/or ecommerce solutions;</li>
<li>to provide reporting to our current and prospective partners and service providers; and</li>
<li>for statistical or research and analysis purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, we may anonymize Personal Data by removing any information that identifies you specifically, and use the rest for the purposes set forth above.</p>
<p><i>Our Partners.</i> When we make products available for sale through an Ecommerce Engine, we are doing so as an independent e-commerce reseller of, or service provider for, the partner whose name and/or logo appears as part of the particular Ecommerce Engine. In connection with your purchase of a product or service through an online store we operate that is co-branded with our partner’s branding, we will provide certain of the Personal Data and/or anonymous information you provide in connection with your purchase to that partner for reporting purposes, to allow our partner or its service provider to register your purchase, to enable your access to products or services provided by our partner or its suppliers, to facilitate warranty, technical support or after-sales service, to allow our partner or its subcontractor to send communications to you if you have previously consented to receive them, to allow our partner or its service provider to provide services in connection with this Ecommerce Engine such as customer support or single sign-on functionality on this Ecommerce Engine and our partner’s Website, or for similar purposes in order to fulfill obligations to you.</p>
<p>We may also provide certain of the Personal Data you provide in connection with your purchase to the publisher or manufacturer of a product you purchase, or operator of a service for which you purchase a service use right from us, if different than the partner whose name and/or logo appears on this Ecommerce Engine.  The privacy policy of our partner, and of the publisher, manufacturer or operator of the product or service you purchase, will govern how that party uses and protects any of your Personal Data that we provide to them.</p>
<p><i>Our Service Providers</i>. We use other companies, which may include but not limited to present or future corporate affiliates, to provide joint services or certain services to us or on our behalf and help us to operate our business. We may share your information with our service providers in connection with their provision of services to us.</p>
<p>We may also allow these companies to use anonymous information, and to use aggregated Personal Data on an anonymous basis (i.e., where the aggregated data cannot identify you personally), for their business purposes.  We will not share your Personal Data with our affiliates or unrelated third parties to use for their own marketing purposes without your consent. We select our partners and service providers on the basis of their security and confidentiality commitments and their compliance with EU Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p><i>To Comply With Legal Requirements, Cooperate With Law Enforcement, Prevent Fraud and Other Crimes, and Protect Legal Rights, Ecommerce Engine, You and Others</i>. To the extent not expressly prohibited by applicable law, we may disclose Personal Data we collect on this Ecommerce Engine without notifying you when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate: (a)  to comply with the law or a regulatory requirement; (b) to comply with governmental, administrative or judicial process, requirement or order, such as a subpoena or court order; (c) to cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental investigations (without necessarily requiring the law enforcement or government agency requesting the information to formally serve us with a subpoena); (d) to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; (e) to enforce a contract; to protect the legal rights, property or safety of Beat The GMAT, its corporate affiliates, and their respective employees, clients and partners and agents, other users or the public in general; or (f) to protect your vital interests if determined necessary by us. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we may share our server logs – which contain visitors’ IP addresses – with the appropriate investigative authorities who may use that information to trace and identify individuals. We also reserve the right to report to appropriate law enforcement or government agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe are or may be in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations without providing notice to you.</p>
<p><i>In Connection With Corporate Events</i>. If one of our corporate affiliates or a third party has acquired our business, specific assets or the business of one of our operating divisions through which you have provided information to us, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation, your Personal Data may become owned by that company in compliance with applicable EU Data Protection Laws. In that event, the acquiring company’s use of your Personal Data will still be subject to this Privacy Statement, any applicable Supplemental Privacy Notices, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.</p>
<p>Pursuant to EU Data Protection Laws, we retain your Personal Data only to achieve the purposes set out in this Privacy Statement. We will therefore retain Personal Data as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal Data used for shipping and billing: 2 years after your last order ;</li>
<li>Payment Information: only for the duration of the payment ;</li>
<li>Personal Data used for marketing purposes: 3 years after the last contact with you (e.g. : request for information)</li>
</ul>
<p>After these periods, we will delete the corresponding Personal Data.</p>

<h2><b>Your Choices</b></h2>
</div>
<p>Beat The GMAT respects your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use and disclose information about you. We generally ask you to indicate your choices at the time, and on the page, where you provide your Personal Data.</p>
<p>When you provide Personal Data, we may offer you a choice as to whether you would like to receive further communications from us and/or from our partners via a box to tick for example, such as communications related to updates, upgrades, special offers and pricing. You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. If you decide you no longer want to receive promotional messages from us, you may let us know by e-mailing us at remove@beatthegmat.com or by following any unsubscribe link in our e-mails; please specify which consent you are revoking in your e-mail to us. Please note, however, if you give us permission to add your contact information to our partner’s mailing list and later withdraw your permission, you will have to contact our partner (or use the “opt-out” provided in the e-mails our partner sends you) to have your name removed from our partner’s mailing lists.</p>

<div id="security">
<h2><b>Security of Information</b></h2>
</div>
<p>We are committed to keeping Personal Data secure. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative safeguards reasonably designed to protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access and disclosure. When we collect or transmit sensitive information such as a financial account number, we use industry standard methods to protect that information. It is important that you understand, however, that no Ecommerce Engine, Website, database or system is completely secure or “hacker proof.” You are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to protect your Personal Data against unauthorized disclosure or misuse, for example, by protecting your password. Different countries have different privacy laws and requirements. Please know, however, that no matter where your Personal Data is collected, used, transferred or stored, if it was collected through this Ecommerce Engine, it will be protected by us in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement, any Supplemental Privacy Notices that apply to you, and applicable EU Data Protection Laws.</p>
<p><a href="#toc"> </a></p>
<div id="privacy_shield">
<h2><b>Privacy Shield</b></h2>
</div>
<p>Beat The GMAT has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/">www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</a> for more information and to file a complaint.  The Council of Better Business Bureaus has committed to respond to complaints and to provide appropriate recourse at no cost to you.</p>
<p>If you are a consumer, any dispute relating to the Privacy Statement or to its interpretation may be referred to the Consumer Affairs Ombudsman as provided for by the provisions of L611-1 and following of the Consumer Code and as indicated on the tab of the Ecommerce Engine “Mediation”. Failing such agreement, the dispute shall be submitted to the competent court of the place where you live, or to the place where the service is performed, or to the place of the harmful event, at your option.</p>
<p>If neither we nor the Council of Better Business Bureaus/ Consumer Affairs Ombudsman resolves your complaint, you may pursue binding arbitration through the Privacy Shield Panel. To learn more about the Privacy Shield Panel, click here: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=F-The-Arbitration-Panel">https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=F-The-Arbitration-Panel</a>.</p>
<p>As explained here we sometimes provide Personal Data to third parties to perform services on our behalf. If we transfer Personal Data received under the Privacy Shield to a third party, the third party’s access, use, and disclosure of the Personal Data must also be in compliance with our Privacy Shield obligations, and we will remain liable under the Privacy Shield for any failure to do so by the third party unless we prove we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. Therefore, we will select third parties on the basis of their adherence to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework or that have executed an agreement based on the Standard Model Clauses issued by the European Commission.</p>
<p>You can review our Privacy Shield registration here: <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/list">https://www.privacyshield.gov/list</a>.</p>
<p>We are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We may be required to disclose Personal Data that we handle under the Privacy Shield in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
