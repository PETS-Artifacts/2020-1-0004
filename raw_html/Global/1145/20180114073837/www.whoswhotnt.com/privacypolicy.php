Prestige Business Publications may also monitor, on an anonymous aggregate basis, patterns of use in connection with emails that it sends out, including which links are clicked on in our email communications, so that we may use such information to better personalize the content of the Site and our mailings for our users. All such information will be protected in accordance with our Privacy Policy. We may also automatically collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help diagnose problems and for system administration. Prestige Business Publications reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of the Site.</p>

In addition, we may report aggregate information to our advertisers. Such aggregate information will not specifically identify any individual user of the Site.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to disclose any information if such action is necessary (a) to conform to the requirements of the law or to comply with legal process or subpoena served on WhosWhoTnT.com, (b) to protect and defend the legal rights or property of WhosWhoTnT.com, the Site, or its users, or (c) in an emergency, to protect the health and safety of its users or the general public.
