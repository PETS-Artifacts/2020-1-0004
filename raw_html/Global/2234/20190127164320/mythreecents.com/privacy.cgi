<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
<strong>Last Updated:  December 2, 2018</strong>
</p>
<p>
This Privacy Policy describes how MyThreeCents ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information collected through our website www.mythreecents.com.com or when you otherwise interact with us (the "Services"). 
</p>
<p>
We may change this policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy, and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a statement to our homepage or sending you a notification). Please check this page when you access the services to stay informed about our information practices and the choices available to you. 
</p>
<h2>Collection of Information</h2>


<h3>Information You Provide Us</h3>


<p>We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, we collect information when you create an account, participate in any interactive features of the Services, write a review, respond to a survey, fill out a form, participate in a contest or promotion, communicate with us via third party social media sites, request customer support, interact with us via chat, or otherwise communicate with us. The types of information we may collect include your name, email address, postal address, phone number and any other information you choose to provide. </p>


<h3>A Note about Customer Reviews</h3>

<p>
If you disclose information through the Services such as through a customer review, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge or permission. For this reason, we recommend you do not post personal information about yourself or others. For more information about user terms and guidelines, please visit our <a href="/agreement.cgi">Terms of Use</a>.
</p>

<h3>Information We Collect from Other Sources</h3>

<p>
If you create or log into your account through a social media site, we may have access to certain information from that site, such as your name, user ID, account information, information that you have made public, and friends lists, according to the social media site's data practices and your privacy settings on that social media site.
</p>
<p>
We may also collect demographic information about you from third parties, including data brokers, mailing list providers, and publicly available sources. We may also receive information about you from our business partners, such as those companies who have created an account with us as Accredited Members.

<li>Carry-out any other purpose described to you at the time the information was collected.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How we share information:</h2>


<p>
We may share information we receive about you as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:
</p>

<ul>
<li>We may share information we receive about you with our service providers who need access to such information to provide services to us on our behalf.</li>

<li>We may disclose information if we have a good faith belief that we are required to do so to comply with the law or legal process, such as in response to subpoenas, courts orders, or requests by government authorities, law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, including lawful requests by public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</li>
<li>We may also disclose information if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our user agreements or policies, or to protect the rights, property or safety of MyThreeCents or others.</li>

<h2>Online analytics and tailored advertising: </h2>


<p>
We may allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the internet and in applications. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of the Services and other websites and applications, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by us and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our Services and other websites, and better understand your online activity. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
To opt-out of cookies or other trackers, please see "Your Choices" below or visit our <a href="/cookie_policy.cgi">Cookie Policy</a>.
</p>

<h2>Links: </h2>

<p>
The Services may contain links to other websites and services. We are not responsible for the privacy policy or other practices employed by sites and services linked to or from our Services nor the information or content available there.
</p>

<h2>Security: </h2>

<p>
We use reasonable measures to help protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. 
</p>

<h2>Transfer of Information to the United States: </h2>

<p>
The Services are hosted in the United States. Therefore, we and our service providers may transfer your information to, or store or access it in, jurisdictions that may not provide equivalent levels of data protection as your home jurisdiction. We will take steps to ensure that your personal data receives an adequate level of protection in the jurisdictions in which we process it.
</p>

<p>
When we transfer personal data from the European Union or Switzerland to the United States, we comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss - U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. MyThreeCents has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
</p>

<p>
In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about our processing of your personal data. EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our compliance with the Privacy Shield program should first contact us.  We have further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to JAMS, an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim">https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim</a> for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.
</p>

<p>
Under certain conditions, you may be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint. MyThreeCents is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.
</p>

<p>
If we share personal data transferred to the U.S. under the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes such data on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
</p>
