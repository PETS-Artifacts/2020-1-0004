Construction works for a new protective shelter which will be mounted over the remains of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are currently underway at the site. 30 years have passed since the accident and life has not returned to normal in the disaster-affected area. The levels of radiation remain high in the surroundings of the nuclear plant, though life does seem to be slowly recovering. There are very few people living in the villages near the Chernobyl nuclear site, and much of the land is gradually being turned into farmers fields. The flora and fauna is present and alive and a farm is operating 37 kms away from the reactor site. The farm is located near a radiation ecology reserve and has more than 260 horses and 55 cows being raised for sale there. Workers of the reserve claim that during all activities, the content of radionuclides is monitored.  EPA\/SERGEY DOLZHENKO PLEASE REFER TO ADVISORY NOTICE (epa05265084) FOR FULL PACKAGE TEXT",
