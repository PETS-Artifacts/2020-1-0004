<p>As part of our on-going efforts to ensure the best possible experience for all visitors to the Website, we collect data from browsers to aggregate statistical information. This includes the type of browser being used, its level of HTML support and what platform it is on. This Privacy Policy also applies to visitors to the Website that have agreed to receive e-mail marketing from Recipe4Living.com, but have not separately registered to become a Recipe4Living.com member. The personal profile information that you submit to Recipe4Living.com remains your property, but by submitting that information to Recipe4Living.com, its partners including, but not limited to, SilverNGold, Dealhighway.com, ConsumerValueDirect.com, SmartBrands, BargainSpot, SavingsAvalanche, Deal-zone.com, Couponandgifts.com, AskVinegarJoe.com, TVNewsDaily.com, AsmileADay.com, TensionBusters.com, YourDailySmile.com, YourSelfDaily.com, YourtimeDaily.com and/or any and all other affiliates, you Recipe4Living.com the right to use that information for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>When visitors elect to become members of Recipe4Living.com, we request that they provide additional, personally-identifiable information. This includes name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, age bracket, day and month of birth. All registrants may receive e-mail confirming their registration, and subsequent correspondence. Certain information, such as your e-mail address, is collected in order to, among other functions, verify your identity in the future within our database. When you select to receive information about offerings from a third party company during the registration process, we will share your personal information with that third party company to carry out your information request. Recipe4Living.com may also use such information to directly market certain offers to you (via e-mail, direct mail and/or telemarketing), to monitor compliance with our Terms and Conditions and for content improvement and feedback purposes. We may sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may join together with other businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members. These businesses may include, but are not limited to: (a) providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation; (b) e-mail marketers; and (c) telemarketers.</p>
<p>We may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, removing duplicate information from customer lists, analyzing data, and providing marketing analysis. These agents have access to our members' personal information as needed to perform their functions for Recipe4Living.com, but we do not permit them to use our members' personal information for other purposes.</p>
<p>Recipe4Living.com reserves the right to release current or past member information in the event Recipe4Living.com believes that the membership is being or has been used in violation of the Website's terms and conditions, or to commit unlawful acts, if the information is subpoenaed, if Recipe4Living.com is sold or acquired, or when Recipe4Living.com deems it necessary or appropriate. By agreeing to these conditions, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party, when Recipe4Living.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate including, without limitation, sharing your e-mail address with other third-parties for suppression purposes in compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, as amended from time to time, and Federal Trade Commission enabling regulations.</p>
<p>In addition, by registering at the Website, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR &sect;310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the "Rule"). Notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed at the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call List, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing in accordance with the Rule.</p>
<p>From time to time, we may receive personal information about you from outside sources and add it to your existing registration information on file at the Website. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising and/or special offers that we think may be of interest you).</p>
<p>We may also collect other information such as your IP address, domain names, access times and referring third party website addresses. This information is used by Recipe4Living.com for the operation of the Website, to maintain the quality of our offerings, and to provide general aggregate statistics regarding Recipe4Living.com. Such information is not personally identifiable.</p>
<p>We also collect information such as the identification of the server that your computer is logged onto and whether you opened a Recipe4Living.com e-mail message delivered to you. We also may compare our member list to various lists received from other third party companies, in an effort to avoid sending identical or similar e-mail messages to our members.</p>

Financial Information that you disclose to Recipe4Living.com is used to confirm your age and to bill you for shipping our products and services. To the extent that customer credit card-specific information is collected by Recipe4Living.com, said information will be kept in confidence and will not be shared with any third parties (other than consumer credit agencies) without your prior informed consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Recipe4Living.com reserves the right to share with third parties the fact that we have credit card information on file for specific customers but we will not share the specific credit card information with third parties without your prior informed consent.</p>
