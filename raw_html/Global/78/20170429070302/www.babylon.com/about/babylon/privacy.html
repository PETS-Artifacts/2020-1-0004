Importantly, a cookie does not allow us to obtain any personally identifiable information (such as your real name or address) unless you have specifically provided such information when using the Web Sites or the Software. The search feature sends a request to our servers from time to time including while processing a search query that you have inputted or a third party software download that you have approved This request includes the keyword query, source (Toolbar, IE bar, related links, etc…) and/or third party software offer details you approved and all HTTP data transferred automatically by the browser (IP Address, User Agent, Cookies, web beacons etc…).

Such information is recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. If any of the Web Sites or the Software is ever sold or all or substantially all of the assets relating to a Web Site or the Software are transferred to another entity, we may transfer all information provided by or collected from you, including personally identifiable information, in order to ensure continuity of your service. We will disclose information, including personally identifiable information, data acquired by cookies, and other data, where required by a subpoena, interception order or other lawful process.
