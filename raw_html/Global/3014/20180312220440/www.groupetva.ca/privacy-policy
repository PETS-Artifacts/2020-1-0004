(hereinafter “TVA”, “we”, “us” and “our”) wishes to inform you of the privacy practices and policies implemented on this site and the sites of TVA’s authorized affiliates (hereinafter the “Site”). More specifically, this privacy policy (hereinafter the “Policy”) describes the way we in which we collect, use, disclose and process information concerning you.<br />
TVA is aware of concerns regarding the circulation of personal information and navigational data on the internet and aims to cooperate with you to ensure that your privacy is respected and protected. For this reason, we wish to inform you of the type of information we collect when you visit our Site and when, how and why we collect this information. We wish to specify that TVA restricts both the quantity and nature of the information collected. We therefore ask you to read the following Policy closely and to come back periodically to learn of any changes we may have made.<br />
 <br /><strong>PERSONAL INFORMATION:</strong><br />
 <br /><strong>1. </strong><strong>What is </strong><strong>« </strong><strong>Personal Information </strong><strong>»</strong><strong> and how is it collected?</strong><br />
Personal Information refers to information about an identifiable individual.  That is, information that could be used to specifically identify you as the user, such as your first or last name, your physical or email address and your telephone number.<br />
No Personal Information will be collected on the Site without your consent. Under special circumstances, and always honestly and lawfully, TVA will prompt you to enter Personal Information.  For example, we might collect this information during your registration for one of our personalized services, emails and online contests, or when you indicate you are interested in receiving information about other services, contests or news regarding TVA or its partners. When TVA requests such information, you will be expressly notified in advance that you are providing Personal Information that will be subject to our practices regarding the collection, recording, development, modification, retention and destruction of such Personal Information. You will always have the option to decline our request for Personal Information or terminate a subscription to a personalized service you have previously accepted.<br />
We might also automatically collect general anonymous information regarding your use of the Site, such as the date and time of your visit, the particular pages of the Site you visited, the type of browser you used, the IP address of your device, and the name of your internet service provider. Please see our Navigational Data policy below to learn more about such information.<br />
 <br /><strong>2. </strong><strong>Why do we collect Personal Information?</strong><br />
The collection of this information allows TVA to provide an experience that is more relevant to your needs, to improve the Site’s content and interface, to reach you in the event you win a prize, to ensure that we are complying with our own Site rules for control purposes, and, only if you have so indicated, to communicate with you from time to time.<br />
 <br /><strong>3. </strong><strong>Who may access the Personal Information?</strong><br />
It is important to note that personal Information will not be made available to third persons outside TVA, including to TVA’s advertisers, customers or partners, without your prior written authorization. Notwithstanding the foregoing, TVA may share certain Personal Information: (a) with its affiliates and related companies, unless the information was gathered on a site that you paid to access, in which case we will obtain your express consent prior to sharing the information with our affiliates and related companies; or (b) with a third party retained by TVA to sort and handle data on TVA’s behalf, subject to a contractual obligation to ensure the safety and confidentiality thereof. While TVA requires all third parties to whom Personal Information is disclosed to abide by all applicable privacy laws, some such parties may be based outside of Canada where the applicable laws authorize disclosure of Personal Information to judicial, quasi-judicial and governmental bodies under limited circumstances.<br />
 <br /><strong>4.  </strong><strong>Where and how long do we store Personal Information?</strong><br />
The Personal Information collected by TVA is stored in areas inaccessible to the public and protected by security measures appropriate for the information’s level of sensitivity. In order to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Information, TVA implements administrative, technical and physical protective measures for all the Personal Information under our custody and control. Our security measures aim to protect your Personal Information against loss, theft and unauthorized access, copy, use or modification.<br />
We retain Personal Information only as long as necessary or relevant for the purposes mentioned in the Policy, and always in accordance with the law.<br />
 <br /><strong>5. </strong><strong>Are there limits to TVA’s protection of Personal Information?</strong>  <br />
Despite our good faith protection measures mentioned above, no one can perfectly secure or guarantee the safe transmission of data on this Site, or on the internet in general. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will be perfectly secure from all loss, misuse or modification during its transmission. We must therefore deny liability for any use or misuse of your Personal Information by a third party, for example, if such Personal Information is intercepted during its online transmission or if we are hacked.<br />
The only circumstances under which TVA might voluntarily disclose Personal Information apart from those expressly provided by law are the following: (a) at the request of a legal authority or in good faith if such action is reasonably required to comply with any law or regulation in effect; (b) to intervene in a trial, prevent fraud or protect or defend TVA’s rights, property or users; or (c) in extreme circumstances, to protect the personal safety of TVA users or the public.<br />
 <br /><strong>6. </strong><strong>Can you access or ask us to rectify your Personal Information?</strong><br />
Yes, you can access or ask us to rectify your Personal Information by submitting a detailed request to: <a href="mailto:infoprivee@quebecor.com">infoprivee@quebecor.com</a>.  However, we can only satisfy your request if we already have a personal folder in your name in our files (for example, if you already communicated Personal Information to us when creating an account).<br /><strong>Be vigilant!</strong> Our Site may contain links to websites managed by third parties. These links are offered to you only for your convenience. Clicking on these links leads you to another website.

TVA denies all liability in this regard. We therefore advise you to remain prudent and attentive at all times when you are surfing the internet or creating content on the internet, particularly when making online comments.<br />

TVA reserves the right, at its own discretion, to delete any content uploaded onto this Site. However, this is an option and not an obligation. Therefore, you understand that TVA does not make any representation concerning its control of the content on the Site, particularly given the volume of information available and the speed at which data can be transmitted on the service.

 <br /><strong>6. Safety of Children and Teenagers on the Internet.</strong><br />
An ever growing number of children and teenagers use the internet and they derive many obvious benefits from such use. However, as with any other environment, they can become the targets of crime or exploitation because they are more vulnerable. This is why we recommend that you monitor the use of the internet by your children, teenagers and any other person in your custody or care, and that you offer them common-sense safety tips and recommendations. Such measures often prevent them from being exposed to offensive data and from becoming the victims of harassment or other criminal acts. To reduce the risks of exposure of your children, teenagers and any other person in your custody to such elements, perform reasonable supervision of their use of your internet service. Your children, teenagers and any person in your custody or care should be aware that they must never disclose Personal Information or otherwise identify themselves, particularly in forums or chat rooms, by email, on an electronic bulletin board, on a blog, on a micro-blog or on any page of any website. It is important that they be encouraged to disclose their concerns to you if they receive messages that make them uncomfortable or shock them. These recommendations will help them browse the internet as informed users and will allow you to ensure that these services help to enrich their development.<br />
 <br /><strong>7. Network Security and Efficiency.</strong><br />
TVA does not guarantee the total efficiency or security of the Site. Despite TVA’s security efforts, it is possible that a hacker might succeed in penetrating the server.

Moreover, TVA reserves the right to maintain and update the Site at all times, which may result in the temporary unavailability of the Site or its services.<br />
 <br /><strong>8. External Links.</strong><br />

 <br /><strong>10. Indemnification.</strong><br />
TVA is not liable for the content and actions generated by you or third parties on the Site or in relation to the Site. You accept that you are solely and exclusively responsible for your content and you acknowledge that you have produced it knowingly. TVA is not liable for any breach of the Terms by or with you or a third party.

 <br /><strong>12. Applicable Law and Amendments.</strong><br />

These amendments will come into effect immediately after being published in the Terms.
