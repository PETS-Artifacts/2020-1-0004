<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;"> </p>
<p>In addition to the information that we collect from you directly, we may also receive information about you from other sources, including business partners, Affiliates, or publicly available sources.  For example, if you make a reservation at one of our Licensed Hotels, that hotel transmits information to us as part of our legitimate interest in, among other things, maintaining a global reservation system and providing for customer service and support.<br />
</p>
<p>In addition to the purposes and uses described above, we use information in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>To conduct analytics.<br />
</li>
<li>To identify you when you visit our websites or Licensed Hotels.</li>
<li>To provide service to you and to improve our services and product offerings.</li>
<li>To respond to inquiries related to support, employment opportunities, or other requests. </li>
<li>To send marketing and promotional materials, including information relating to our products, services, sales, or promotions.</li>
<li>To streamline the reservation or checkout process.</li>
<li>For the safety and security of guests, staff, and other visitors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the sections above describe our primary purpose in collecting your information, in many situations we have more than one purpose.  For example, if you make a room reservation we collect your information so that we, or so that a Licensed Hotel, can perform a contract with you, but we also collect your information as we have a legitimate interest in maintaining your information after your transaction is complete so that we can quickly and easily respond to any questions about your stay.  As a result, our collection and processing of your information may be based upon our need to perform a contract, our obligations under law, our legitimate interest in conducting our business, and/or your consent.</p>
<p><a name="Sharing" id="Sharing"></a><strong>Sharing Of Information</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the specific situations discussed elsewhere in this policy, we disclose information in the following situations:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">1.     <strong>Licensed Hotels and Affiliates</strong>. We share your information with the Licensed Hotels that will be fulfilling a reservation.  We also share your information with Affiliates in the geographic area of a Licensed Hotel in which you have stayed or you intend to stay.  Depending upon the context, Licensed Hotels and Affiliates use your information for a variety of purposes, including preparing for your stay, providing you with accommodations, marketing, or redeeming rewards points.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     <strong>BWR Partners</strong>.  We share information with independent companies that we have partnered with or that are participants in our BWR program to allow you to earn and redeem rewards, points, or credits in connection with your BWR membership and in accordance with your chosen earning and spending preferences.  For example, you may decide to select a particular airline partner through which you can earn BWR points.  We also share information with independent companies if you have selected that you would like to receive promotions and marketing material from Best Western’s third party-business partners.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     <strong>Partner Marketing and Promotions</strong>. We share information with independent companies if you have selected that you would like to receive promotions or marketing material from Best Western’s third party-business partners.  We also offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners.  If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party partner, the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them.  Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     <strong>Travel Agents and Online Travel Websites</strong>.  We share your information with travel agents, and/or online travel websites that you use in order to process your reservation request and to comply with any requirements or needs of those entities.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     <strong>Service Providers</strong>. We share your information with service providers.  Among other things, service providers help us to administer our databases, websites, marketing, communications, and surveys; service providers provide us with technical and logistical support; service providers process payments on our behalf; and service providers assist in the fulfillment of reservations and orders.  If a service provider receives information from us about an EU data subject or a Swiss data subject and takes an action that is contrary to the principles of the EU-US Privacy Shield or the Swiss-US Privacy Shield, we shall be liable for those actions unless we prove that we are not responsible for causing them.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     <strong>Public</strong>.  Some of our websites may provide the opportunity to post comments or reviews in a public forum.  If you decide to submit information on these pages, that information may be publically available.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     <strong>Other Disclosures without Your Consent</strong>. We may disclose information in response to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or in connection with any legal process, or to comply with relevant laws or for national security requirements within the United States or the other jurisdictions in which we operate.  We may also share your information in order to establish or exercise our rights, to defend against a legal claim, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding possible illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, or a violation of our policies, or to comply with your request for the shipment of products to or the provision of services by a third party intermediary. We also may share information with our corporate affiliates (<em>e.g</em>., subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common ownership or control).  In addition, if another company acquires or plans to acquire our company, business, or our assets, we will also share information with that company, including at the negotiation stage. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     <strong>Other Disclosures with Your Consent.</strong>  We may ask if you would like us to share your information with other unaffiliated third parties who are not described elsewhere in this policy.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">2.     <strong>Promotional Mailings.</strong>  If at any time you do not want to receive offers and/or circulars from us you can remove yourself from our mailing lists by emailing us (our contact information is below) with &quot;NO SNAIL MAIL&quot; in the subject line along with your name, address and zip code. Please note that our mailings are prepared in advance of their being sent. Although we will remove your name from our mailing list after receiving your request, you may still receive mailings from us that had been initiated prior to your name being removed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">3.     <strong>Promotional Text Messages.<em>  </em></strong>If you receive a text message from us that contains promotional information you can opt-out of receiving future text messages by replying “STOP.”</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">4.     <strong>Access to Your Personal Information</strong>. You can request access to your personal information by completing and submitting a <u><a href="/en_US/legal/privacy-form.html">Request Form</a></u>. If required by law, upon request, we will grant you reasonable access to the personal information that we have about you. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">5.     <strong>Changes to Your Personal Information</strong>. We rely on you to update and correct your personal information.  Most of our websites allow you to modify or delete your account profile.  Note that we may keep historical information in our backup files as permitted by law.  If our website does not permit you to update or correct certain information you can request that your information be changed by completing and submitting a <u><a href="/en_US/legal/privacy-form.html">Request Form</a></u>.  Although BWI will attempt in good faith to respond to your request, we may not be able to change your information in all circumstances.  For example we may not be able to change your information if doing so would impose an undue burden or expense, or if it would require us to change information relating to another person.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">6.     <strong>Deletion of Your Personal Information</strong>. You can request information about how long we keep a specific type of information by contacting us at the address described below.  You can request that your information be deleted by completing and submitting a <u><a href="/en_US/legal/privacy-form.html">Request Form</a></u>. If required by law we will delete your personal information after such a request is made.  You should note that there are some situations in which we may decline to delete your information.  For example, we may keep your personal information as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">7.     <strong>Revoking Consent or Objecting to Processing</strong>.  You can revoke consent to processing (where such processing is based upon consent) or object to our processing by completing and submitting a <u><a href="/en_US/legal/privacy-form.html">Request Form</a></u>.  If you revoke consent or object to further processing we may no longer be able to provide you services.  In some cases, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so, or if we are unable to adequately verify your identity.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40.0px;">8.     <strong>Online Tracking.  </strong>We do not currently recognize automated browser signals regarding tracking mechanisms, which may include &quot;Do Not Track&quot; instructions.</p>

<p><a name="Protect" id="Protect"></a><strong>How We Protect Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>No method of transmission over the Internet or of electronic storage is fully secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information. In the event that we are required by law to inform you of any breach to your personal information we may notify you electronically, in writing, or by telephone, if permitted to do so by law.</p>
<p>Some of our websites permit you to create an account.  When you do you will be prompted to create a password.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password, and you are responsible for any access to or use of your account by someone else that has obtained your password, whether or not such access or use has been authorized by you.  You should notify us of any unauthorized use of your password or account.</p>
<p><a name="Retain" id="Retain"></a><strong>How Long We Retain Information</strong></p>
<p>We retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.  For example, we retain BWR information for as long as an individual remains a BWR member because BWR points do not expire and the information is needed in order to allow the individual to redeem their rewards.  We retain information in our reservation system, in full or in summary form, for three years following a guest’s departure in order to process your reservation, provide post-reservation customer support, and provide invoicing and recordkeeping.  We typically retain information in our customer care complaint system for three years after receipt, unless the information is needed for an ongoing purpose such as to address an open issue. </p>
<p><a name="Countries" id="Countries"></a><strong>Countries Used For Processing</strong></p>
<p>BWI operates from the United States in accordance with the laws of the United States.  Individuals that provide information to BWI or visit BWI’s website should be aware that the laws of the United States may differ from those of your country of residence.  For example, there may be situations in which we are required to share your information with United States law enforcement personnel.  The following provides additional information for data received by BWI from other countries or transmitted by BWI to other countries:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transmission of Information from the European Union.  </strong>BWI complies with the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield and the U.S.-Swiss Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. BWI has submitted its self-certification that it adheres to the Privacy Shield principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. If there is any conflict between this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principals shall apply. Once your information is received in the United States, if BWI transmits it to a processor outside of the EEA, BWI will take steps to ensure that the processor complies with the substantive principles of the GDPR and/or Privacy Shield.  If you would like more information concerning the protections applied for a particular onward transfer you can contact us using the information below.  To learn more about the Privacy Shield program and to view BWI's certification please visit <a href="http://www.privacyshield.gov/">http://www.privacyshield.gov</a>.  Please note that a violation of BWI’s commitment to Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. If you feel that BWI has mishandled your Personal Information in violation of the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles, please contact BWI using the contact information below with a written description of your complaint. After receiving such written description, a representative from BWI's Customer Care Department will contact you to set up a time and manner to discuss your complaint. BWI is dedicated to addressing all legitimate complaints about its adherence to this Policy and the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles and will make a good faith effort to engage in communications to address such complaints. For unresolved complaints under the Privacy Shield Privacy Principles, BWI has agreed to participate in the JAMS EU Privacy Shield Program, an independent dispute resolution program established in the EU which is free of charge to you. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by BWI, please visit the JAMS Program Website at <a title="Privacy Shield or Safe Harbor Claim" alt="Privacy Shield or Safe Harbor Claim" href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield">https://jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim</a> for more information and/or to file a complaint.  If your complaint is not resolved by BWI, or through the JAMS process, under limited circumstances a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel, or you may have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection agency.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Transmission of Information to Other Countries</strong>. In addition to having your information transferred to the United States where BWI is located, if you are making a reservation at a Licensed Hotel in a foreign country your information will be sent to that hotel, as well as to any Affiliate associated with that hotel.  In addition, we may send your information to a vendor or partner in a foreign country for purposes of administering our BWR program and marketing efforts.</li>
