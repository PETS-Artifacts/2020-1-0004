<p>IMAX Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “IMAX” or “we”) value your time, respect your privacy, and seek to earn your trust. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (the “Website”).</p>
<p>We collect information about you through the Website in an effort to improve your IMAX experience and to tell you about our products, services, contests and promotions. Your trust is essential to us, and we are not in the business of selling or renting information about our customers to others.</p>
<p>In line with these values, our privacy policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will post an updated policy on the Website and change the “last updated” line above. For this reason, we ask that you check periodically to review our policy for such changes.</p>
<p>If you have any unanswered questions about our privacy policy, click this <a href="mailto:info@imax.com">info@imax.com</a> to reach our Privacy Officer.</p>
<h3>What kind of personal information does IMAX collect?</h3>
<p>We may collect personal information from you, such as your name, e-mail address, postal address, phone number, gender, birthday, and personal interests, when you visit the Website, save your information with us online, contact us with a question or concern, participate in a contest, promotion, or survey, or communicate with us in any other way.</p>
<p>We may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address to help identify you, gather broad demographic information about users of the Website, diagnose problems with our systems, and administer the Website.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that any information you provide to us is your true and correct information.</p>
<h3>How does IMAX collect this information?</h3>
<p>We receive and store any information from your visits to the Website or that you give us in any other way.</p>
<p>As is true of most web sites, we gather and store certain information automatically, including IP addresses, browser types, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. This information does not identify individual users, and is used to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.</p>
<p>To do this, we use ‘cookies’ or alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features that improve the performance of the Website for you. If you are concerned about cookies, the “help”, “options” or “preferences” functions on most browsers will allow you to limit or disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of our interactive features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
<p>To ensure we are sending our e-mails to the right address, we may receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from us if your computer supports such capabilities.</p>
<p>Last, to provide customer service, we might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive address information from these sources to correct our records and contact you more easily.</p>
<p>We will correct any personal information we store whenever possible and delete stale information on an ongoing basis and are very happy to hear from you to ensure that our information is as complete and accurate as possible.</p>
<h3>How does IMAX use your personal information?</h3>
<p>By submitting personal information and registering on the Website, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be used by IMAX for internal marketing analyses and to provide you with information from time to time about IMAX and IMAX promotions. The customer's contact information may also be used to contact the visitor when necessary and will not be shared with other affiliated companies. Demographic and profile data (such as postal code and age) may be collected at the Website.</p>
<p>We run contests on the Website in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address), and demographic information (like their postal code or age). We may use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary and will not be shared with other companies or affiliated companies. Only IMAX has access to your personal information.</p>
<p>The information we learn from you helps us personalize and improve your experience on the Website. Only IMAX has access to your personal information.</p>
<p>In particular, by using the Website, you acknowledge and agree that we may use your personal information in the following ways:</p>
<ul><li>To communicate with you, to send you information about our products, services, contests, and promotions;</li>
