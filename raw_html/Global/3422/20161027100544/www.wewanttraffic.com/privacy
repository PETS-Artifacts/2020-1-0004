<h2>Cookies Policy -Information Traffic collects from you</h2>
<h3>A. What is a cookie?</h3>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier  that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a  "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your  device's hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if  your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser  only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not  the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user  visits their website in order to track online Traffic Group. Ltd flows.</p>
<span class="mobile-more-txt">
<p>Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor  the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices  to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive  cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services  cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to  take full advantage of all of the Traffic Group. Ltd website features.</p>
<p>Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser  to learn how to change your cookie preferences.
</p>
<p>During the course of any visit to the Traffic Group. Ltd website, the pages you  see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this,  because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out  whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This  is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left  there on the last visit.</p>

<p>Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our  visitors and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example:  if on a previous visit you went to our services pages, we might find this out  from your cookie and highlight certain service information on your second and  subsequent visits.</p>
<span class="mobile-more-txt">
<p>Traffic Group. Ltd also operates measurement and research trials. We gather  information regarding the visitors to Traffic Group. Ltd sites on our behalf  using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. Traffic Group. Ltd uses this type of information to help improve the services we  provide to our users. Traffic Group. Ltd strictly require that third parties do  not use any information for their own business or other purposes. Certain other  areas of the Traffic Group. Ltd site may use cookies for a specific reason -  for example, to help an online element work effectively on your device. If this  is the case, the local terms for that area of the website will make this clear  and you should refer to those local terms for additional information.</p>
