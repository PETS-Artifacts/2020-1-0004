<p><br /><strong>Marketing</strong></p>
<p>We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. We have established a privacy centre where you can view and make certain decisions about your personal data. You can access the centre via a link on every email that we send you or by logging in to <a href="http://www.wolves.co.uk" target="_blank" title="www.wolves.co.uk">www.wolves.co.uk</a></p>
<p><strong>Promotional offers from us</strong></p>
<p>We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing).</p>
<p>You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased goods or services from us or if you provided us with your details when you entered a competition or registered for a promotion and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.</p>
<p><strong>Third-party marketing</strong></p>
<p>We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any company outside the Wolves group of companies for marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Opting out</strong></p>
<p>You can ask us or third parties to stop sending you marketing messages at any time by logging into the website and checking or unchecking relevant boxes to adjust your marketing preferences or by following the opt-out links on any marketing message sent to you or by contacting the DPO at any time.</p>
<p>Where you opt out of receiving these marketing messages, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of a product/service purchase, warranty registration, product/service experience or other transactions.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see <a href="#cookies_policy">here</a></p>
<p><strong>Change of purpose</strong></p>
<p>We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact the DPO.</p>
<p>If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.<a id="disclosures_of_your_personal_data"></a></p>
<p>Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>5. Disclosures of your personal data</strong></p>

If a change happens to our business, then the new owners may use your personal data in the same way as set out in this privacy notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law.<a id="international_transfers"></a> We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal data for their own purposes and only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.<a id="data_security"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>6. International transfers</strong></p>
<p>We do not transfer your personal data outside the European Economic Area (<strong>EEA</strong>).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>7. Data security</strong></p>
<p>We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.</p>
<p>We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.</p>
<p>All integrations via SFTP file transfer or API direct from partner systems are fully encrypted and secure.<a id="data_retention"></a> If we need to do ad-hoc data transfers, we use a secure cloud folder for storing and transferring files and data</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>8. Data retention</strong></p>
<p><strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong></p>
<p>We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
<p>To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
<p>Details of retention periods for different aspects of your personal data are available in our retention policy which you can request from us by contacting the DPO.</p>
<p>By law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they cease being customers for tax purposes.</p>
<p>In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see <a href="#request_erasure">below</a> for further information.</p>
<p>In some circumstances we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you)<a id="your_legal_rights"></a> for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>9. Your legal rights</strong></p>

We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the ICO so please contact us in the first instance. If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact the DPO on email at <a href="mailto:DPO@wolves.co.uk" target="_blank" title="DPO@wolves.co.uk">DPO@wolves.co.uk</a>, by telephone on 0871 222 2220 or by post at DPO, Wolverhampton Wanderers Football Club, 67 Waterloo Rd, Wolverhampton WV1 4QR</p>
<p><strong>No fee usually required</strong></p>
<p>You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>What we may need from you</strong></p>
<p>We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.</p>
<p><strong>Time limit to respond</strong></p>
<p>We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.<a id="glossary"></a> Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>10. Glossary</strong></p>
<p><strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting the DPO.</p>
<p><strong>Performance of Contract</strong> means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>
<p><strong>Comply with a legal or regulatory obligation</strong><a id="third_parties"></a> means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation that we are subject to.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p><strong>External Third Parties</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Service providers acting as processors who provide IT and system administration services.</li>
<li>Professional advisers acting as processors or joint controllers including lawyers, bankers, auditors and insurers who provide consultancy, banking, legal, insurance and accounting services.</li>
<li>HM Revenue &amp; Customs, regulators and other authorities acting as processors or joint controllers who require reporting of processing activities in certain circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong></p>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<p><strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>
<p><strong>Request correction</strong> of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>
<p><strong>Request erasure</strong><a id="request_erasure"></a> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>
<p><strong>Object to processing</strong> of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>
<p><strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Request the transfer</strong> of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong> where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.<a id="cookies_policy"></a> If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>11. Cookies Policy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Site tracking &amp; cookies</strong></p>
<p>When visiting our website, we would like to use "cookies" and other tracking technologies which record information and data automatically.</p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>"Cookies" are small text files stored on your "browser" on your computer's hard drive, which collect basic information, but not personally identifying information, that a website can use to recognize repeat site visits. Cookies send information stored on them back to our webserver when you access our website.</p>
<p>Cookies enable Wolves to provide features such as remembering your address, so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you use the website. Cookies do not attach to your system or damage your files.</p>
<p><strong>Removing cookies</strong></p>
<p>Cookies can be deleted from your hard drive if you wish. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. You can usually change your browser so that it will not accept cookies. If you do this, you will still be able to browse around the site and use most of the features on the website but the functions that allow you to add items to your trolley, set up a new account or access an existing account will not be available. Alternatively, you can adjust your browser to tell you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. How you adjust your browser to stop it accepting cookies or to notify you of them will depend on the type of internet browser programme, which your computer uses.</p>
<p>If your computer uses Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, you will need to follow these instructions at this link <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" title="www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> (Wolves is not responsible for the content of external websites.)</p>
<p>Go to the heading "Manage Cookies". Click onto the option you prefer, either stopping cookies being installed or notifying you of them. From the list provided, click onto the programme, which your computer uses. If this is not shown on the list, click on the "help" heading on the bar at the top of this page, search for information on "cookies" - an explanation of how to delete cookies will appear, then follow those instructions.</p>
<p>If we cannot use such technology it is possible that certain functionality or 'personalised' services of this site might be affected and you might not be able to access certain Webpages. This information does not identify you personally.</p>
<p><strong>What information do we collect?</strong></p>
<p>We automatically collect and store only the following information about your visit:-</p>
<ul>
<li>the internet domain and IP address from where you access our Website;</li>
<li>the type of browser software and operating system used to access our Website;</li>
<li>the date and time you access our Website;</li>
<li>the pages you enter, visit and exit our Website from; and</li>
<li>if you linked to our Website from another Website, the address of that Website.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why do we collect this information?</p>
<p>We use this information to help us identify click stream patterns, to compile aggregate data in order to observe behaviour and to improve our Website, to learn about the number of visitors to our Website, the types of technology our visitors use, to target the advertising and to assess the general effectiveness of such advertising.</p>
<p>We only use this information to ensure that our Webpages stay compatible with a selection of browsers and systems and thereby ensure that the pages appeal to a wide audience.</p>
<p>Currently our Webpages are optimised for the following Internet browsers: Internet Explorer 8.0+, Firefox, Safari, Chrome and native browsers on mobile devices and tablets.</p>
<p>We do not use cookies to collect or store personal information such as your name or email address.</p>
<p><strong>Third party advertising cookies</strong></p>
<p>Some of the advertisements you see on this site are generated by third parties. Some of these third parties generate their own "anonymous cookies", for the same reasons we do: to track how many unique users have seen a particular ad, and how many times they have seen it.</p>
<p>These third party cookies cannot be used to identify an individual user, but only for statistical purposes, for example, in providing you with advertisements that are more relevant to your interests. Additionally, the companies that generate these cookies have their own, very strict, privacy policies but we don't have access to these cookies; other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all (although we may use statistical information arising from these third party cookies and provided to us by third parties, to improve the targeting of advertisements to users).</p>
