        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Your privacy is important to us.  We understand that you are aware of and care about your privacy rights, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy describes Merriam-Webster’s policies and practices regarding its collection and use of your personal data through our free, ad-supported websites, mobile application services and any software provided on or in connection with Merriam-Webster services (Services), and sets forth your privacy rights.</p>

        <p>Your decision to use the Services and provide your personal data is voluntary. We indicate on our online, mobile, and other registration forms what types of personal data are requested. You may choose not to submit requested information online, or may choose to restrict the use of cookies (see our <a href="/cookie-policy">Cookie Policy</a> and <a href="#toc5">Your Rights & Choices</a> below for more information), but that may limit the services Merriam-Webster is able to provide to you.</p>

        <p>The Services are a network of general audience sites, and are not targeted to, and do not knowingly collect personal data from, minors under 16 years of age. We request that these individuals do not provide personal data through the Services.</p>

        <p>We recognize that information privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy policies.</p>

                <h4>Purposes for processing (using) personal data provided directly by you</h4>
                <p>As explained above, Merriam-Webster processes your data to provide you with the products and services you have requested or purchased from us, including special features, subscriptions, e-newsletters, Word of the Day, and other content.  Sometimes we use third-party providers to facilitate the delivery of the services described above, and these third-party providers may be supplied with or have access to your personal information for the sole purpose of providing services to you on our behalf, such as Word of the Day.  Also, we may disclose your personal information in special legal circumstances. For instance, such information may be used where it is necessary to protect our copyright or intellectual property rights, or if the law requires us to do so.</p>

                <p>To carry out these activities, Merriam-Webster may rely on many legal bases to process your personal data, including where:</p>
                <ul class="bullet_indent_list">
                    <li>necessary to perform the contractual obligations in our Terms of Service and to provide the requested Services to you;</li>
                    <li>necessary for a third party’s, or our, legitimate interests;</li>
                    <li>necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to defend legal claims;</li>
                    <li>necessary to protect the public interest or vital interest of others;</li>
                    <li>you have expressly made information public; or</li>
                    <li>you have consented to the processing, which may be revoked at any time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>We also use your data for legitimate business purposes that enable us to refine our products and services to better tailor them to your needs, communicate with you about other products and services offered by Merriam-Webster, secure your personal data, or comply with regulatory and legal obligations.</p>

                <p>You can update your personal information and change your marketing preferences at any time by sending an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@m-w.com">privacy@m-w.com</a>.</p>

                <h4>Payment card information</h4>
                <p>You may choose to purchase goods or services from Merriam-Webster using a payment card. Typically, payment card information is provided directly by users, via the Services, into the PCI/DSS-compliant payment processing service to which the Merriam-Webster subscribes, and Merriam-Webster does not, itself, process or store your card information. We strongly encourage you not to submit this information by email. When Merriam-Webster employees receive payment card information from users by email, fax, phone, or mail, it is entered as instructed and then deleted or destroyed.</p>

        <h2>How we respond to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; signals</h2>
        <p>When you visit a website in any browser, you automatically share information with that website, such as your IP address, and other standard PC information. If the website contains content provided by a third-party website (for example a web measurement tools such as a web beacon or scripts), some information about you may be automatically sent to the content provider.  This type of arrangement has several benefits, such as allowing you to access third-party content from our Services conveniently. Some internet browsers or other tools include &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (DNT) features that, when turned on, send a signal to websites you visit indicating you do not wish to be tracked across websites over time. However, since no technology standard for DNT signals has been developed or adopted to date, Merriam-Webster does not currently respond to DNT signals.</p>

        <p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to prevent sharing of your personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes through a cost-free means. We will only knowingly share your personal information with third parties for third-party direct marketing purposes if you have consented to that sharing (opt-in) or are given an opportunity to terminate that sharing (opt-out) prospectively. California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits California residents who have supplied personal information, as defined in the statute, to us, under certain circumstances, to exercise such opt-in /opt-out rights and inquire further about how to do so and how we comply with Section 1798.83.  For us to determine if this applies to you and to make such a request, please:</p>

        <ul class="bullet_indent_list">
            <li>make your request in writing to <a href="mailto:dpo@m-w.com">dpo@m-w.com</a> with &ldquo;California Privacy Rights Request&rdquo; in the subject line;</li>
