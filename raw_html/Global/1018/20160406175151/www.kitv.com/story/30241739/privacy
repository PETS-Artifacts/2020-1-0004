For example, if you subscribe to online services we offer or register for certain services with us online that require registration, agree to participate in on-line surveys, participate in on-line contests, sweepstakes and promotions sponsored by us and others, make certain on-line information requests to us, participate in various activities on the Site, or want to establish a profile for submission of user-generated content available to other Site visitors and/or the general public, we may ask you to provide &ldquo;personally identifiable information,&rdquo; such as your contact information (e.g., name, phone number, address and e-mail address) and user demographic information (e.g., gender, age, hobbies or interests). Because participation in these activities is completely voluntary, you choose whether to disclose this information.<br /><br /><em>Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</em>&nbsp;The non-personally identifiable information we collect may include the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, and the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet.

Also, as further detailed in the section titled &ldquo;What about cookies and tracking pixels?&rdquo; below, non-personally identifiable information is shared with advertisers and advertising services that provide us and advertisers with demographic information about our visitors.<br /><br /><em>Sharing with Service Providers:</em>&nbsp;Except explained below with respect to IB, we may share your personally identifiable information with our business partners and/or other third party service providers, such as Web site or database hosting companies, address list hosting companies, e-mail service providers, analytics companies, distribution companies, fulfillment companies, payment processing companies and other similar vendors and services providers, which perform services for us and which use such information on our behalf (collectively &quot;Service Providers&quot;).<br /><br /><em>Internet Broadcasting Systems Inc.:</em>&nbsp;One of our Service Providers, Internet Broadcasting Systems Inc.

In addition to collecting and using user information to perform its services, IB may collect and use your information for its own purposes (including direct marketing purposes), subject to its own privacy policies. If you do not want IB to collect and use your information for its own purposes (including personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information), you will no longer be able to use the Site and you must deactivate your Site account and remove your information from the Site.<br /><br /><em>Sharing with Third-Party Marketers:</em>&nbsp;We may share your personally identifiable information with, and make our customer lists available to, third parties (outside of KITV, Inc.), who may choose to contact you to promote their own goods and services, or who may use such information for other purposes, including direct marketing. Additionally, when you enter a contest or sweepstakes that is sponsored by a third party, independently or jointly with us, your personally identifiable information may be shared with that third party for their use, in their discretion and in accordance with their privacy policies, including for their direct marketing purposes. While some of our contests and sweepstakes will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personally identifiable information to be shared with the third-party sponsor, other contests will not give you that option. Thus, in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest. We are not responsible for how our co-sponsors or such other third parties may use your information.&nbsp;<strong>If you want us to stop sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing use, follow the directions in the &quot;<a href="http://www.kitv.com/story/30241745/terms-of-use#Q4">What are my opt-out rights?</a>&quot; section below.</strong><br /><br /><em>Legally-Compelled Disclosures:</em>&nbsp;To the extent permitted or required by law, any information collected on or through the Site or concerning its use (including personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable information) may be disclosed to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or other process that requires disclosure of information. We may also use or disclose your information to enforce compliance with our<a href="http://www.kitv.com/connect/terms">Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;and as permitted by law to collect debts, fight fraud or protect the rights or property of the Site, our customers, our users, or third parties, or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.<br /><br /><em>Information Posted to Public Forums:</em>&nbsp;This Site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and/or other similar features available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personally identifiable information about you or anyone else. The Site cannot and does not accept any responsibility for ensuring the privacy of any information that you choose to disclose in these areas. Any content or information you provide to these areas of the Site is done at your own risk.<br /><br /><a name="Q4"></a><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong><br /><br /><em>Opting Out of the Site's Marketing Communications:</em>&nbsp;While many of our visitors appreciate the benefits that online registration allows us to provide them, we respect your individual right to control how your personally identifiable information may be used. If you do not wish to receive promotional communications from the Site regarding special offers and product updates and other news and information, you can uncheck the box that allows us to use your information for this purpose when your information is collected (if applicable), or go to your personal profile or account on the Site and edit your email preferences (if applicable). You also will notice that there is an unsubscribe link at the bottom of each of our promotional e-mail messages, which will enable you to opt out of receiving all future promotional emails from the Site. Simply click on that link to go to a page that allows you to unsubscribe from any or all of the lists to which you are subscribed. Please understand that if you opt out of receiving promotional correspondence from the Site, we may still contact you in connection with your relationship, activities, transactions and communications with us, and you may not opt out of these types of messages.<br /><br /><em>Opting Out of Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Third Parties for Marketing Use:</em>&nbsp;If you want us to stop sharing your personally identifiable information with third parties (outside of KITV, Inc.) for their direct marketing use, go to your personal profile or account on the Site and edit your preferences (if applicable). If you do request to have us stop sharing your personally information with such third parties for their direct marketing purposes, such request will only apply as of the date of your request, and we will not be responsible for any communications that you may receive from entities that received your personally identifiable information prior to such request. In these cases, please contact that entity directly.<br /><br /><em><strong>California &amp; Canadian Users: Your California Privacy Rights.</strong></em>&nbsp;California's &quot;Shine the Light&quot; law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the customer has exercised an option to opt-out of such information sharing. We have such a policy in place. The heading&nbsp;<strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong>&nbsp;below explains our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared with third parties for the third parties&rsquo; direct or indirect marketing purposes, in accordance with such laws. In addition to reviewing&nbsp;<strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong>, if you wish to find out about any rights you may have under California Civil Code section 1798.83, you may notify us in writing at KITV Inc., C/O Wade O&rsquo;Hagan, 801 South King St. , Honolulu, HI 96813 or contacting us at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kitv.com/" target="_blank">kitv.com</a>. Canadian residents also have certain rights to know how their information may be shared with third parties who engage in direct marketing activities. Again, the section&nbsp;<strong>Third-Party Advertisers</strong>&nbsp;explain our practices and how you can opt-out of having your information shared for such purposes, in accordance with such laws. For the avoidance of doubt, these opt-out options are available for all users and are not limited to Californian and Canadian users.&nbsp;<br /><br /><a name="Q5"></a><strong>What about messages sent to me at my wireless email address or short message service?</strong><br /><br /><em>Wireless Addresses</em><br /><br />If the email address you provide to us is a wireless email address, you agree to receive messages at such address from us (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by either un-checking the box that allows us to use your information for this purpose when your information is collected (if applicable), or by going to your personal profile or account on the Site and editing your email preferences (if applicable)). You understand that your wireless carrier may charge you for these messages. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.<br /><br /><em>Short Message Service and Wireless Internet</em><br /><br />We may make available services through which you can receive messages on your phone or wireless device via short message service (&quot;SMS Service&quot;) or via wireless Internet (&quot;WAP Services&quot;). If you subscribe to one of our SMS or WAP Services, you thereby agree to receive SMS or WAP Service at the address you provide for such purposes. Such messages may come from KITV, Inc., or from third parties who we believe may have goods or services of interest to you (unless you have elected not to receive such messages).<br /><br />You understand that your wireless carrier may charge you for these messages and for access to these services, and that you may opt-out of receiving such messages by editing your preferences in your account profile (if applicable), or by texting the applicable &quot;STOP&quot; message to the short code associated with the particular program/service. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device you use to sign up for the SMS or WAP Service, and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges. To use the SMS or WAP Service, you must reside in the United States. You must register and provide all required personally identifiable information, which may include, for example, your name, SMS or WAP address, wireless carrier and, if fees are applicable to the SMS or WAP Service to which you may subscribe, your billing information (either your credit card information or mobile service carrier information if applicable fees will be billed through your carrier). We may also obtain the date, time and content of your messages in the course of your use of the SMS or WAP Service. We will use the information we obtain in connection with our SMS or WAP Service in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If fees are charged to your wireless account invoice, we may provide your carrier with your applicable information in connection therewith. Your wireless carrier and other service providers may also collect data about your wireless device usage, and their practices are governed by their own policies.<br /><br />You acknowledge and agree that the SMS or WAP Services are provided via wireless systems which use radios (and other means) to transmit communications over complex networks.

You are fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the SMS or WAP Service. We may also access the content of your account and wireless account with your carrier for the purpose of identifying and resolving technical problems and service-related complaints.<br /><br />By signing up for the SMS or WAP Service, you consent to receiving, from time to time, further messages which may include news, promotions and offers from us, unless and until you have opted-out of these activities by editing your preferences in your account profile (if applicable), or by texting the applicable &quot;STOP&quot; message to the short code associated with the particular program/service. Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.<br /><br /><a name="Q6"></a><strong>What about cookies and tracking pixels?</strong><br /><br />We use technologies such as cookies and tracking pixels to collect information from and/or about you, and we do so, for example, to enhance the information we have about your preferences, to store some of your Site settings and to learn about your visits. A cookie is a piece of information that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie allows us to determine that a visit has occurred within the Site, as well as which pages were viewed. You can decide if and how your computer will accept cookies by configuring your preferences option within your Web browser. If you choose to decline cookies, however, some of the functionality of the Site may be impaired.<br /><br />We also may use &quot;tracking pixels&quot; (aka &quot;clear GIFs&quot; or &quot;pixel tags&quot;) or similar technologies in the Site and/or in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A Web beacon is typically a one-pixel, transparent image located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message. These electronic images help us measure the effectiveness of our online advertising and/or e-mail or other messaging campaigns by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit the Site or the number of individuals who open or act upon an e-mail or other type of message.<br /><br />Any or all of the above-described activities with respect to cookies and tracking pixels may be performed on our behalf by our Services Providers (defined above).<br /><br /><a name="Q7"></a><em>Third-Party Advertisers</em><br /><br />We may allow third parties to compile information or aggregate statistics from our use of tracking pixels, cookies and other tracking technologies to help them assess the effectiveness of online marketing and to enable us and our advertisers to deliver more targeted advertising opportunities. This enables users to see advertising more likely to be of interest to them, and advertisers to send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads.<br /><br />If advertisements appear on the Site, they may be provided by third parties who will be helping to manage them for us. Those third parties may employ cookies and tracking pixels (and other tracking technologies) to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement, and to measure advertising effectiveness. We do not control these companies' use of cookies and tracking pixels. Some of these companies (like the ad networks) are members of the industry group, the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers a single location to opt out of their cookies. For more information, we encourage you to visit the Network Advertising Initiative's consumer Web site, at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/" target="_blank">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/</a><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/about-nai/about-nai">.</a><br /><br /><a name="Q8"></a><strong>What information is collected from children under the age of 13?</strong><br /><br />This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13.
