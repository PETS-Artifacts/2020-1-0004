		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="tinyText"><em>Last updated: May 25, 2018</em></p>

		<p>SmartDraw Software, LLC (the "Company") has updated this Privacy Policy (the "Privacy Policy") to reflect changes in data protection law. It applies to the Company's
		online and desktop diagramming applications SmartDraw and SmartDraw for Windows Desktop (collectively, "SmartDraw"), the Company's website
		<a href="https://www.smartdraw.com.com">www.smartdraw.com</a>, and to other interactions
		(e.g., customer service inquiries, user conferences, etc.) you may have with the Company
		(all of which in this Privacy Policy will collectively be referred to as the "Services").</p> 
		
		<img alt="SmartDraw services" src="https://wcs.smartdraw.com/about/images/services.png?bn=1510011143" />
		<br/><br/>
		<p>If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, do not access or use any of the Services or any other aspect of the Company's business.
		Separate agreements govern delivery, access and use of SmartDraw including the SmartDraw Terms of Service (the "Terms of Service")
		and SmartDraw for Windows Desktop License Agreement (the "Windows License").</p>   
		
		<img alt="Governing documents" border="0" src="https://wcs.smartdraw.com/about/images/governing-documents.png?bn=1510011143" />
		<br/><br/>
		<p>This Privacy Policy does not apply to Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft One Drive, Box or any third-party document storage service
		that integrates with SmartDraw.  Further, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party apps, add-ons and extensions you
		may choose to use with SmartDraw such as Atlassian's Confluence, Jira and Trello apps.</p> 
		
		<p>The person or organization that purchased and entered into the Terms of Service and/or Windows License
		(the "Customer") controls access, rights and privileges for SmartDraw along with the disposition of all
		associated information, files or other content created and entered into SmartDraw (the "Customer Information").
		In some cases, the Customer may not be the individual actually using the Services.
		If you were granted access or otherwise authorized to use a license to SmartDraw not purchased and owned
		by you (e.g., by your employer or another entity or person) then you are not a Customer, but are an End User ("End User") of SmartDraw.</p> 
		
		<p>The term "you" as used in this Privacy Policy includes the Customer and each End User as applicable.
		The Company is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as "we" or "us."</p>
		
		<img alt="Roles" src="https://wcs.smartdraw.com/about/images/roles.png?bn=1510011143" />
		<br/><br/>
		<p>End Users of SmartDraw should direct their data privacy questions to the Customer as the
		End User's use of SmartDraw is subject to that Customer's privacy policies. The Company is not
		responsible for the privacy or security practices of a particular Customer which may differ
		from this Privacy Policy. If you as an End User have any questions about privacy practices,
		please contact the Customer whose license of SmartDraw you use. You may also contact the
		Company at <a href="mailto:support@smartdraw.com?Subject=SmartDraw%27s%20Privacy%20Policy">support@smartdraw.com</a>
		or by phone at 1-800-768-3729 or 1-858-225-3300 and the
		Company will help you identify a contact for the Customer to whom to direct your privacy concerns.</p>

		<h3>What Information the Company Collects About You</h3>
		
		<p>The Company collects information about you when you provide it to us,
		when you use the Services, and when other sources provide it to us, as further described below.</p>
		
		<h4>Information You Provide To Us Directly</h4>
		
		<p>We collect the Customer's email address when it registers for a trial license and/or purchases a
		license for SmartDraw.  At the time a license to SmartDraw is purchased, we may also collect
		the Customer's name, job title, phone number, fax number, your billing and shipping address,
		a VAT or GST tax exemption ID number (if applicable) and payment card information it provides.
		We will also collect the details about the license purchased such as the type and term of license,
		number of End Users, etc., along with any comments made in conjunction with your order. Similar
		information may be collected from each End User as they are authorized to use SmartDraw by the Customer.</p>
		
		<p>We may also collect summary information from phone and email interactions you may have with
		our support and sales representatives, including additional information you may have
		provided during those interactions. In the online edition of SmartDraw, we also
		keep track of any preferences you set.</p>
		
		<p>From time-to-time we may also collect information via surveys. Participation in these
		surveys is completely voluntary and you may choose whether or not to participate and
		disclose any information about you. Information requested on such surveys may include
		contact information (such as name and address), and demographic information
		(such education level, and job function). Survey information will be used only for
		purposes of improving the use and customer satisfaction of the Company's products and website.
		As a condition to participating in a survey, you will be asked to consent to our
		collection and use of survey information you provide.</p>
		
		<h4>Information You Provide To Us Indirectly</h4>
		
		<p>If you use our website we collect the same basic information that most websites
		collect. We use common Internet technologies such as cookies, pixel tracking
		and web server log data. The information we collect about all visitors to our
		website may include the browser type, IP address, referring site, additional
		websites requested, and the date and time of each visitor request. We collect
		this information from all website visitors, whether they have an account or not. 
		A cookie is a piece of data that our server sends to your browser. Your browser
		may then store the cookie on your computer and read it back to our server if
		you visit our site again. These cookies allow us to create a more personalized
		experience for you while visiting our website and using SmartDraw. If you're
		concerned about cookies, you can have your browser notify you when it receives
		a cookie, giving you the choice to accept or decline it. Without cookies, however,
		you will not be able to log into your SmartDraw account or use the online edition
		of SmartDraw.  Use of cookies are necessary to the performance of SmartDraw.</p>
		
		<p>The Company uses third-party tracking tools to improve the performance and
		features of the Services, and to provide a more customized and relevant
		experience as you use the Services. These third-party tracking tools are
		designed to collect information about your use of the Services.</p>
		
		<p>The Company uses Enhanced Google Analytics Tools (the "Google Analytics Tools")
		including Google AdSense, Remarketing with Google Analytics, Google Display
		Network Impression Reporting, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest
		Reporting and YouTube embedded videos as well as integrated services that
		require Google Analytics to collect data via advertising cookies and
		identifiers. You can learn more about the Google Analytics Tools at:
		<a href="https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/policies/technologies/types/</a>.
		Should you choose to no longer share your information with Google and no
		longer have your information collected by the Google Analytics Tools,
		you may opt-out by following the procedure outlined at: <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/" target="_blank">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>The Company uses Bing analytics and remarketing. Should you choose to no longer
		share your information with Bing, you may opt-out from Bing ad tracking by
		following the procedure outlined here: <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/ad-settings/signedout</a>.</p>
		
		<p>The Company uses Yahoo analytics and remarketing. Should you choose to no longer share
		your information with Yahoo, you may opt-out from Yahoo ad tracking by following
		the procedure outlined here: <a href="https://aim.yahoo.com/aim/sg/en/optout/" target="_blank">https://aim.yahoo.com/aim/sg/en/optout/</a>.</p>
		
		<p>When you communicate with the Company through social media, or provide a comment 
		irected at us through social media, we may use social media and other communication
		mechanisms available to us to communicate with you.  We may also promote content
		of interest to you through social media.  You may opt out or configure your
		social media account settings to limit promotion of such content.</p>
		
		<p>When you use the online edition of SmartDraw, in addition to the website
		information outlined above, we will also collect information about your
		activity when you use SmartDraw such as date and time of access, number
		of log-ins, UI elements clicked on, actions taken, data displayed,
		number of documents you created.  We also store all of the documents
		you create using the online edition of SmartDraw on our servers, unless
		you choose to use a third-party document storage service such as
		Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, or Box. Should you choose to
		use our integration with a third-party document storage service to store
		your SmartDraw documents, the user information provided to the Company
		from the third-party document storage service is your first name,
		last name and email address.  This will allow us to communicate
		with you (subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy). The documents
		you create and edit using SmartDraw and which are stored on one of
		the third-party document storage services will be uploaded to SmartDraw's
		servers during the time they are being edited, and the changes you make
		will be downloaded back to the third-party document storage service. 
		A temporary copy of the SmartDraw document will remain on SmartDraw's
		servers until such time as the editing session has been completed and browser closed.
		</p>
		
		<p>If you use the online edition of SmartDraw with third-party apps and
		add-ons (such as Atlassian's Confluence, Jira and Trello apps)
		information from your documents will be shared with those apps.</p>
		
		<p>If you use the SmartDraw for Windows Desktop Edition, a validation
		feature will from time-to-time verifies that SmartDraw has been
		activated and is properly licensed. During such a validation check,
		the validation feature will send the version number and the unique
		License number to our servers to verify that the license remains valid.
		In addition, when installing the SmartDraw for Windows Desktop Edition,
		a messaging system is also installed in order to provide you with
		periodic licensing and updating reminders. The documents you create with
		the SmartDraw for Windows Desktop Edition are typically stored on
		your own computers and/or servers (or your own third-party storage services).
		You may, however, choose to access and use the storage capability of the
		online edition of SmartDraw (if you have a valid license) to store and
		interact with your documents using the SmartDraw for Windows Desktop Edition.</p>
		
		<p>We do not knowingly collect information on children under the age of 18.</p>
		
		<h3>How We Use Information We Collect About You</h3>
		
		<p>The Company uses the information we collect to provide you
		with the Services, which includes using information to improve and
		personalize your experiences. We also use the information to
		communicate with you, for example, informing you about your account,
		new products or services available, security and other types of updates.</p>  
		<img alt="SmartDraw&#39;s use of information collected" src="https://wcs.smartdraw.com/about/images/how-we-use.png?bn=1510011143" />
		
		<h4>Providing the Services to You</h4>
		
		<p>We use information we collect about you to provide, operate, support and improve
		the Services we offer to ensure our customers can use SmartDraw as effortlessly
		as possible. For example, information may be used to: (a) authenticate your
		identity when you register and each time you sign in; (b) notify you when
		subscriptions are due to expire, (c) to pre-populate forms, (d) integrate
		with third-party storage services, apps and add-ons that you use; and (e) otherwise
		as required by law.  This processing is necessary for the performance of the
		agreements we have with you that permit you to use the Services.</p>
		
		<h4>Customer Support</h4>
		
		<p>We use information we collect about you to respond to customer inquiries,
		diagnose problems with SmartDraw, assist customers with their diagramming questions,
		and to provide other customer care and support services. This processing is necessary
		for the performance of the agreements we have with you that permit you to use the
		Services, as well as to serve our legitimate interest.</p>
		
		<h4>Product Improvement</h4>
		
		<p>We use information we collect about you for research purposes and to develop
		and improve our Services, including maintaining and improving the performance
		of SmartDraw, developing and adding new features or capabilities, such as using
		error reports to improve security features, and using search queries and clicks
		to improve the relevance of search results.  This processing is necessary to
		serve our legitimate interest.</p>
		
		<h4>Security, Safety and Dispute Resolution</h4>
		
		<p>We use information we collect about you to protect the security and safety
		of our Services and our customers, to detect and prevent fraud, to resolve
		disputes and enforce our agreements. This processing is necessary to serve
		our legitimate interest.</p>
		
		<h4>Communication, Marketing and Advertising</h4>
		
		<p>We use the information we collect about you to deliver and personalize our
		communications with you. For example, we may contact you by email or other
		means of electronic communication (including through the SmartDraw for Windows
		messaging app) to inform you about available updates to SmartDraw including
		security or software upgrades. This processing is necessary to serve our
		legitimate interest. </p>
		
		<h4>The Legal Bases for Using Personal Information</h4>
		
		<p>There are different legal bases that we rely on to use your personal information.  
		First, we use information we collect about you to enable us to perform the
		agreements we have with you that permit you to use the Services. For example,
		to complete your purchase of a license to SmartDraw, to register and maintain
		your account, to provide support, to handle refunds, to ensure that SmartDraw
		performs its basic functions in a secure way, or to respond to your requests.
		Without the use of this information, it would be difficult and in some cases
		impossible to make the Services available to you in a functional manner.</p>
		
		<p>Next, we may use your information for our legitimate interests. For example,
		we rely on our legitimate interest to analyze and improve the Services
		and our content on the Services, to send you notifications about software
		updates or information about SmartDraw or to use your personal information
		for administrative, fraud detection or legal purposes.</p>
		
		<h3>How To Access and Control Information We Collect About You</h3>
		
		<p>You can request that the Company update your information, request a copy
		of your information or request the deletion of your information. 
		You can exercise some of your choices by logging into SmartDraw, going to "Account"
		and using the settings available there. If you are an End User, you may need
		to contact the Customer to assist with your requests first.
		Your requests and choices may be limited in certain cases.
		For example, if fulfilling your request would reveal information about
		another person, or if you ask to delete information which the Company
		or the Customer are permitted by law or have compelling legitimate
		interests to keep, your choices may be constrained. Where you have asked
		us to share data with third parties, for example, by using a third-party
		document storage service or by using third-party apps and extensions
		that work with SmartDraw, you may need to contact those third-party
		service providers directly to have your information deleted or otherwise restricted.</p>
		
		<p>You may opt out of receiving marketing communications from us by using the
		unsubscribe link within each email or by contacting us at
		<a href="mailto:support@smartdraw.com?Subject=Unsubscribe%20me%20SmartDraw%27s%20Privacy%20Policy">support@smartdraw.com</a>
		or by phone at 1-800-768-3729 or 1-858-225-3300 to have your contact information
		removed from our marketing email list. Even after you opt out from receiving
		marketing messages from us, you will continue to receive transactional
		messages from us regarding SmartDraw. </p>
		
		<p>Even if SmartDraw is not currently provided to you by an organization,
		if you use an email address provided to you by an organization
		(such as your work email address) to access SmartDraw, then the
		owner of the domain associated with your email address (e.g. your employer)
		may assert administrative control over your account and use of SmartDraw
		at a later date. If you do not want an administrator to be able to
		assert control over your account or use of the SmartDraw, use a
		personal email address to register for a trial and/or to purchase SmartDraw. 
		Please contact your organization or refer to your administrator's
		organizational policies for more information.</p>

		Privacy Policy. Our vendors perform services such as payment

		<h4>EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield and Dispute Resolution for Customers in the EU and Switzerland</h4>
		
		<p>As pertains to the Company's processing of personal data it receives from
		the EU and Switzerland ("EU-Swiss Data"), the Company complies with the EU-U.S.
		Privacy Shield Framework and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the
		U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal
		information transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States.
		The Company has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the
		Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this Privacy Policy
		and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern. 
		To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our certification,
		please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
		As a participant in the Privacy Shield program the Company is subject to the investigatory
		and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission.</p> 
		
		
		<p>In compliance with the Privacy Shield Principles, the Company commits to
		resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information. 
		EU and Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding our Privacy Shield
		policy should first contact the Company at <a href="mailto:privacy@smartdraw.com?Subject=Privacy%20Shield%20SmartDraw%27s%20Privacy%20Policy">privacy@smartdraw.com</a>.<p>
		
		<p>The Company has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints
		to Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ("JAMS"), an alternative dispute
		resolution provider located in the United States. If you do not receive timely
		acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint
		to your satisfaction, please contact or visit
		<a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield" target="_blank">https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield</a>
		for more information or to file a complaint. 
		The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you. Under certain conditions specified
		by the Principles, you may also be able to invoke binding arbitration to resolve your complaint.</p>
		
		<p>If the Company shares EU-Swiss Data with a third-party service provider that processes
		the data solely on the Company's behalf, then the Company will be liable for that
		third party's processing of EU-Swiss Data in violation of the Principles, unless
		the Company can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>
		
		<p>Under the Principles, you have the right to access your information that the Company
		has collected from you. You may do so by contacting the Company via email at
		<a href="mailto:support@smartdraw.com?Subject=Information%20Collected%20SmartDraw%27s%20Privacy%20Policy">support@smartdraw.com</a>
		or by phone at 1-800-768-3729 or 1-858-225-3300. You have the right
		to limit the use and disclosure of your personal data by not providing said information
		to the Company or by not using SmartDraw. The Company may be required to disclose
		personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities,
		including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
		
		<p>You may request that the Company correct, amend, or delete your information where
		it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Principles, except
		where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the
		risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons
		other than the individual would be violated.</p>
		
		<h4>Updates to Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>We will occasionally update this privacy policy to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback.
		When we post changes to this policy, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this policy.
		If there are material updates to this policy or in how the Company will use your personal information,
		we will notify you by posting a notice of such an update on the privacy policy link and/or emailing
		you when implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to be
		informed of how the Company is protecting your information.</p>
