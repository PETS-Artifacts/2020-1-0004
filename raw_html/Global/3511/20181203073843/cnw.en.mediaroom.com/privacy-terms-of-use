In those cases, other privacy policies will govern that collection, use and disclosure of personal information and we encourage you to review other applicable privacy policies in advance of providing personal information collected by other means. What Information Do We Collect and How Is It Used? Personal Information: If you wish to register for any of CNW Group's subscription services or products, including those services and products of our subsidiaries, you are asked to provide a variety of information, including (a) mandatory contact information such as your name, postal code and email address, and (b) voluntary demographic information such as your year of birth, education level and household income. We use the information you provide about yourself to complete information requests to the extent necessary to operate the CNW Group subscription program and provide the required services. If, during any of our registration processes, you indicate that you would like to receive further information based upon your demographic information, or to receive additional information from companies you express interest in (or related organizations), those updates will be sent to you by e-mail. E-mail addresses are used to send information based on your registered services and product selections and to respond to general inquiry requests. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. If you decide at any time that you do not want to continue to receive the information or service for which you subscribed, you may log onto this Web site and cancel your subscription. From time to time we may offer enhanced access to content and materials for visitors who wish to register for such enhanced access. Access to such enhanced services will be made available on a subscription basis. You will be required to acknowledge your acceptance of such enhanced services, and the terms and conditions of such services, at the time you register or subscribe for the enhanced access. Automatic Data Collection (Anonymous Browsing): As with most Internet sites, the Web site collects a variety of technical data, including your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information. We do not log the specific identity of visitors. Technical data is used only to create broad demographic summaries of Web site usage and Web site activity (such as average time spent and pages viewed) to assist us in providing useful content that is tailored to be of most value to our users. For example, we use the information to: give the developers of the Web site information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, content, and services; and to provide advertisers, partners and clients with aggregate - not individual - information about our user base. Information about individual users is not shared with any third party. Cookies: Our Web site may use &quot;cookies&quot;. This technology allows users to move more quickly through our site. Cookies are small text files that a Web site can use to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the site. For example, a cookie may store your password, or note your particular areas of interest. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. We do not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside of the CNW Group Web site and the Web sites of our subsidiaries. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Web site may not operate properly. Web logs are maintained by this Web site.

We do not share the individual information we gather on our Web site with third parties. Subscribers' and viewers' individual privacy rights out-weigh any other considerations in this regard. There are no exceptions to this third party non-disclosure policy, except as may be required or permitted by law or as otherwise set out below. We may be required to disclose your personal information to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of the CNW Group; (iv) protect the personal safety of CNW Group employees and third parties on CNW Group property. Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, the CNW Group may decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its business(es). Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is CNW Group.s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. All personal information provided to us is securely stored on our servers. CNW Group has reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and interception by third parties of the information under our control. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information that is transmitted or collected over the Internet. LIMITS FOR COLLECTING, USING, DISCLOSING AND KEEPING PERSONAL INFORMATION: We limit the type of mandatory information collected by us to only the personal information that is required to accomplish the identified purpose of operating CNW Group's various services, as well as responding to e-mail inquiries initiated by a service subscriber or Web site viewer. If you request that no further information relating to a service for which you have subscribed be sent to you by CNW Group, the personal information in our records will be deleted or destroyed upon being notified of your request to do so. Personal information used in responding to general e-mail inquiries by subscribers and Web site viewers will also be deleted or destroyed when and if no further communication is anticipated with respect to the inquiry. KEEPING PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE: We keep personal information as accurate, complete, current and relevant as necessary for the identified purposes. An individual may challenge the accuracy and completeness of the personal information handled by us and have such information amended if the information is inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may also request access to their personal information. For these purposes, please contact CNW Group's designated Privacy Officer.

<h2>COLLECTION, USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION:</h2>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of the information obtained from you when you subscribe for any of CNW Group&#39;s subscription services, including: Portfolio E-mail; Webcast Calendar; Media Daybook; and Daily Summaries and any other information obtained from you through e-mail communications with you, whether general inquiries or otherwise, related to any of CNW Group&#39;s products and services.

In those cases, other privacy policies will govern that collection, use and disclosure of personal information and we encourage you to review other applicable privacy policies in advance of providing personal information collected by other means.</p>

<h2>What Information Do We Collect and How Is It Used?</h2>

<p><strong>Personal Information</strong>: If you wish to register for any of CNW Group&#39;s subscription services or products, including those services and products of our subsidiaries, you are asked to provide a variety of information, including (a) mandatory contact information such as your name, postal code and email address, and (b) voluntary demographic information such as your year of birth, education level and household income. We use the information you provide about yourself to complete information requests to the extent necessary to operate the CNW Group subscription program and provide the required services. If, during any of our registration processes, you indicate that you would like to receive further information based upon your demographic information, or to receive additional information from companies you express interest in (or related organizations), those updates will be sent to you by e-mail.</p>

<p>E-mail addresses are used to send information based on your registered services and product selections and to respond to general inquiry requests. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. If you decide at any time that you do not want to continue to receive the information or service for which you subscribed, you may log onto this Web site and cancel your subscription.</p>

<p>From time to time we may offer enhanced access to content and materials for visitors who wish to register for such enhanced access. Access to such enhanced services will be made available on a subscription basis. You will be required to acknowledge your acceptance of such enhanced services, and the terms and conditions of such services, at the time you register or subscribe for the enhanced access.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Data Collection (Anonymous Browsing)</strong>: As with most Internet sites, the Web site collects a variety of technical data, including your IP address (a unique number that identifies your access account on the Internet), domain, and Web browser information. We do not log the specific identity of visitors. Technical data is used only to create broad demographic summaries of Web site usage and Web site activity (such as average time spent and pages viewed) to assist us in providing useful content that is tailored to be of most value to our users. For example, we use the information to: give the developers of the Web site information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, content, and services; and to provide advertisers, partners and clients with aggregate - not individual - information about our user base. Information about individual users is not shared with any third party.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong>: Our Web site may use &quot;cookies&quot;. This technology allows users to move more quickly through our site. Cookies are small text files that a Web site can use to recognize repeat users and facilitate the user&#39;s ongoing access to and use of the site. For example, a cookie may store your password, or note your particular areas of interest. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. We do not record or store any information about your movements on the Internet outside of the CNW Group Web site and the Web sites of our subsidiaries. You can choose to decline our cookies (e.g., by setting your browser to reject cookies), but if you do, some parts of the Web site may not operate properly. Web logs are maintained by this Web site.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Your Information to Third Parties</h2>

<p>The information we collect is helpful to us in the development of our service, but respect for our subscribers and viewers and their privacy rights motivates us to closely guard and protect that information. We do not share the individual information we gather on our Web site with third parties. Subscribers&#39; and viewers&#39; individual privacy rights out-weigh any other considerations in this regard. There are no exceptions to this third party non-disclosure policy, except as may be required or permitted by law or as otherwise set out below.</p>

<p>We may be required to disclose your personal information to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court order; (iii) help prevent fraud or to enforce or protect the rights and properties of the CNW Group; (iv) protect the personal safety of CNW Group employees and third parties on CNW Group property.</p>

<p>Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, the CNW Group may decide to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its business(es). Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is CNW Group.s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions.</p>

<p>All personal information provided to us is securely stored on our servers. CNW Group has reasonable security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and interception by third parties of the information under our control. However, complete confidentiality and security is not yet possible over the Internet. We assume no liability for any damages you may suffer as a result of interception, alteration or misuse of information that is transmitted or collected over the Internet.</p>

<h2>LIMITS FOR COLLECTING, USING, DISCLOSING AND KEEPING PERSONAL INFORMATION:</h2>

<p>We limit the type of mandatory information collected by us to only the personal information that is required to accomplish the identified purpose of operating CNW Group&#39;s various services, as well as responding to e-mail inquiries initiated by a service subscriber or Web site viewer. If you request that no further information relating to a service for which you have subscribed be sent to you by CNW Group, the personal information in our records will be deleted or destroyed upon being notified of your request to do so. Personal information used in responding to general e-mail inquiries by subscribers and Web site viewers will also be deleted or destroyed when and if no further communication is anticipated with respect to the inquiry.</p>

<h2>KEEPING PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCURATE AND UP TO DATE:</h2>

<p>We keep personal information as accurate, complete, current and relevant as necessary for the identified purposes. An individual may challenge the accuracy and completeness of the personal information handled by us and have such information amended if the information is inaccurate or incomplete. An individual may also request access to their personal information. For these purposes, please contact CNW Group&#39;s designated Privacy Officer.
