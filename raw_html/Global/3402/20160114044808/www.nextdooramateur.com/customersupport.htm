<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>An 
Overview</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Pacific 
Century Int&nbsp; is fully committed to protecting the privacy of consumers of its 
interactive products and services. We want to contribute to providing a safe and 
secure environment for everyone, and in particular, ensure that our members' 
personal information is protected. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">This privacy 
policy extends to all Pacific Century Int&nbsp; operated sites including all of 
our Internet-accessible Pacific Century Int&nbsp; branded services, hereafter 
called simply &quot;Pacific Century Int &quot;. This Privacy Policy is to inform you, as a 
welcome visitor to the world of Pacific Century Int , what kinds of information we may gather about you when 
you visit; how we may use that information; whether we disclose it to anyone, 
and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the 
information we hold. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Finally, 
please note that this policy applies only to Pacific Century Int&nbsp; built and 
maintained Web sites that carry the Pacific Century Int&nbsp; brand, and not to 
any other company or organizations' Web sites to which we link or have 
affiliated to. We have clearly marked Pacific Century Int&nbsp; and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know 
where this policy applies. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
Information about all Pacific Century Int&nbsp; visitors that Pacific Century 
Int&nbsp; automatically 
receives from you</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">In general, 
our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and 
frequency of visitors, very much like television ratings that tell the networks 
how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. 
This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of a 
given site. This allows us to improve our services and ensure that they are as 
appealing as they can be. For example, Pacific Century Int&nbsp; uses a technology nicknamed &quot;cookies&quot; that tells us 
how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. Such cookies 
do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine 
information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable 
information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail 
address is. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We also may 
provide statistical &quot;ratings&quot; information, never information about you 
personally, to our partners and affiliates about how our members (collectively) 
use our services. We do this so they too can understand how much people use 
their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible 
Web experience.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
Information about you that you provide us</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes, we 
may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a 
service, join a members' only area, or when you order a product. We will need 
certain information, for example, name, Internet address or screen name, billing 
address, credit card number, or any other relevant information as may be 
required by our Credit Card (or other payment method) Processors to ensure that 
the transaction is genuine or that your right to access a site is of a bone fide 
nature. This is for our users protection as well as for our own.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We may also 
use that information to let you know of additional products and services that we 
believe would be of interest to you. You may choose not to receive such 
information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen 
when you sign up for that product or service, or by emailing via the link that 
can be found on the site that you have joined.<br>
We may also ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we 
can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium that is the 
Internet, but you may always choose to respond or not. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Additionally, 
we may provide you with an opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our 
Pacific Century Int&nbsp; branded services and these listings are also optional and you can 
make changes to or eliminate this information whenever you want to. </font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>
Disclosure</strong></font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We do not use 
or disclose information about your individual visits to any Pacific Century Int&nbsp; 
operated site or any information that you may give us, such as your name, 
address, Email address or telephone number, to any outside company or 
organization unless we are legally requested to do so as part of any Federal 
Investigation or to protect or enforce our own legal rights under any agreement 
which has been breached, or we believe has been breached, or to protect any and 
all copyright infringements. In such events Pacific Century Int&nbsp; shall only release 
information when Pacific Century Int&nbsp; believe it appropriate to and then only to the 
relevant authority.</font></p>
<p align="left">
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">It is your 
obligation to provide Pacific Century Int&nbsp; with accurate and up-to-date information, 
and failure to provide us with such information could void any Agreement between 
you and Pacific Century Int . We use the information that you provide for such 
purposes as processing your purchase request, responding to customer service 
inquiries, loss prevention, improving our service, communicating with you, and 
allowing our billing providers to provide customer service and thus fulfil their 
obligations to you. Pacific Century Int&nbsp; employees and associated site webmasters and 
copyright holders have access to your information on a need-to-know but fully 
secured basis. Pacific Century Int&nbsp; will not sell your information to a third party 
for any reason.</font></p>

personal information from users under the age of 18 with third parties. Pacific

Protection</strong></font></p>
