<p>&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em><u>Information we collect when you use Apps</u></em></p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">When you use one of your smart phone app, tablet app, or applications for other platforms (collectively &ldquo;App&rdquo; or &ldquo;Apps&rdquo; as applicable), we may also collect, for example:</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information about the functionality of the Apps you access and use. This allows us to identify those areas of the Apps that are of interest to our customers so that we can refine and continuously improve the Apps.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your device&rsquo;s unique device identifier (&ldquo;UID&rdquo;). Each App sends us the device&#39;s UID, a sequence of numbers or characters that are unique to your device. We use this on the first opening of the App so that we can confirm to our advertising networks the number of downloads resulting from clicks on their respective ad banners and other marketing tools. When an email address is provided, we associate this with your current UID/cookie ID for the purposes of providing a seamless experience across your devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

We do not collect location data unless you expressly use a location-based feature, and you can switch off location data collection at any time through your phone settings menu.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error reporting information. This enables us to investigate the error and to improve the stability of the App for future releases. As part of these error reports, the App sends us information about the mobile device type and version, the UID, the time the error occurred, the feature being used and the state of the application when the error occurred. We may use this information to investigate and remediate the error and to assist you in completing an impacted booking.</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="margin-left:.5in;">You have the ability to control what information an App sends to us. You can exercise this control either by changing the settings of the App under its setting menu or changing the settings of your mobile device.

<p><u>Data collected by business partners and ad networks to serve you with relevant advertising</u>. We may allow third parties to collect information about your online activities through cookies and other technologies. These third parties include (1) business partners, who collect information when you view or interact with one of their advertisements on our sites; and (2) advertising networks, which collect information about your interests when you view or interact with one of the advertisements or tracking mechanisms they place on many different websites on the Internet. The information gathered by these third parties is used for example to make predictions about your characteristics, interests or preferences and to display advertisements on our sites and across the Internet tailored to your apparent interests.</p>

<p><u>Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms</u>. Some web browsers may transmit &quot;do-not-track&quot; signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them. Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
