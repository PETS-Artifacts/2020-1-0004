		<p><strong>Personal information that we collect from Third Parties</strong></p>
		<p>We may collect personal information provided to us by other companies who have obtained your permission to share this information with us, or who need to share information with us in relation to goods and/or services you have purchased - such as our Microsite partners (see section 9 below).</p>
		<p>We also collect personal information from third party databases (for example for our fraud checks) or  from other third parties who are involved with your purchase of goods and/or services, such as aggregator sites involved with a quote or renewal for an Insurance product.</p>
		<p>If you link your Google, Facebook or Twitter accounts or any accounts from other third party services (like shopping research panels or public forums such as blogging sites) to Debenhams then we also receive information from those accounts to the extent you've agreed to this as part of your settings and that third party's privacy policy. </p><br/>
		
		<p><strong>Personal Information collected by other parties </strong></p>
		<p>Debenhams works with many third parties to provide goods and services, such as our store and food concessions and beauty brands. These companies may, from time to time, collect personal information directly from you to organise appointments or book their services, or for their own marketing and tracking purposes. </p>
		<p>If they do collect your personal information in this way, these companies will be acting as Data Controllers in their own right, separately from Debenhams. Any use of your personal information will therefore be subject to that company’s own privacy policy which should be made available to you at the time that they collect your personal information. </p>
		<p>Please also see our section on Microsites below for how we work with other partners, including our Personal Finance providers, to provide you additional goods and services.</p><br/>
		
		<p><strong>Personal Information of Children</strong></p>
		<p>Debenhams does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not intentionally collect personal information from those under the age of 16. If, following a notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, a child under 16 has been improperly registered on our site by using false information, we will cancel the child's account and delete the child's personal information from our records.</p>
	</dd>


	<dt>How we will use the information about you?</dt>
	<dd>


				<p>We use your personal information in a number of different ways, depending on the type of information provided. You do not have to provide this personal information but if you don't, you may not be able to purchase goods from us, we may not be able to provide certain services and you are unlikely to receive our optimal overall customer experience.  </p><br/>

		<p>If you have given us your contact details, we may use these (in accordance with any preferences you have expressed) to send you marketing messages by email, post, phone and social media to keep you aware of what we're up to and to help you see and find our products. This includes sending details of special offers, services (including our financial services) and promotions from Debenhams. </p><br/>
		
		<p>As part of running our business, Debenhams has a <strong>legitimate interest</strong> to promote our products using marketing messages to existing customers of Debenhams and/or those in a negotiation with us for a sale or service, unless you have asked us not to. </p><br/>
		
		<p>When we collect your personal data, we give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving those marketing messages by simply ticking the box. We also have lots of other ways you can stop marketing messages in the future, which we've set out below.</p><br/>
		
		<p>If you are currently opted-out of our marketing, you can always choose to opt-in to receive our emails by ticking the box at checkout or by amending your My Account preferences.</p><br/>
		
		<p>If you are logged-in, then your current email marketing preferences (which you can find in your My Account) will be displayed at checkout. You can change these preferences in My Account or using the options detailed below at any time. </p><br/>
		
		<p><strong>How to stop marketing messages from Debenhams</strong></p>
		<p>You can stop receiving marketing messages from us at any time. </p><br/>
		
		<p>For <strong>email marketing</strong>, the best way to do this is to click on the 'unsubscribe' link in any email you receive. You can also do this through your My Account settings on our websites.</p>	<br/>
		
		<p>You can opt out of other marketing as follows:</p>
		<p>
		&#8226; For <strong>phone and direct mail</strong> – you can contact our Customer Contact Centre (see Contact Us section below)<br/>
		&#8226; For <strong>targeted or personalised adverts</strong> – you can update your Cookie preferences at any time (see Cookie section below and our Cookie Policy for how to do this). <br/>
		</p><br/>
		
		<p>It might take some time for all our systems to be updated, so you might get messages from us while we fully process your request, but we will ensure that we mark you as having opted out on our database as soon as we receive your request.</p><br/>
		
		<p>We are working on improving our customer experience to allow you to opt-out easily of our communications and cookies and we will update this policy and our Cookies policy as soon as we have this in place.</p><br/>
		
		<p>Please be aware that stopping marketing messages will not stop our service communications (such as order updates).</p><br/>
		
		<p><strong>Banner messages and personalised adverts on other websites</strong></p><br/>
		
		<p>Like other retailers, we also target Debenhams banners and ads to you when you are on other websites, apps and social media. We do this using a range of advertising technologies such as ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers, as well as specific services offered by some sites and social networks, such as Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.</p><br/>
		
		<p>The recommendations will be based on information we hold about you, or your previous use of our services (for example, your Debenhams search history, and the content you read on Debenhams) or on Debenhams banners or ads you have previously clicked on.</p><br/>
		
		<p>If you don't want to see these ads, then you can either disable cookies in your browser, or reject cookies from the site you're visiting. Please see our Cookies Policy for further details.</p>

	<dt>Automated decision-making </dt>
	<dd>

		<p>Debenhams might make some decisions about you using your personal information which is based on profiling without our staff intervention (known as automated decision making).</p><br/>
		
		<p>You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated decision making which produces a legal or other similarly significant effect. However, this will not apply if the decision is  necessary for a contract, authorised by law, or has your express consent.</p><br/>
		
		<p>In most cases, we use automated decision making in order for you to enter into a contract with us (such as automatic fraud screening), or in ways which won't have a significant effect on you as an individual (such as our general analysis of data to gain insights into behaviours and characteristics of our customers). </p><br/>
		
		<p>We use profiling to tailor adverts for you, such as displaying Debenhams adverts based on your previous website interactions and purchase behaviours, how you access our services and where you access our services from. We do this to serve you ads that we believe you will be most interested in and prevent you from seeing ads that are unlikely to be of interest to you, or for products that aren't available in your area. You can choose not to be profiled in this way by opting out of marketing and by updating your cookies preferences.</p><br/>
		
		<p><strong>Personal Finance products</strong></p>
		<p>As we have an extensive list of financial products, we use automated decision making when you are entering into a contract for a particular product in order to:</p><br/>
		<p>
		&#8226; Monitor Debenhams staff compliance - as a credit broker Debenhams has an obligation to monitor how accounts are being processed in store by colleagues and be able to demonstrate this to the regulator (if required).<br/>
		&#8226; Review any Travel Money transactions to ensure Debenhams complies with Anti Money Laundering guidelines and any suspicious activity is reported.<br/>
		</p><br/>
