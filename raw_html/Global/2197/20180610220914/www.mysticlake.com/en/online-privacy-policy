      <div class="wysiwyg">
        <p class="p1"><span class="s1">This online privacy policy (this &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;) describes the information we collect from or about you through this Site. It also describes how we use and share that information and some of the steps we take to protect your privacy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>Scope of This Policy</strong></span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">This Policy applies only to information collected through this Site. It does not apply to third-party sites or to other websites owned by the Mystic Lake Casino. It also does not apply to information collected through other channels, such as over the phone or in person.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">
Some of the information we collect through this Site may be &ldquo;personal information&rdquo;&mdash;information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Other information may be non-personally identifiable, such as information collected by cookies.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"></span><strong>Your Consent</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Please take a few minutes to review this Policy before using this Site. By using this Site, you are consenting to the collection, use and disclosure of your information as set forth in this Policy. If you do not agree to be bound by this Policy, you may not access or use this Site.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>This Policy is Part of Our Terms of Use</strong></p>

<p class="p3"><strong>Additional Notices and Agreements</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><em>Privacy Notices.</em> This Policy may be supplemented or amended from time to time by &ldquo;privacy notices&rdquo; posted on this Site. These privacy notices provide a level of detail that we cannot provide in this more general description of our privacy practices. For example, certain pages of this Site may contain privacy notices providing details about the information we collect on those pages, why we need that information, and choices you may have about the ways we use that information.<br />
<br />
<em>Click-Through Agreements.</em> When you sign up to use a special feature of this Site, you may be asked to agree to special terms governing your use of the special feature. In such cases, you may be asked to expressly consent to the special terms, for example, by checking a box or clicking on a button marked &ldquo;I agree.&rdquo; This type of agreement is known as a &ldquo;click-through&rdquo; agreement.

<p class="p3"><strong>Types of Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><em>Information You Manually Provide.</em> Mystic Lake Casino collects the information you manually provide (using your keyboard, mouse, or touchpad) when you use this Site. For example, we collect the information you provide when you create an account, join our email club, or otherwise interact with this Site. Some of the information you manually provide may be personal information, such as your name and contact information. <br />
<br />
<em>Information From Third-Party Social Media Platforms.</em> You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on this Site by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform (such as Facebook or Twitter). By doing this, you are asking the third-party platform to send us information, including personal information, from your profile on that platform. <br />
<br />
<em>Information from your browser or device.</em> Mystic Lake Casino collects information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser or mobile device. This information typically includes your IP address, the name of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, the date and time of your visit, and the pages you visit. The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings. <br />
<br />
The information we receive from your web browser and device is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you. We may also review our server logs for security purposes&mdash;for example, to detect intrusions into our network&mdash;and we might share our server logs, which contain visitors&rsquo; IP addresses, with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify you.<br />
<br />
<em>Information Collected by Cookies and Other Technologies.</em> A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small file placed on your device when you visit a site that can be understood by the site that issued the cookie. We use cookies and other technologies to collect information and support certain features of this Site. For example, we may use these technologies to:<br />
&bull; collect information about the ways visitors use this Site&mdash;which pages they visit, which links they use, and how long they stay on each page; <br />
&bull; support the features and functionality of this Site&mdash;for example, to save you the trouble of reentering information already in our database or to prompt the settings you established on previous visits; <br />
&bull; personalize your experience when you use this Site; and<br />
&bull; improve our marketing efforts, including through use of targeted advertising.<br />
<br />
The information we collect using cookies and similar technologies is not, in and of itself, personally identifiable, but we may link it to personal information that you provide. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you may set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you when a cookie is placed on your computer. Although you are not required to accept cookies when you visit this Site, you may be unable to use all of the functionality of this Site if your browser rejects our cookies.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Information About Third-Party Cookies</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">In addition to the cookies Mystic Lake Casino delivers to your computer or mobile device through this Site, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons. For example, we use Google Analytics, a web analytics tool that helps us understand how visitors engage with our Sites. To learn more about Google Analytics, <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a>. <br />
<br />
Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer or mobile device for the purpose of tracking your online behaviors over time and across nonaffiliated websites and/or delivering targeted advertisements either on this Site or on other websites. <br />
<br />
You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our Sites. For example, if you don&rsquo;t want information about your visit to this Site sent to Google Analytics, you may download an Opt-out Browser Add-on by <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank"><strong>clicking here</strong></a>. Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to Mystic Lake Casino. <br />
<br />
In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to this Site or other websites, please <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank"><strong>click here</strong></a>. You will be directed to an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioral advertising purposes. It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on this Site do not participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviors may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies.<br />
<br />
Please note that the industry-developed opt-out mechanism described above is device specific. If you wish to opt-out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices, you need to visit the opt-out page from each device.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><strong>Your Choices</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Generally, we use the information we collect through this Site:<br />
<br />
<em>In General.</em> We respect your right to make choices about the ways we collect, use, and disclose the information you provide on or through this Site. We strive to provide choices to you at a meaningful time and in a meaningful place. This Notice describes some of your other choices, such as your choice to opt out of receiving &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; <br />
<br />
<em>Do Not Track Mechanisms.</em> Your browser may deliver a &ldquo;Do-Not-Track (&lsquo;DNT&rsquo;) signal&rdquo; to this Site. Because of the changing state of technology and indecision within the technology and marketing industries regarding the meaning of DNT signals, we currently do not make any guarantee that we will honor DNT signals.<br />
<br />
<strong>Previously Expressed Preferences.</strong> You may change previously expressed preferences regarding how we use information you provide on or through this Site. For example, if you have provided your contact information and receive periodic emails from us, you may decide to stop receiving those emails by clicking the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; link in an email&rsquo;s footer. You may be able to change other preferences through an account you create on this Site. Otherwise, please contact us using the information provided below.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>How to Access, Update or Correct Your Information</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">If you have created a profile on this Site, you may be able to access, update or correct your information through your account settings. Otherwise, you may need our help. Please contact us using the information provided below. We will respond to you within a reasonable time and, in any case, within the time limits established by applicable law. We may ask you for additional information to verify your identity. In most cases, we will provide access and correct or delete any inaccurate information you discover. In some cases, however, we may limit or deny your request if the law permits or requires us to do so or if we are unable to verify your identity.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>Steps We Take to Safeguard Your Information</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">We maintain reasonable administrative, physical and technological measures to protect the confidentiality and security of personal information you submit on or through this Site. Unfortunately, no website, server or database is completely secure or &ldquo;hacker proof.&rdquo; We therefore cannot guarantee that your personal information will not be disclosed, misused or lost by accident or by the unauthorized acts of others. Further, we cannot control dissemination of personal information you post on or through this Site using any social networking tools we may provide, and you should have no expectation of privacy in such information.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><strong>How We Share Information with Others</strong></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><em>With Third&ndash;Party Vendors.</em> Mystic Lake Casino shares information collected through this Site with third-party vendors who act on our behalf. For example, we may use third-party vendors to design and operate this Site; to conduct surveys; and to help us with our promotional efforts. These third-party vendors may need information about you to perform their obligations. Typically, they are required by contract to keep your information confidential and to use it only to provide services on our behalf; however, as described below, we may allow them to use aggregate or de-identified data for their own purposes or to market the products and services of their other clients. <br />
<br />
<em>Within the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community Tribal Government.</em> Mystic Lake Casino may share information collected through this Site with other departments and enterprises of the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community tribal government. These affiliate entities are permitted to use your information for their own marketing purposes and in a manner otherwise consistent with this Policy. <br />
<br />
<em>In Aggregate or De-Identified Form.</em> We use information collected through this Site to create a compiled, aggregate view of usage patterns. We may share aggregate information with third parties so we and they can better understand our user base. We may also share with third parties information about how particular individuals use this Site, but only on a de-identified basis (&ldquo;Individualized Data&rdquo;). Individualized Data is not personally identifiable, but it does reflect the usage patterns of a particular Site user, as opposed to Site users collectively. We may provide basic demographic information (gender and age) in conjunction with providing Individualized Data. Third parties typically use this information for analytical purposes and to market their own products and services. . <br />
<br />
<em>With Other, Carefully Selected Business Partners.</em> From time to time, we may share your information with selected third parties for their own marketing purposes. For example, we may partner with third parties to sponsor contests or other promotions, and we may share with these third parties the information you submit to us to participate in the contest or take advantage of the promotion. Before doing so, however, we may offer you the opportunity to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; or &ldquo;opt in,&rdquo; as required by applicable law. <br />
<br />
<em>As Part of a Business Transfer.</em> Your information may be transferred to a successor organization if, for example, we transfer the ownership or operation of this Site to another organization or Mystic Lake Casino ceases to exist in its current form. If such a transfer occurs, the successor organization&rsquo;s use of your information will still be subject to this Policy and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us. <br />
<br />
<em>To Comply With Laws and Protection of Our Rights and the Rights of Others.</em> We may disclose your information when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law, a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose your information to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to protect the security of this Site; to enforce or apply our online Terms of Use [insert link] or other agreements; or to protect our own rights or property or the rights, property or safety of our users or others. <br />
<br />
<em>As Described in a Privacy Notice or Click-Through Agreement.</em> We reserve the right to disclose your information as described in any privacy notice posted on this Site, or as described in any click-through agreement to which you have agreed.</span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Mystic Lake Casino is headquartered in the United States, and this Policy was drafted to comply with U.S. data protection laws.
