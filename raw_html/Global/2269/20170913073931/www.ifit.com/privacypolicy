Please note that prices and charges are subject to change with notice to your email address associated with your account. It is your responsibility to ensure that the email address associated with your account is correct and that your email account will accept emails from iFit. As used in these Terms of Use, "billing" shall indicate either a charge or debit, as applicable, against your Payment Method. The membership fee will be billed at the beginning of the paying portion of your membership and each month or year (as chosen by you during sign up) thereafter unless and until you cancel your membership. Please sign in to your account and visit the "ACCOUNT BILLING" tab of your "SETTINGS" page on ifit.com to see the renewal date for your next renewal period. We automatically bill your Payment Method each month or year (as chosen by you during sign up) on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of your paying membership. Membership charges are fully earned upon payment. In the event your paying membership began on a day not contained in a given month, we bill your Payment Method on the last day of such month. For example, if you started your iFit membership or became a paying member on January 31st, your next payment date is February 28th and your Payment Method would be billed on that date. For certain Payment Methods, the issuer of your Payment Method may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges. Check with your bank and credit card issuers for details.

IFIT WILL PROVIDE A NOTICE OF AUTO-RENEWAL TO THE EMAIL ADDRESS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR ACCOUNT OF RECORD PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF YOUR MEMBERSHIP. TO DOWNGRADE YOUR ACCOUNT TO A FREE ACCOUNT, SIGN IN TO YOUR ACCOUNT AND GO TO "SETTINGS" AND CLICK ON "ACCOUNT BILLING", AND CLICK THE "DOWNGRADE" BUTTON.
