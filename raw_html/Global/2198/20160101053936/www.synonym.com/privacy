                        Synonym.com shares information with third parties, but only
                        as described in this Section 4.

                            <li><u>Advertisers and Others.</u> We share
                            non-personally identifiable information with advertisers,
                            service providers, and other persons with whom we conduct
                            business. Conversely, these advertisers, service
                            providers, and other persons may share with us non-PII
                            about you that they have independently developed or
                            acquired.</li>

                            <li><u>Service Third Parties.</u> We contract with
                            affiliated and non-affiliated third parties to provide
                            services to us or to you on our behalf. Examples include
                            providing marketing assistance, providing customer
                            services, sending Synonym.com email to you, removing
                            repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing
                            data. These third parties have access to personal
                            information needed to perform their functions.</li>

                            <li><u>Business Transfer.</u> As we develop our business,
                            we might sell or buy businesses or their assets, or
                            engage in acquisitions, mergers, restructurings, changes
                            of control, or similar transactions. In such
                            transactions, customer information generally is one of
                            the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely
                            event of a bankruptcy, customer information may be
                            transferred to a bankruptcy trustee or debtor in
                            possession and then to a subsequent purchaser.</li>

                            <li><u>Affiliates.</u> We may share user information with
                            our corporate affiliates. Some of our most significant
