                          <p>In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this policy should first contact us at <a href="mailto:legal@legalgroup.com"><strong>legal@legalgroup.com</strong></a>.</p>

                          <p>We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit <a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" target="_blank"><strong>http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/</strong></a> for more information and to file a complaint.</p>

                          <p>Please note that if your complaint is not resolved through these channels, under limited circumstances, a binding arbitration option may be available before a Privacy Shield Panel.</p></li>

                         
                          <li><u>Security.</u>  We provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Service. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit on or through the Service and you do so at your own risk.</li>

                          <li>Updates to this Privacy Policy. We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the changes.  If you do not agree to such changes following such notice, you should discontinue your use of the Service prior to the time the modified privacy policy takes effect.  If you continue using the Service after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy policy.</li>
