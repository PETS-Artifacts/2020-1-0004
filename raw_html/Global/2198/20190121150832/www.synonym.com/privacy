          content and services (like registration, transactions and customer support), or to improve your experience
          with
          the Services, products and other services.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">With Our Partner Programs</span></p>
        <p>If you are directed to the Services through a third party, we may share certain information back with that
          third party, which may include information such as name, email and value of purchase depending on the type of
          relationship or Services utilized.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">For Marketing Campaigns</span></p>
        <p>From time to time we may disclose certain information (name, mailing address and non-sensitive transactional
          information such as your purchase history, amounts paid and products ordered) to marketing companies for
          trade or rental purposes. If you prefer to opt-out of the use of your personal information by marketing
          companies for trade or rental purposes, please let us know at <span class="bold">legal@leafgroup.com</span>.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">With Our Service Providers</span></p>
        <p>We may share your information with our service providers who work on our behalf. For example, these service
          providers may handle payment or credit card processing, data management, customer data pooling or
          aggregating, feature administration, email distribution, market research, information analysis, and
          promotions management. These service providers will only have access to the information needed to perform
          these limited functions on our behalf.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Social Media and Sharing</span></p>
        <p>The Services may use social networking or "share functionality" or may contain links to third-party social
          media sites or applications that are not owned or controlled by us. We also may allow you to use social media
          sites or applications to leverage your existing social media site or application accounts to access features
          of the Services. Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you
          by these sites or
          applications, depending on the feature.</p>
        <p>We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, any share functionality or the content, privacy
          policies, or practices of any third-party site or application. We encourage you to review the privacy
          policies and settings on the social media sites or applications with which you interact to make sure you
          understand the information that may be collected, used, and shared by those sites. You are subject to the
          policies of those third parties
          when and where applicable.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">As Required By Law or to Protect Rights and to Comply with Our Policies </span></p>
        <p>To the extent permitted by law, we will disclose your information to government authorities or third
          parties, including national security or law enforcement agencies, if required to do so by law, or if
          requested in
          response to a subpoena or court order, we believe in our sole and absolute discretion that disclosure is
          reasonably necessary to protect against fraud, to protect the property or other rights of us or other users,
          third parties or the public at
          large, or we believe that you have abused the Services by using it to attack other systems or to gain
          unauthorized access to any other system, to engage in spamming or otherwise to violate applicable laws or in
          violation of our <a href="/terms-of-use" automate_uuid="4b569ccc-c546-4e07-aa23-407da7884564">Terms of Use</a>.
          You should be aware that, following disclosure to any third party, your information may be accessible by
          others to the extent permitted or required by applicable law.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Business Transfers or Bankruptcy</span></p>
        <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets or any
          business, any user information owned or controlled by us may be one of the assets transferred to third
          parties
          in such transaction or event. We reserve the right, as part of this type of transaction or event, to transfer
          or assign your information and other information we have collected from users of the Services to third
          parties. Other than to the
          extent ordered by a bankruptcy or other court, the use and disclosure of all transferred user information
          will be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any information you submit or that is collected after this
          type of transfer may be subject
          to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity or acquirer, as applicable.</p>

          Privacy Shield Principles will govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view our
          certification page, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/" automate_uuid="e7477ff7-11d2-4c11-a3e4-b708b26ec117"><span
              class="bold">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</span></a>.</p>
        <p>In compliance with the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, we are committed to resolving
          complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union or Swiss
          individuals with inquiries or complaints regarding this Privacy Policy should first contact us at<span class="bold">
            legal@leafgroup.com</span>.</p>
        <p>We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield
          Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the <span class="bold">BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD</span>,
          a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council
          of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your
          complaint is not satisfactorily
          addressed, please visit <a href="http://www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/" automate_uuid="49280842-829a-4c97-848e-a8cc4e5d748e"><span

        <h2>7. The Privacy of Children</h2>
        <p>The Services are not intended for children under age 16. We do not knowingly collect or distribute personal
          information from or about children under the age of 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or
          her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at <span class="bold">legal@leafgroup.com</span>.</p>
        <h2>8. Security Measures and Storage Limits</h2>
        <p>We provide industry-standard physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal data we
          process and maintain. For example, we take reasonable measures to limit access to this data to authorized
          employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our
          Services. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for data we process and
          maintain, no security system can
          prevent all potential security breaches. As a result, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any
          information you transmit on or through the Services and you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>Our retention periods for personal data are based on our business needs and legal requirements. We retain
          personal data for as long as is necessary for the processing purpose(s) for which the information was
          collected, and any other permissible, related purpose. For example, we may retain certain transaction details
          and correspondence until the time limit for claims arising from the transaction has expired, or to comply
          with regulatory requirements
          regarding the retention of such data. When personal data is no longer needed, we either irreversibly
          anonymize the data (and we may further retain and use the anonymized information) or securely destroy the
          data.</p>
        <h2>9. Updates to this Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We will notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by at least thirty (30) days before the
          effective date of the changes. If you do not agree to such changes following such notice, you should
          discontinue
          your use of the Services prior to the time the modified privacy policy takes effect. If you continue using
          the Services after the modified privacy policy takes effect, you will be bound by the modified privacy
          policy.</p>
