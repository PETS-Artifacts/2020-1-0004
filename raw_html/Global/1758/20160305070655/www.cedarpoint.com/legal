<p>You will indemnify and hold the Company and the Company Parties harmless with respect to any and all claims and demands, including, but not limited to reasonable attorney fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of (i) your breach of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any infringement by you of the copyright or intellectual property rights of any third party; (ii) your fraudulent or malicious use of any Site and/or Services or your misuse or abuse of any Site and/or Services; (iii) your violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations in connection with your use of any Site or Services, or (iv) our use of Materials generated or uploaded by you in accordance with these Terms of Use.</p>  

<a name="c16"></a>
<h3>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</h3> 
<p>These Terms of Use are governed by the laws of the State of Ohio, U.S.A. without regard to conflicts of laws principles.  Any action you bring relating in any way to these Terms of Use or any matters related to the Sites shall be brought in either the State or Federal Courts located in Erie County, Ohio and you expressly consent to the jurisdiction of said courts. If any provision of this Agreement is void or unenforceable in whole or in part, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. Any cause of action you may have with respect to your use of these Sites must be commenced within one (1) year after the claim or cause of action arises, otherwise the cause shall be forever barred.

<a name="c17"></a>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>If any part of these Terms of Use is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations contained herein, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in effect.  A printed version of these Terms of Use and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to the Terms of Use to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form.  Except as otherwise specified in these Terms of Use, all notices, permissions and approvals hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given upon: (i) personal delivery, (ii) the second business day after mailing, (iii) the second business day after sending by confirmed facsimile, or (iv) the first business day after sending by email.  Notices to us must be sent in writing to the following address: 1 Cedar Point Drive, Sandusky OH 44870, ATTN: Investor Relations or Investing@cedarfair.com, and notices to you will be sent to the email address you provide to us, which addresses may be updated from time to time upon written notice to the other party.  The Services, Content, other technology we may make available, and derivatives thereof may be subject to laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions.  No forbearance or delay by either party in enforcing its rights shall prejudice or restrict the rights of that party, and no waiver of any such rights or of any breach of any contractual terms shall be deemed to be a waiver of any other right or of any later breach.  You may not assign any of your rights or obligations hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise.  We may assign our rights and privileges under these Terms of Use (including your user registration), without your consent in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or to an affiliate, or in connection with a change in control.  Subject to the foregoing, these Terms of Use shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.</p>
