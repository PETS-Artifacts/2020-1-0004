							a university in the U.S. United Kingdom or Canada (the "Site
							School Requirements") to use this Site, but certain features on
							this Site may be subject to heightened age and/or other
							eligibility requirements. For example, if this Site requires you
							to be at least 17 years of age, please be aware that certain
							areas on the Site may contain content for which you must be
							greater than the Site Minimum Age to access and view even if this
							Site's age eligibility requirements are less than the Site
							Minimum Age. If you are not yet the Site Minimum Age or the
							required greater age for certain features, do not meet the Site
							School Requirements and/or do not meet any other eligibility
							requirements, or, if for any reason, you do not agree with all of
							the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement, please
							discontinue using the Site immediately because by using or
							attempting to use the Site, you certify that you are at least the
							Site Minimum Age or other required greater age for certain
							features, meet the Site School Requirements, meet any other
							eligibility and residency requirements of the Site and agree to

							shall govern. This Agreement will remain in full force and effect
							as long as you are a user of the Site and, in the event of
							termination of any membership, service or feature, you will still
							be bound by your obligations under this Agreement (including, but
							not limited to, the <a href="#privacy" id="samePage">Privacy

						<p class="bold">19.3 Arbitration Proceedings and Costs.</p>
						<p>
							Any arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration

								Rules</span>"), as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules, and other
							information about the AAA, are available at the AAA's website at
							<span class="underline">www.adr.org</span>. A form for initiating
							arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website (see
							Demand for Arbitration at <span class="underline">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015820</span>
							and, for arbitrations in California, <span class="underline">https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_015822,
								but contact the AAA if you have issues accessing these links</span>)
							and arbitration proceedings shall be initiated in the location
							described in <span class="underline">Section 20</span>. As
							required by the AAA Rules, if you initiate the arbitration
							proceedings, you must send the original copy of the completed
							form to VII, which should be sent to VII at the following
							address: 1515 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, Attention:
							Viacom Inc. General Counsel. If your Claim is for $10,000 or
							less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted
							solely based on documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a
							telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing under the AAA
							Rules. In all cases, you and VII shall exchange documents and
							other information that you or VII intend to use in the
							arbitration.
						</p>
						<p>Upon filing of an arbitration demand for Claims up to
							$75,000, VII will reimburse you for all necessary filing,
							administration and arbitrator fees paid by you to the AAA or, if
							you wish VII to pay such fees directly to the AAA, you must
							request payment of such fees by VII by mail to the AAA along with
							your form initiating arbitration and VII will make arrangements
							to pay such fees directly to the AAA. In the event the arbitrator
							determines that the Claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are
							frivolous or vexatious, you agree to reimburse VII for all fees
							associated with the arbitration paid by VII on your behalf. You
							agree that VII shall have no obligation to pay any other fees
							except as determined by the arbitrator.</p>
						<p>For Claims that total more than $75,000, the AAA Rules will
							govern payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees to
							the maximum extent permitted by law. The decision of the
							arbitrator will be binding and conclusive on all parties, and
							judgment to enforce the decision may be entered by any court of
							competent jurisdiction.</p>

								ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR
								REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.</span> You and VII expressly agree that any
							Claim is personal to you and VII, shall only be resolved by an
							individual arbitration (or individual court proceedings with
							respect to Claims excluded from mandatory arbitration as
							described in <span class="underline">Section 19.1</span> of this Agreement), and shall in no
							event be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any
							other representative proceeding. The arbitrator (or court if the
							Claim is excluded from mandatory arbitration as described in
							<span class="underline">Section 19.1</span> of this Agreement) may only conduct an individual
							arbitration (or court action if the Claim is excluded from
							mandatory arbitration as described in <span class="underline">Section 19.1</span> of this
							Agreement), and may not consolidate more than one person's claims
							and may not preside over any form of representative or class

								</div>

								<p class="bold">3.2 Information Collected Through Use of

								<div class="indent">
									<p>
										The Site and/or third parties may use “cookies”, “web
										beacons”, Flash local shared objects and other similar
										tracking technologies (collectively, “<span class="underline">Tracking
											Technologies</span>”) to collect Other Information automatically as
										you browse the Site and the web. "<span class="underline">Cookies</span>"
										are typically html or browser-based text or other files (and
										often referred to as browser cookies) that help store
										information, user preferences and/or user activity. “<span
											class="underline">Web beacons</span>” (also known as image
										tags, gif, tracking pixels or web bugs) are small pieces of
										code used to collect data, such as counting page views,
										promotion views or advertising responses. Flash local shared
										objects (“<span class="underline">LSOs</span>”) (sometimes
										known as Flash cookies and used if Adobe Flash is used) are
										text or other files that help store user preferences and/or
										activity.
									</p>
									<p>
										These Tracking Technologies collect “click stream” data and
										additional Other Information regarding your visits to the Site
										(such as your visits to the Site’s webpages, type of browser
										use, type of operating system used, date and time of viewing,
										use of our features and purchasing history or preferences) or
										other websites, applications or interactive services. Through
										these Tracking Technologies, we may collect such Other
										Information across multiple sessions on this Site and other
										websites, applications or other interactive services and may
										also collect or access your IP address (which is automatically
										assigned to any Device(s) and/or Device and Internet browser
										combination you use to access the Site) and/or set or access
										some other identifier unique to the Device(s), Device platform
										and/or Device-Internet browser combination you use to access
										the Site (“<span class="underline">Identifier</span>”). For
										example, we may set a unique alphanumeric Identifier unique to
										your home computer on Firefox, or access an Identifier
										provided by a mobile platform, such as the application or
										advertising Identifiers offered by Apple. Your Personal
										Information is not collected as part of this process but we
										may combine any or all of the Other Information we collect
										using Tracking Technologies and associate it and/or
										Identifiers with your Personal Information (such as your
										Single VII Sign-On ID) and/or with other non-personally
										identifiable unique identifiers assigned by VII or third
										parties.
									</p>
									<p class="bold">3.2.1 The Site’s Use of Tracking
										Technologies to Collect Information</p>
									<p>
										By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or
										otherwise, you acknowledge and understand that you are giving
										us your consent to track your activities and your use of the
										Site and other websites, applications or interactive services
										through these Tracking Technologies and that we may use
										Tracking Technologies in the emails we send to you. See <a
											href="#sectionp5">Your Choices</a> section below for more
										information on how you can withdraw your consent for certain
										purposes.
										
									</p>
									
									<p>
										We use Tracking Technologies to enable us to collect and then
										use Information as described in <span class="underline">Section
											4.2</span> “<a href="#otherbyus">Other Information Collected by
											Us</a>” under “<a href="#sectionp4">How Is Collected
											Information Used</a>” below. For example, we use Tracking
										Technologies to enable Single VII Sign-On, to prevent you from
										seeing the same advertisements too many times or seeing
										advertisements too frequently, to tailor your experience on
										the Site by delivering relevant personalized advertising,
										email marketing and other content and to record if you have
										opted out of receiving personalized advertising from us.
									</p>
									<p class="bold">3.2.2 Third Parties’ Use of Tracking
										Technologies to Collect Information</p>
									<p>
										This Site may additionally use a variety of third party
										advertising networks, data exchanges, data management
										platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or
										audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics
										service providers and other third parties (collectively, “<span
											class="underline">Third Party Service Providers</span>”) to,
										for example, facilitate personalized advertisements (“<span
											class="underline">Customized Advertising</span>”) and/or
										other content, serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure
										and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or
										traffic on the Site. Customized Advertising enable us to,
										among other things, help deliver advertisements to you for
										products and services that you might be interested in based on
										your visits to the Site and other websites, applications or
										other interactive services you have visited.
									</p>
									<p>
										Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and
										other third parties, may themselves set and access their own
										Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices
										about those Tracking Technologies (see “<a
											href="#trackingtpspa">Tracking Technologies set by Third
											Party Service Providers and Advertisers</a>” section below and “<a
											href="#mimtt">More Information on Managing Tracking
											Technologies</a>” section below) and/or they may otherwise
										collect or have access to Information about you and your
										online activities over time and across different websites when
										you use the Site.
									</p>
									<p>We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service
										Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies. For
										example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising
										serving services such as controlling how often you see
										advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same
										advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such
										Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify
										Tracking Technologies set by the Site. See also Section 5.2.1
										for more information on this Site’s use of Nielsen’s
										proprietary measurement software to collect and use video
										viewing metrics and other information.</p>
									<p>Except to the extent necessary to provide services to
										the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to
										Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to
										Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information
										collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order
										for the Site to provide Customized Advertising or in order for
										the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to
										the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or
										content effectiveness or traffic on the Site. For example, in
										order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our
										Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect
										about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier
										so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics
										services to the Site.</p>

								<li><span class="bold">You shall still receive

									third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled,
									if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only
									means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific
									viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads

									or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable
									Tracking Technologies set by third parties or unless we offer

								<li><span class="bold">Do-Not-Track Signals and

									anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.
									<p>We currently do not take action in response to these
