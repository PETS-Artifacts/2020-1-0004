                <p>ii. Third Parties‚Äö√Ñ√¥ Use of Tracking Technologies</p>
                <div class="indent">
                  <p>This Site may additionally use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, data management platforms, supply side platforms, ad exchanges, traffic or audience measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers, operational service providers (as defined below) and other third parties (collectively, "Third Party Service Providers") to, for example, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or other content ("Targeting Services"), serve advertisements on the Site and/or measure and analyze advertising or content effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site.  Targeting Services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in based on your visits to the Site and other websites, application or other interactive services you have visited. See Section 5(b)(i)(A) for more information on this Site's use of Nielsen's proprietary measurement software to collect and use video viewing metrics and other information.</p>
                  <p>Third Party Service Providers, as well as Advertisers and other third parties, may themselves set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device subject to your choices about those Tracking Technologies (see "Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers" section below and "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" section below) and/or they may otherwise collect or have access to Information about you and your online activities over time and across different websites when you use the Site.</p>
                  <p>We may also enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers so that the Site may set Tracking Technologies.  For example, to the extent necessary to provide basic advertising serving services such as controlling how often you see advertisements or ensuring you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, we may enlist the assistance of such Third Party Service Providers to create, customize or modify Tracking Technologies set by the Site.</p>
                  <p>Except to the extent necessary to provide services to the Site, Third Party Service Providers do not have access to Tracking Technologies set by the Site, but we may provide to Third Party Service Providers certain Other Information collected by Tracking Technologies set by the Site in order for the Site to provide Targeting Services or in order for the Third Party Service Providers to provide other services to the Site, such as measuring or analyzing advertising or content effectiveness or traffic on the Site.  For example, in order to analyze traffic on the Site, we may provide to our Third Party Service Providers certain information we collect about your interaction with the Site along with an Identifier so that the Third Party Service Provider may provide analytics services to the Site.</p>

              <div class="indent">
                <p>A. Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may collect Other Information about you when you visit this Site for Targeting Services to help identify products and services that may interest you and deliver advertising and/or other content tailored to your interests.   Your opt-out options regarding these Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers are described below.</p>

                <ul class="indent">
                  <li>You can opt-out of the use of Other Information for certain advertising purposes by using opt-out tools provided by certain Third Party Service Providers as described here. You can access the <a href="http://www.donottarget.com">Adobe Audience Manager</a> (formerly known as Demdex) tool and Google's <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/">DoubleClick tool</a>.  If you use such opt-out tools, your choices only apply to the Third Party Service Providers identified in such link.  <span class="bold">Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.</span></li>

                  <li>In addition to the Third Party Service Providers listed above, other Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers may participate in the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative's Opt-Out Tool</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>.

Please note that, if third party browser cookies are disabled (whether by you or automatically by the browser or Device) or you subsequently delete browser cookies, the opt-out choices you have exercised may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.</li>

                  <li>You may also prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls for the Internet browser as further described <a href="/assets/chilis/Rider.pdf" download>here</a>.  Please note that using those controls shall affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.</li>

              <p><span class="bold">ii. Tracking Technologies Set By the Site.</span>  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, you have a number of options:</p>
              <ul class="indent">
                <li>You can prevent the use of certain Tracking Technologies for a particular Device and Internet browser combination by using the controls in your Internet browser as further described <a href="/assets/chilis/Rider.pdf" download>here</a>.  Please note that using those controls shall affect Tracking Technologies which are browser cookies but may not affect other Tracking Technologies such as Flash LSOs.</li>

                <li>See the "More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies" section below for additional information about managing Tracking Technologies set by the Site.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This Site is committed to complying with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.  Click <a href="http://srp.viacom.com/sitefaq.html">here</a> for more information about this Site and online behavioral advertising.</p>

              <p><span class="bold">iii.  More Information on Managing Tracking Technologies.</span>  With respect to the Tracking Technologies set by the Site, Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, please note the following with respect to the above opt-out options:</p>
              <ul class="indent">
                <li><span class="bold">The tools discussed above are "Internet browser cookie based."</span>  This means that the tools rely on cookies to remember your choices.  For example, if you delete Tracking Technologies using the controls in your Web browser (a process described above) after disabling such Tracking Technologies, you may have to disable such Tracking Technologies again to re-establish your preferences and, if you exercise Site's personalization opt-out when you are not logged in, and then delete browser cookies, you may need to use the Site's personalization opt-out tool again.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">The above tools are "Internet browser and Device-specific"</span>  Note that when you exercise your options using controls for the Internet browser, your choices shall only apply to the specific Internet browser on that Device.  This means, for example, that if you block or disable browser cookies for Internet Explorer 9 on one Device, this choice shall not block or disable browser cookies when you use Mozilla Firefox on the same Device or on a different Device using Internet Explorer 9.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Automatic Disabling of Third Party Cookies and Effect on Certain Opt-Outs.</span>  Some Device manufacturers and/or browsers (such as Safari) may preset their browser to automatically disable browser cookies from websites, applications or other interactive services other than those you visit directly (sometimes referred to as third party cookies) and, if so, the opt-out choices you have exercised with regard to third parties may not function and you may need to enable third party cookies in order for your opt-out choices to function.  For example, unless you enable third party cookies on Safari, your opt-out choices made on the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising site and on the Network Advertising Initiative site may not function.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">You shall still receive advertisements.</span>  Deleting or disabling Third Party Service Providers‚Äö√Ñ√¥, Advertisers‚Äö√Ñ√¥ or the Site's Tracking Technologies does not mean that you shall no longer receive online ads.  If you delete or disable third party Tracking Technologies (or, if third party Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled, if you do not enable such Tracking Technologies), this only means that such ads may no longer be tailored to your specific viewing habits or interests, but you shall continue to see ads on this Site and you may see the same advertisement repeatedly or may see advertisements more frequently unless you enable Tracking Technologies set by third parties, unless such frequency capping is provided through Tracking Technologies set by the Site or unless you opt-in through alternative means that may be offered by us to enable such functionality.  Furthermore, as described above (see "Information Collected Through the Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies" section above), even if you delete third party Tracking Technologies, we may enlist the assistance of Third Party Service Providers in order for the Site to set Tracking Technologies, for example, to ensure you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly or to limit how often you see advertisements.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Limitations Regarding Web Beacons.</span>  Web beacons cannot be deleted or disabled using the above opt-out options, but may be affected if such web beacons rely on browser cookies or other deleted or disabled Tracking Technologies to track your activities.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">How to Manage Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies)</span>. Control of Flash LSOs (sometimes known as Flash Cookies) Must Be Handled Separately.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE USE AND STORAGE OF FLASH LSOs TYPICALLY CANNOT BE CONTROLLED THROUGH YOUR INTERNET BROWSER.  Deleting, rejecting, disabling or turning off Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers and set by this Site through the above options shall not remove Flash LSOs.  For more information about Flash LSOs and how to remove them from your computer, please visit <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html</a>.  If you remove Flash LSOs, you may not have access to certain features of the Site and some of our other services may not function properly.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Other Effects of Managing Tracking Technologies.</span>  In addition to the above, if you delete or disable Tracking Technologies set by the Site, unless we offer alternative means to enable such functionality, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain features or functionality to you, such as remembering your preferences, remembering your username, saving your player settings or other purposes described in "Other Information Collected By Us" in Section 4(b) above, and some of our other services may not function properly.  In addition to the above, if you disable or delete Tracking Technologies set by Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers (or if such Tracking Technologies are automatically disabled on your Device or browser), unless we offer alternative means to enable such functionality, the Site may no longer be able to offer certain functionality to you, such as saving your player settings and certain services or advertisements may not work for such Devices or browsers.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Do-Not-Track Signals and Similar Mechanisms.</span>  Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" signals to the websites with which the browser communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  There currently is disagreement, including among participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals.</li>
                <li>We currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if and when a final standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.  Instead, as described above, please see the link to the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising program that we follow that offers you choice regarding Information collected for online behavioral advertising purposes and the browser cookie controls and other mechanisms described in this Section 5(b)(iii) and in Sections 5(b)(i) and (ii).</li>

            <p><span class="bold">Children or Ineligible Teenagers.</span>  If we, or VII, inadvertently send an email or text message to a person that does not meet the age and other eligibility requirements of the Site, such as a child (a person under the age of 13) or others who do not meet the greater age requirements of the Site or certain features of this Site ("Ineligible Teenagers"), the child (or Ineligible Teenager) or the child's (or Ineligible Teenager's) parent or legal guardian (the "Parent") always has the right to unsubscribe (opt-out) from receiving future emails or text messages via the unsubscribe mechanism contained in the email or message.  The same unsubscribe process is available to a parent or legal guardian of a minor (a person under the age of 18, or the age of majority in your state or country).</p>

            <p>In addition, Parents of children or Ineligible Teenagers who wish to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's membership must use their child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID to gain direct access to the account, and follow the procedures in the "Deactivation/Termination of Your Registration or Use" Section of the <a href="#use" id="samePage">Terms of Use Agreement</a> to terminate their child's or Ineligible Teenager's member; alternatively, Parents may contact us via the <a href="/utility/contact" target="_blank">Contact Us page</a>  and provide us with your child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID and request to terminate your child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration.  If a Parent does not have his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's User ID, the Parent will be required to contact us via the <a href="/utility/contact" target="_blank">Contact Us page</a> and include the Parent's name, address, telephone and email address, in addition to the child's or Ineligible Teenager's name and email address as registered on the Site, plus the child's or Ineligible Teenager's date of birth.  The Parent must also provide verifiable identification that they are the parent or legal guardian of the child or Ineligible Teenager. The Site will send a confirming email to the Parent via the email address provided to verify that the Parent wishes to terminate his or her child's or Ineligible Teenager's account and registration and may provide further information or request additional information before terminating the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account, .  The Parent must then confirm by sending a reply email to the designated return address.  The Site will then terminate the child's or Ineligible Teenager's account but will notify the child or Ineligible Teenager of the termination request via email and will identify the name, address and email address of the person making the request.</p>

              ratings should only be posted by users who have taken a class from the professor or who are currently
              taking a class with the professor. For each course a professor teaches, users are limited to posting one
              (1) comment. Campus ratings should only be posted by students who have attended or are currently
              attending the specific college or university being rated.

            <p class="bold">(2) Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled. </p>

            <p class="bold">(3) A statement under penalty of perjury that the user has a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled. </p>

            <p>When we receive a counternotice that complies with these requirements, we reserve the right, but not the obligation, to restore the material that was removed after forwarding a copy of the counternotice to the person who sent the notice of infringement and waiting at least 10 business days.  If, during those 10 business days, the person who sent the original notice of infringement notifies us that such person has instituted a suit to seek a court order to restrain the user from infringing activity relating to the material on our website, we will not replace the material.  Otherwise, we may repost the material at our discretion.  However, pursuant to the Section of the Terms of Use Agreement entitled "Postings", we retain the right to remove, block access to, or not restore material at any time for any reason without any liability to the posting user.  In particular, a user who sends a counternotice pursuant to this <span class="bold">Copyright Compliance Policy</span> expressly acknowledges and agrees that we shall not be liable to the user under any circumstances for declining to replace material.</p>

            <p>WE CAUTION YOU THAT IF YOU KNOWINGLY MISREPRESENT THAT ONLINE CONTENT IS NOT INFRINGING, YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO HEAVY CIVIL PENALTIES.

            <p class="bold">Repeat Infringer Policy</p>

            <p>We have a policy of terminating the accounts of repeat infringers.  A repeat infringer includes any user who has made two or more Postings for which we receive a notice of infringement under this <span class="bold">Copyright Compliance Policy</span>.  Each user agrees that if his or her account is terminated pursuant to this <span class="bold">Copyright Compliance Policy</span>, the user will not attempt to establish a new account under any name, real or assumed, and further agrees that if the user violates this restriction by opening a new account after being terminated pursuant to this <span class="bold">Copyright Compliance Policy</span>, the user shall indemnify and hold us harmless for any and all liability that we may incur therefor.</p>
