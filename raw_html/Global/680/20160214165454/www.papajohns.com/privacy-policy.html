        <p><strong>How we store the information we collect.</strong>We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases.
          Access to our computer servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.</p>
        <p><strong>How we use the information we collect.</strong>We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. First, the next time you use our online ordering service and enter your User ID and Password, we will

          including via mail and/or digital marketing platforms.</p>
        <p>We also use the personal information about you stored in our customer database through telephone and other non-online orders in various ways. Each time you place an order, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your
          order faster and easier. We also may keep track of your food preferences and restaurant choices and analyze that information in order to send you special advertisements, offers and notices regarding foods and restaurants that seem to fit with
          your preferences. We may also use the information to contact you concerning your level of satisfaction with our products and services, to verify incomplete orders, rectify problems or delays with your order or otherwise communicate with you
          concerning your transactions with us.</p>
        <p>We may provide your personal information to our restaurant affiliates and franchisees in order to enable your local Papa&nbsp;John&#39;s restaurant(s) to better serve you. We also aggregate information about how our online ordering service is used (without
          specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve our service and make it more responsive to our customers' preferences. We also make such aggregate information (without identification to any specific individual) available
          to our restaurant affiliates and other affiliates in order to obtain information about products, services, offers and notices which we believe will be useful and informative to our website users.</p>
