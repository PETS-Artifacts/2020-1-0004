      This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State
      of California as such laws are applied to agreements entered into and to
      be performed entirely within California between California residents. We
      do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our
      services, and operation of our site may be interfered with by numerous
      factors outside of our control. If any provision of this Agreement is held
      to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be struck and the
      remaining provisions shall be enforced. You agree that this User Agreement
      and all incorporated agreements may be automatically assigned by FictionDB,
      in our sole discretion, to a third party in the event of a merger or
      acquisition. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way
      define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.

      waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.
      This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding and agreement between
      us with respect to the subject matter hereof.<p>
