<section id='information-strava-collects'>
<h3>Information Strava Collects</h3>
<p>Strava collects information about you, including information that directly or indirectly identifies you, if you or your other members choose to share it with Strava. We receive information in a few different ways, including when you track, complete or upload activities using the Services. Strava also collects information about how you use the Services. There are also several opportunities for you to share information about yourself and your activities with Strava. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We collect <b>basic account information</b> such as your name, email address, date of birth, gender, username and password that helps secure and provide you with access to our Services.</li>
<li><b>Profile and use information</b> is collected about you when you choose to upload a picture, activity (including date, time and geo-location information as well as your speed and pace) or post, join a challenge, add your equipment usage, view others’ activities, or otherwise use the Services.</li>
<li>You can choose to add your <b>contacts’ information</b> to connect with your contacts on Strava and to send them your activity information while using <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/224357527-How-to-use-Strava-Beacon-Premium'>Strava Beacon</a>. If you choose to use these features, Strava will access and store your contacts’ information in accordance with your instructions. By submitting such contact information, you confirm that you have the authority to use and share such information.</li>
<li>Strava collects information from <b>devices and apps you connect to Strava</b>. For example, you may connect your Garmin watch or Flywheel account to Strava and information from these devices and apps will be passed along to Strava.</li>
<li>Strava may collect or infer <b>health information</b> which may include information such as heart rate or other biometric information, such as power, cadence, height and weight or other indicators. Before you can upload health information to Strava or information from which Strava can infer health information, you must give your explicit consent to the processing of that health information by Strava. You can withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health information at any time.</li>
<li>We gather information from the photos, posts, comments, kudos and other <b>content you share on the Services</b>, including when you participate in partner events or create segments or routes.</li>
<li>When you make a payment on Strava, you may provide <b>payment information</b> such as your payment card or other payment details. We use Payment Card Industry compliant third-party payment services and we do not store your credit card information.</li>
<li>We collect and process <b>location information</b> when you sign up for and use the Services. To record your run or ride and to provide you with your training statistics and inclusion in the Service’s features (for example, the leaderboard for a route), it is necessary to collect and record the physical location of your device including, data such as speed and direction. You can tell us about important locations, such as your home or work address, by enabling a <a href='https://strava.com/settings/privacy'>Privacy Zone in your settings</a>. We will make private any portion of your activity that starts or ends in your Privacy Zone. Processing of your location data is essential to the Services which we provide and a necessary part of our performance of the agreement we have with you.</li>
<li>Strava allows you to sign up and log in to the Services using accounts you create with third-party products and services, such as Facebook or Google (collectively, “Third-Party Accounts”). If you access the Services with <b>Third-Party Accounts</b> we will collect information that you have agreed to make available such as your name, email address, profile information and preferences with the applicable Third-Party Account. This information is collected by the Third-Party Account provider and is provided to Strava under their privacy policies. You can generally control the information that we receive from these sources using the privacy settings in your Third-Party Account.</li>
<li>To help us to provide you with the best possible service, you can choose to provide us with your <b>contact information</b> so we can better respond to your support requests and comments.</li>
<li>We also obtain additional <b>third party information</b> about members from marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine information that we collect from you with information obtained from other members, third parties and information derived from any other subscription, product, or service we provide. We may also collect <b>information about you from other members</b> such as when they give you kudos or comment about you.</li>
<li>We collect information from your browser, computer, or mobile device, which provide us with <b>technical information</b> when you access or use the Services. This technical information includes device and network information, cookies, log files and analytics information.</li>
</ul>
<section id='cookies-and-similar-technologies'>
<h4>Cookies and Similar Technologies</h4>
<p>When you visit the Services, a cookie will be stored on your computer. Generally, cookies and similar technologies work by assigning to your browser or device a unique number that has no meaning outside of Strava. Strava uses these technologies to personalize your experience and to assist in delivering content specific to your interests. Additionally, after you’ve entered your member ID and password during a session on the Services, Strava saves that information so you don’t have to re-enter it repeatedly during that session.</p>
<p>Most browsers automatically accept cookies. To manage the collection of information through cookies or other equivalent technology you can use the settings on your browser or mobile device. Strava is committed to providing you choices to manage your privacy and sharing. However, Strava does not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the internet industry has not fully developed Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions. To learn more about Do Not Track signals, you can visit <a href='https://allaboutdnt.com'>https://allaboutdnt.com</a>. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Services unavailable to you. Strava may also use your IP address to identify you, to administer the Services and to assist in diagnosing problems with Strava’s servers.</p>
</section>
<section id='log-files'>
<h4>Log Files</h4>
<p>The Services use log files. Stored information includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. This information is used to analyze trends, administer, protect and secure the Services, track member movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc., may be linked to session IDs, athlete IDs and device identifiers.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id='how-strava-uses-information'>
<h3>How Strava Uses Information</h3>
<p>Strava uses the information we collect and receive to administer and operate the Services and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we use your health information to provide you with statistics and visualizations representing key data points like heart rate. Subject to your <a href='https://strava.com/settings/privacy'>privacy settings</a>, your information, including your profile, username, photos, members you follow and who follow you, clubs you belong to, your activities, and kudos and comments you give and receive will be shared on Strava to participate in the Services, for example to show your place on a leaderboard. Location information, such as a route or segment may also be shared on Strava (in accordance with your settings).</p>
<p>We also use your information to analyze, develop and improve the Services. To do this, Strava may use third party analytics providers to gain insights into how our Services are used and to help us improve the Services. We may also use your information to market the Services, credit or accept payments, provide support related to the Services, protect members and enforce our <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a>, promote safety, and communicate with you. Additionally, your information may be shared with third parties, as set forth below.</p>
<p>Strava may de-identify or aggregate the content you make available in connection with the Services, in ways that do not personally identify you. Examples of such aggregated information or statistical data include information about equipment, usage, demographics, routes and performance. Strava may use, sell, license, and share this information with third parties for research, business or other purposes such as to improve walking, running or riding in cites via <a href='https://metro.strava.com'>Strava Metro</a>. Strava also uses aggregated data to generate our <a href='https://strava.com/heatmap'>global heatmap</a>. Please visit your <a href='https://strava.com/settings/privacy'>privacy settings</a> if you object to Strava using your information for these purposes.</p>
<p>We use your information to communicate with you about the Services, send you marketing communications (where you have agreed to receive such messages), or let you know about new features or updates to our <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a>. We also use your information to respond to you when you contact us. Strava will use your information to communicate with you, for example by sending you notifications.</p>

<h3>How Information is Shared</h3>
<section id='service-providers'>
<h4>Service Providers</h4>
<p>We may share your information with third parties who provide services to Strava such as supporting and improving the Services, promoting the Services, processing payments, or fulfilling orders. These service providers will only have access to the information necessary to perform these limited functions on our behalf and are required to protect and secure your information. We may also engage service providers to collect information about your use of the Services over time on our behalf so that we or they may promote Strava or display information that may be relevant to your interests on the Services or other websites or services.</p>
</section>
<section id='publicly-available-info'>
<h4>Publicly Available Information</h4>
<p>Subject to your privacy settings, your information and content may be publicly accessible.</p>
</section>
<section id='third-party-api'>
<h4>Third Party Business via API or Other Integrations</h4>
<p>When you choose to use third party apps, plug-ins, or websites that integrate with the Services, they may receive your information and content, including your personal information, photos, and your activity data (including private activities). Information collected by these third parties is subject to their terms and policies. Strava is not responsible for the terms or policies of third parties.</p>
</section>
<section id='affiliates-and-acquirors'>
<h4>Affiliates and Acquirors of our Business or Assets</h4>
<p>We may share your information with affiliates under common control with us, who are required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with regard to your information. If Strava becomes involved in a business combination, securities offering, bankruptcy, reorganization, dissolution or other similar transaction, we may share or transfer your information in connection with such transaction.</p>
</section>
<section id='legal-requirements'>
<h4>Legal Requirements</h4>
<p>We may preserve and share your information with third parties, including law enforcement, public or governmental agencies, or private litigants, within or outside your country of residence, if we determine that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with the law, including to respond to court orders, warrants, subpoenas, or other legal or regulatory process. We may also retain, preserve or disclose your information if we determine that disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate to prevent any person from death or serious bodily injury, to address issues of national security or other issues of public importance, to prevent or detect violations of our <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a> or fraud or abuse of Strava or its members, or to protect our operations or our property or other legal rights, including by disclosure to our legal counsel and other consultants and third parties in connection with actual or potential litigation.</p>
</section>
<section id='dmca-notices'>
<h4>DMCA Notices</h4>
<p>We may share your information with third parties when we forward <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms#claims-of-infringement'>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA) notifications, which will be forwarded as submitted to us without any deletions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id='how-we-protect-information'>
<h3>How We Protect Information</h3>
<p>We take several measures to safeguard the collection, transmission and storage of the data we collect. Although we strive to employ reasonable protections for your information that are appropriate to its sensitivity, we do not guarantee or warrant the security of the information you share with us and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction, loss or inadvertent disclosure of your information or content. No system is 100% secure. The Services uses industry standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of personal information and credit card numbers. Strava engages a company that is an industry leader in online security and Services verification to strengthen the security of Strava’s Services. The Services are registered with site identification authorities so that your browser can confirm Strava’s identity before any personally identifiable information is sent. In addition, Strava’s secure servers protect this information using advanced firewall technology.</p>
<p>To help ensure that these measures are effective in preventing unauthorized access to your private information, you should be aware of the security features available to you through your browser. You should use a security-enabled browser to submit your credit card information and other personal information at the Services. Please note that if you do not use a SSL-capable browser, you are at risk for having data intercepted.</p>
<p>Most browsers have the ability to notify you if you change between secure and insecure communications, receive invalid services identification information for the Services you are communicating with, or send information over an unsecured connection. Strava recommends that you enable these browser functions to help ensure that your communications are secure. You can also monitor the URL of the services you are visiting (secure URLs begin with https:// rather than http://), along with the security symbol of your browser to help identify when you are communicating with a secure server. You can also view the details of the security certificate of the services to which you are connected. Please check the validity of any Services you connect to using secure communications.</p>
<section id='disclaimer'>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>While Strava continues to work hard to protect your personal information, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and Strava cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Strava. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.</p>

<section id='eu-members-rights'>
<h3>EU Members’ Rights</h3>
<p>If you are habitually located in the European Union, you have the right to access, rectify, download or erase your information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of your information. While some of these rights apply generally, certain rights apply only in certain limited circumstances. We describe these rights below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h4>Access and Porting</h4>
<p>You can access much of your information by logging into your account. If you require additional access or if you are not a Strava member, contact us at <a href='https://support.strava.com'>https://support.strava.com</a>.

</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id='transfers'>
<h3>Transfers</h3>
<p>The Services are operated from the United States. If you are located outside of the United States and choose to use the Services or provide information to us, you acknowledge and understand that your information will be transferred, processed and stored in the United States, as it is necessary to provide the Services and perform the <a href='https://strava.com/legal/terms'>Terms of Service</a>.

</section>
<section id='retention-of-information'>
<h3>Retention of Information</h3>
<p>We retain information as long as it is necessary to provide the Services to you and others, subject to any legal obligations to further retain such information. <a href='https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918827'>Information</a> associated with your account will generally be kept until it is no longer necessary to provide the Services or until you ask us to delete it or your account is deleted whichever comes first. For example, where you withdraw your consent to Strava processing your health-related information, Strava will delete all health-related information you uploaded. Following your deletion of your account, it may take up to 30 days to fully delete your personal information and system logs from our systems. Additionally, we may retain information from deleted accounts to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect fees, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with investigations, enforce the Terms of Service and take other actions permitted by law. The information we retain will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Information about you that is no longer necessary and relevant to provide our Services may be de-identified and aggregated with other non-personal data to provide insights which are commercially valuable to Strava, such as statistics of the use of the Services. For example, we may retain publicly available segments or routes and other depersonalized geolocation information to continue to improve the Services and to use in <a href='https://metro.strava.com'>Strava Metro</a> and our <a href='https://strava.com/heatmap'>global heatmap</a>. This information will be de-associated with your name and other identifiers.</p>

<section id='other-strava-sites'>
