                <h2>What information may be collected and the means of collection</h2>
                <p>Your information may be collected in several ways, including: when&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>&nbsp;provide information to us, when information is collected&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically</span>, or when information is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">shared</span>&nbsp;with us by a third party.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>&nbsp;</strong><strong>provide to us through one of our websites or the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We collect information, including personal information such as name, date-of-birth, mailing address, and email address, when you provide it through registration to receive emails, request information, submit comments, submit product reviews or participate in a promotion (e.g., contest or sweepstakes) or survey. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network, viewing SC Johnson content such as a product promotion, and you&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">opt-in</span>&nbsp;to receive information from SC Johnson, the TV network website will submit to us the information you provided so we may contact you as requested.</p>
<p>If a SC Johnson website offers shopping or other commercial services, you will use an order-form to request information, products and services. The order-form may ask you to provide financial information like account or credit card numbers. This information is transmitted to us through a secured browsing session. Do not send us any financial information outside the secured browsing session.</p>
<p>Providing personal information to us is purely optional. However, if you refuse to provide details that are essential (e.g., as may be identified in a registration form), it would be impossible to use some of the features and functions of the website and/or to benefit from our services or promotions (for instance, by not being able to participate in a sweepstakes or contest).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information collected&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">automatically</span>&nbsp;</strong><strong>when you visit one of our websites or the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We, as well as any third-party advertisers and/or service providers, may place cookies, beacons or other tracking technologies in your browser to automatically collect&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">general non-personal information</span>&nbsp;when you visit one of our websites (<a href="#more-on-cookies-beacons-and-how-to-stop-automated-collection-of-information">more on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection later in this Privacy Notice</a>). Your IP addresses, which in some jurisdictions may be considered personal information, may also be collected through the use of automated technology &ndash; see more regarding the collection of IP addresses and the ability to associate browsing habits with your individual personal computer in this section below.</p>
<p>In cases when you are on the website of one of our promotional or advertising partners, our cookies or beacons are placed on your computer via SC Johnson content that you may be viewing (e.g., a product promotion or advertisement).</p>
<p>Information collected by cookies or beacons may be used by us or our promotional or advertising partners to deliver targeted advertising to you. The practice of displaying advertisements on the websites of unrelated companies is called third party ad serving or targeted advertising (<a href="#more-on-on-line-advertising-in-unrelated-websites">more on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (third party ad serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery later in this Privacy Notice</a>).</p>
<p>The type of information that may be collected automatically includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>internet browser type</li>
    <li>computer type</li>
    <li>IP address<strong>**</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>**NOTE</strong>: An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) so you can access the internet. Some ISPs assign a new IP address every time you access the internet while other ISPs assign you the same number every time you access the internet. In instances when you are assigned the same IP address, it is possible for information about your browsing habits to be associated with your individual personal computer.</li>

    </li>
    <li>operating system</li>
    <li>webpages visited</li>
    <li>links clicked</li>

</ul>
<p>This information helps us provide a better website experience by diagnosing problems with our servers, evaluating site navigation and better understanding the demographics of our site visitors so we can provide more relevant content, functionality and offers.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Information&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shared</span>&nbsp;</strong><strong>with us by a third party</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We may receive information about you from other sources such as public databases, data aggregators or companies/websites where you have consented to have your information shared with other companies. For example, if you are on the website of a TV network viewing content from a TV show, you may have an opportunity to sign-up to receive periodic communication/news about the TV show. While you are registering, the TV network also may ask you if you would like to have your information shared with the TV network&rsquo;s partners. If you consent to do so and SC Johnson is one of the TV network partners then we may receive some of your information.</p>
<p>We may also receive information about you from social networking sites if you or other users (e.g., your &ldquo;friends&rdquo;) give us access to your profiles, comments, or &ldquo;connections&rdquo;, if you &ldquo;like&rdquo; us, or if you choose to participate in a SC Johnson sponsored page or program residing in a social networking site (e.g., SC Johnson&rsquo;s Facebook page). The type of information that we may receive includes lists of your friends, comments you have shared, groups and location.</p>
<p>Our websites may also have &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; and other website features from third parties, such as the Facebook &ldquo;Like&rdquo; button and Facebook Conversations and other features which allow for login or other website functionality or interactions with social networking sites. These &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; and features, including their operation and use, and the information you provide to those third parties as part of their use, are governed by the privacy policy and practices of the third party providing them. Please be aware that we do not control and are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of such parties. You should review the privacy notices and applicable terms before deciding whether to use the third party &ldquo;plugins&rdquo; or features.</p>

                <h2>More on cookies, beacons, and how to stop automated collection of information</h2>
                <p>SC Johnson uses automated technology to collect general non-personal information. Automated collection of information occurs mainly through the use of two technologies: cookies and web beacons.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>More on &ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is a cookie</strong></span>&nbsp;-- A cookie is a small file that a website you are visiting places in your computer through your internet browser. Cookies have the ability to identify your computer and store information like web pages visited, advertisements viewed, frequency, and type of browser used.</p>
<p>Cookies are usually managed through your internet browser.</p>
<p>If the website you are visiting provides free content (e.g., espn.com) then it is likely that you will also see advertisements of other websites/companies. If so, the website you are visiting and the companies that sponsor the advertisements may place their own cookies in your computer. Displaying on-line advertisements in unrelated websites is primarily accomplished through a practice called third party ad serving or targeted advertising (<a href="#more-on-on-line-advertising-in-unrelated-websites">more on on-line advertising in unrelated websites (third party ad serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery later in this Privacy Notice</a>).</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is a web beacon</strong></span>&nbsp;-- Web beacons are small pieces of computer code placed in transparent graphic images displayed in websites you may be viewing or emails you may receive. Web beacons are not noticeable since they are usually placed within a very small portion of an image being observed. Web beacons are also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs, and web bugs.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How are web beacons used</strong></span>&nbsp;-- Web beacons are normally used to monitor website traffic. Web beacons can also be used with cookies to gain an understanding of how website users navigate and process the content contained in websites. For example, a company owning a network of websites may use web beacons to count and recognize users travelling through its multiple websites. Being able to recognize users allows the website owner to personalize users&rsquo; visits and make them more user-friendly.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to delete web beacons</strong></span>&nbsp;-- To delete web beacons, you will need to delete cookies from your browser (see the section above on &ldquo;how to delete cookies&rdquo;).</p>

                <h2>More on online advertising in unrelated websites (third party ad serving or targeted advertising) and how to stop its delivery</h2>
                <p>We and our promotional and advertising partners use information collected by cookies or beacons to engage in third party ad serving/targeted advertising.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is third party ad serving/targeted advertising</strong></span>&nbsp;-- Third party ad serving is the most common practice of delivering advertisements in the websites of unrelated companies. For example, when you visit the website of a sports&rsquo; network such as espn.com, you may see advertisements from unrelated sporting equipment companies.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How does third party ad serving/targeted advertising work</strong></span>&nbsp;-- Third party ad serving utilizes technology such as cookies and web beacons to assemble usage information from websites you&rsquo;ve visited. This information is utilized to try to understand your potential interests and match them with potential suppliers of related product and services. If one of these potential suppliers has contracted with a website that you are visiting to deliver its corresponding advertisement, your internet browser will assemble appropriate ad information and deliver it to you while you are browsing on the unrelated website.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How to limit third party ad serving</strong></span>&nbsp;&ndash; Your jurisdiction may have adopted laws or an industry self-regulatory framework that enables you to limit or stop third party advertising. An increasing number of advertisers have embedded an icon (such as an &ldquo;AdChoices&rdquo; icon) in or near their ads to indicate compliance with applicable self-regulatory frameworks. By selecting this icon, you may be redirected to a website that should allow you to limit or stop the delivery of advertisements to your computer. However, you should know that such icons (including the &ldquo;AdChoices&rdquo; icon) can only help you limit advertisements from companies that have signed-up to use the applicable icon to manage third party ad serving.</p>
<p>If and to the extent an advertisement does not include the applicable icons, you should visit the website where you are receiving the third party ad (espn.com in the example above) or the actual advertiser&rsquo;s website to view its privacy policy, which may provide information on how to stop receiving third-party advertisements.</p>
<p>You can learn more about third party ad serving and how to limit related advertisements at:</p>

<p>Please note that SC Johnson has no control over this advertising network or the companies that belong to the network.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What is Do Not Track</strong></span> &ndash; Do Not Track is a privacy preference that you can set in your web browser that is intended to allow you to control the tracking of your online activities across websites.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How we respond to Do Not Track Signals</strong></span> &ndash; SC Johnson websites do not currently honor Do Not Track settings that are enabled from your web browser.</p>
