                            Welcome to the Massachusetts State Lottery web site. Your privacy, and the
                            security of your personal information, is important to us. When you visit
                            this web site, we may collect the following information about your visit:
                    </p>

                        <li>Anonymous statistics as you browse the site.</li>

                    <p>
                            This privacy policy applies only to the use of the Massachusetts State
                            Lottery web site. Other web sites operated by state agencies have individual
                            privacy polcies tailored to the interactions available through each site. On
                            the Lottery&rsquo;s web site, you may also see links to external web sites. We
                            strongly suggest that you read the privacy policies for each web site that
                            you visit.

                    <p>
                            Your privacy with respect to the use of this web site results from a
                            partnership between the Commonwealth and you, the user. At this web site, we
                            attempt to protect your privacy to the maximum extent possible. However,
                            because some of the information that we receive through this web site is

                            this site may be made available to members of the public under that law.
                            This policy informs you of the information that we collect from you at this
                            site, what we do with it, to whom it may be disseminated, and how you can
                            access it. Based on this information, you can make an informed choice about
                            your use of this site and whether to share personally identifiable
                            information with us through this site.

                            whether a file you have requested exists, and how many &ldquo;bytes&rdquo; of
                            information were transmitted to you over the Web from this site. We use your

                            the Commonwealth&rsquo;s legal obligations. Where appropriate, we may

                    <p>
                            Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send
                            information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use
                            standard security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable

                    <p>
                            In 1999 <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a> was issued, which enhanced the privacy

                            the Executive Department of state government. <a href="http://www.lawlib.state.ma.us/source/mass/eo/eotext/EO412.txt">Executive Order 412</a> limits the

                            and the date when you last looked at a specific Web page, or to identify
                            your session at a particular Web site. A cookie file allows the Web site to
                            recognize you as you click through pages on the site and when you later
                            revisit the site. A Web site can use cookies to &ldquo;remember&rdquo; your

                            can prevent Web sites from placing cookies on your computer by using your
                            browser's preference menu, disabling cookies may affect your ability to view

                            An <strong>&ldquo;Internet Protocol Address&rdquo;</strong> or
                            <strong>&ldquo;IP Address&rdquo;</strong> is a series of numbers that
                            identifies each computer and machine connected to the Internet. An IP
                            address enables a server on a computer network to send you the file that you
                            have requested on the Internet. The IP address disclosed to us may identify
                            the computer from which you are accessing the Internet, or a server owned by
                            your Internet Service Provider. Because it is machine-specific, rather than
                            person-specific, an IP address is not, in and of itself, personally
                            identifiable information.
