<h2 id="4-tracking-technologies">4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>Headspace and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don&#39;t have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don&#39;t need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.</p>
<p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p>We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law.  We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms.

TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES\\n\\nHeadspace and our analytics partners use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don't have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested, and to measure how people are using the Products.\\n\\nWe use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.\\n\\nWe partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We will acquire consent from you in order to use such trackers for advertising purposes to the extent required by applicable law.  We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms. You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad preference in your Google account.\\n\\nWe use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by “clicking-through” our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms.\\nThe Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products.

For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit [www.google.com/analytics](https://www.google.com/analytics \\\"Google Analytics\\\").\\n\\n### MOBILE ANALYTICS\\n\\nWe use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you engage with the Products, the events that occur within the Products, aggregated usage and performance data, and where the Applications were downloaded from.

Your clicks on links in the newsletter are also saved. These and the open statistics are used in aggregate form to give us an indication of the popularity of the content and to help us make decisions about future content and formatting.\\n\\n## 5. WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION\\n\\nAll information you provide to us through the Products is stored on our secure servers located in the US.

If you have registered to use the Products through a code or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a “Community Subscription”), the Community will have access to your email address,, and the date you registered to use the Products, and the date on which you last used the Products.  The Community will also have access to general usage information on an anonymized and aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products. \\n\\nYour Community may also have access to your usage information on an individual basis if you have provided appropriate consent under applicable law for such sharing.
