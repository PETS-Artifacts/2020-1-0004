<h2 id="4trackingtechnologies">4. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h2>
<p>Headspace and our analytics partners, use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to enable a service to recognize your device so you don&apos;t have to provide the same information several times during one task, recognize that you may have already given a username and password so you don&apos;t need to do it for every web page requested, and measuring how many people are using services.</p>
<p>We use local storage, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on the Products also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.</p>
<p>We partner with third parties, such as Facebook and Google, to manage our advertising of the Products on other sites or platforms as well as across your other devices based on your past visits to our website. Our third party partners may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities within the Products to deliver such advertising to you, such as retargeting ads. We currently do not respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about interest-based ads, including how to opt-out of having your web-browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit www.aboutads.info/choices. Please note that this does not opt you out of being served ads. You may continue to receive generic ads on these third party platforms. You may also opt out of receiving ads across devices by adjusting your ad preference in your Google account.</p>
<p>We use third party trackers to let us know when users have visited the Products by &#x201C;clicking-through&#x201D; our sponsored advertising or content hosted on third party platforms.</p>
<p>The Products use Google Analytics code to gather statistical information. Google Analytics sets cookies to help us accurately estimate the number of visitors to the Products and the volumes of usage of the Products. This is done to ensure that the Products are available when you want them and are fast. For more information on how Google Analytics processes this information, visit www.google.com/analytics.</p>
<h3 id="mobileanalytics">MOBILE ANALYTICS</h3>
<p>We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our mobile software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the Products, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and where the application was downloaded from. We may link the information we store within the analytics software to any personal information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
<h3 id="logfiles">LOG FILES</h3>

If you have registered to use the Products through a code or other registration credential furnished by a Community (a &#x201C;Community Subscription&#x201D;), the Community will have access to your name and the date you registered to use the Products and will have access to your usage information on an aggregated basis with all other members of the Community that are using the Products. While we do not otherwise share your personal information with your Community, when you register to use the Products you will have the opportunity to opt-in to agree to share additional personal information as well as usage information with your Community, and in this case, your Community will have access to this information.
