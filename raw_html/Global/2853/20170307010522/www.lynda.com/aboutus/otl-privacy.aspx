<h2 id="Section1">1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</h2>
<p>We collect several types of information about visitors and/or users of our Services. We may collect this information either directly when you provide it to us or automatically as you navigate through the Websites or App.</p>
<p>(a) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Personally Identifiable Information</span>. &lsquo;Personally Identifiable Information&rsquo; refers to information by which you may be personally identified, such as your name, email address, or school. We will collect and process such data about you when you register for a Service/create an account, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a survey, or send us a communication. When ordering products or services on the Websites or App, you may also be asked to provide a credit card number and other payment-related information. You may also provide information to be published or displayed <strong>(&ldquo;posted&rdquo;)</strong> on public areas of the Websites (such as blogs, forums, message boards, and the like), or transmitted to other users of the Websites using &lsquo;sharing&rsquo; features <strong>(collectively, &ldquo;User Contributions&rdquo;)</strong>. Your User Contributions are posted and transmitted to others at your own risk. We cannot control the actions of other users of the Websites with whom you may choose to share your User Contributions. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
<p>We may also collect your Internet Protocol (&lsquo;IP&rsquo;) address. We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our servers, software, to administer our Services and to gather demographic information.</p>
<p>We do not collect more Personally Identifiable Information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity on the Websites. If you are a school and you use a Lynda.com service within the United States for children under the age of 13, you are responsible for obtaining consent from the parents/legal guardians of each child you wish to allow to participate in using any of our Services. A child using our Services will be able to participate in certain activities such as taking online educational and informational courses.</p>
<p>(b) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Non-Personally Identifiable Information</span>. We may collect, or our third party ad server and/or content server may collect, certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information, that does not by itself identify a specific individual. Such information tells us about your equipment, browsing actions, the resources that you access and use through the Services, your operating system and browser type. Our third party ad servers will provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how many ads were presented and clicked upon at our Websites. The information that we collect automatically is &lsquo;statistical&rsquo; in nature. It helps us to deliver a better and more personalized service to users, by enabling us to estimate usage patterns, customize our Services according to your individual preferences, and speed up your searches.</p>
<p>(c) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Device Information</span>. When you download our App and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use and the operating system version, so we know the best application version to provide you with. We do not ask you for, access or track any location based information from your mobile device at any time while downloading or using our App or Services.</p>

<h2 id="Section8">8. INFORMATION RELATED TO DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE LYNDA.COM PLATFORM SERVICE</h2>
<p>For certain services Lynda.com collects information under the direction of its clients (e.g., an entity that subscribes to the Services for use by the entity&rsquo;s personnel). In this respect, Lynda.com acts as a data processor and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personally Identifiable Information it processes. An individual who seeks access, or who seeks to correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data should direct his or her query to the relevant Lynda.com client (the data controller). If the client makes a request to us to remove the data, we will respond to their request within 30 days.</p>
<p>Lynda.com will retain Personally Identifiable Information we process on behalf of our clients for as long as needed to provide our services to our client. We will retain and use this personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
<h2 id="Section9">9. DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.</p>
<p>To make online purchases you must use an SSL-enabled browser in order to protect the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.</p>
<p>Access by you to your account is available through a password and/or unique user name selected by you. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone, that you change your password often using a combination of letters and numbers, and that you ensure you use a secure web browser. We cannot be held accountable for activity that results from your own neglect to safeguard the secrecy of your password and user name. If you share a computer with anyone, you should always log out of your account after you are finished, in order to prevent access to your information from subsequent users of that computer.</p>
<p>Please notify us as soon as possible if your user name or password is compromised. Call 1 (888) 335-9632 or +1 (805) 477-3900 for assistance, or email <a href="mailto:businessaffairs@lynda.com">businessaffairs@lynda.com</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Website cannot be guaranteed and we shall have no liability to you or any third party for loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration of such information; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personally Identifiable Information in our control may have been compromised, we will notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances. To the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">you consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification</span>. If you prefer for us to use another method to notify you in this situation, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:businessaffairs@lynda.com">businessaffairs@lynda.com</a> with the alternative contact information you wish to be used.</p>
