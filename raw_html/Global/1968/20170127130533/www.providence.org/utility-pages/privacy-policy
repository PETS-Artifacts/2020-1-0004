<div><strong>3. User Responsibilities</strong>
<p>
The Providence Web site is intended to help you be a better-informed health care services user and get access to Providence information and services easily, but we need your help to make it work well. We also need you to be responsible for doing your part to protect your personal information, and to understand that the educational information and materials made available through the Providence Web site are not and do not include medical advice, and are not designed or intended to address your personal health condition or issues.</p>
<p>Users therefore must be responsible for the following:</p>
<p>3.1. Be an Informed User<br />
Please read these Terms of Use carefully. We need your help in making the Providence site a safe and effective tool, and protecting it against misuse. Your violation of these Terms of Use is grounds for suspension or termination of your account.</p>
<p>3.2. Maintain and Protect Your Own Equipment<br />
The Providence site is intended to be accessible and all content available through all standard commercial Web browsers operating on standard personal computers, through standard commercially-available Internet access. The quality of content presentation and download speeds may vary depending on the software, equipment and Internet connections used.</p>
<p>You may be able to use devices other than a personal computer to access the Providence site, such as some personal digital assistants (&ldquo;PDAs&rdquo;), cell phones or other devices. If you do choose to use another kind of device to access the Providence site, you must be responsible for protecting it in accordance with these Terms of Use. Any requirement for personal computer protection in these Terms of Use applies equally to any other device you may use to access the Providence site</p>
<ul>
    <li>Providence does not provide any software, equipment or Internet connections. You are solely responsible for providing all software, computer equipment and other hardware, and Internet connections necessary to access the Providence site.</li>
    <li>Some features on the Providence Web site, such as the Career Advancement Center and Health &amp; Fitness class registration, allow you to create an online account. Your personal computer may store and automatically upload your user name and password for account access. You may also download information from the Providence site to your personal computer. If someone else uses your personal computer, he or she may be able to use these functions to gain access to your account or personal information. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for protecting your personal computer against unauthorized use. You are solely responsible for protecting the personal computers or other devices you use against unauthorized use to access your account.</li>
    <li>If you use a personal computer or other device provided by or shared with your employer, parent, spouse, roommate or other person, that other party may have the legal right to view all information stored on it. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for such activities. If you use a personal computer or other device which another person has the legal right to control, you access your Providence account at your own risk.</li>
    <li>Whenever you are done using the Providence Web site you should log off the Web site, and you should not leave your computer unattended when it is logged on to the Web site and someone else may be able to view the screen or use the computer. If you leave a Providence Web site session logged-in when someone else can see your computer screen or use your computer, he or she may be able to gain access to your account or personal information. Providence cannot log you off your computer or protect your personal computer against unauthorized access. You are solely responsible for protecting the personal computers or other devices you use against unauthorized use to access your account.</li>
    <li>Computer viruses, worms, spyware and other malicious software on your computer can be used to gather passwords and personal information from that computer, often without the user&rsquo;s knowledge. Providence cannot prevent or be responsible for detecting or removing malicious software on computers you use to access the Providence site. Affordable antivirus and antispyware software is readily available for personal computers. You should maintain and regularly use current antivirus and antispyware software on any personal computer you use to access the Providence site.</li>
    <li>Unauthorized individuals (&ldquo;hackers&rdquo;) and malicious software can sometimes gain access to computers through Internet connections, unless the computer has a working firewall. Unauthorized access of this kind may not be easily detected and may allow passwords and personal information to be gathered without the computer user&rsquo;s knowledge. Providence does not provide and cannot be responsible for implementing a firewall for your computer. Firewall software is standard on many personal computers and affordable firewall software for personal computers is readily available. You should maintain a working firewall on any computer you use to access the Providence site.</li>
    <li>Computer criminals may sometimes send e-mails which appear to come from legitimate organizations. These e-mails typically ask you to log on to a Web site using a link in the e-mail, and enter some personal information to &ldquo;verify,&rdquo; &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;update&rdquo; your account, or something similar. This practice is known as &ldquo;phishing,&rdquo; and is intended to get personal information from unwary users to use for identity theft and other fraud.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: lighter;">IN ORDER TO AVOID THE THREAT OF PHISHING, PROVIDENCE WILL NEVER SEND YOU UNSOLICITED E-MAILS THAT INCLUDE A LINK TO A PROVIDENCE WEB SITE WHERE YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF YOU RECEIVE AN E-MAIL THAT CLAIMS TO BE FROM PROVIDENCE, WHICH INCLUDES A LINK TO A WEB SITE WHICH APPEARS TO BE OPERATED BY PROVIDENCE, OR BY ANY PARTY ON BEHALF OF PROVIDENCE, AND WHICH ASKS YOU TO PROVIDE PERSONAL INFORMATION, PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION.</span><br />
<p>If you receive any suspicious e-mail which claims or appears to be from Providence, please notify us by calling the Providence Integrity Line at 1-888-294-8455.</p>
<p>3.3. Protect Your Password</p>
<span style="font-weight: lighter;">Access to your account and to personal information about you is password-protected. If your password is easy to guess, or if you share your password or someone else sees or steals it, someone else may be able to get access to your account. Please use a strong password, and protect it from other people.</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: lighter;">PROVIDENCE relies upon your password in allowing access to your account and cannot prevent unauthorized access if your password is compromised. You are responsible for all activity taking place under your password unless we have been notified that it is compromised. Please notify us at once if you believe your password has been compromised, and we will help you change it. You can contact us about possible password compromise at the Providence Integrity Line, 1-888-294-8455.</span></div>
