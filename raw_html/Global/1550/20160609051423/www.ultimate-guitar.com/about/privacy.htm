        <p class="ug-news-text">We at Ultimate-Guitar.com respect the privacy concerns
          of the users of this site and have created this privacy policy
          to explain (1) what information we gather from you when you visit
          our site, (2) how we may use such information, (3) your choices
          concerning how we may use such information and (4) the security
          measures we take to protect such information. Some information is
          collected on this site automatically through our technology; other
          information is collected only when you choose to give it to us
          (e.g., when you set up an account, register for a contest or sign
           up for a specific online transaction). </p>

        <h2 class="ug-news-h3">Information We Gather Automatically</h2>
        <p class="ug-news-text">When you visit this site, certain non-personally
          identifying information is recorded automatically by the
          standard operation of our Internet servers. Information
          such as the type of browser being used, its operating system,
          and your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number that
          your Internet service provider assigns to your computer whenever you
          surf the Internet) is gathered in order to facilitate our online
          operations and to assure an efficient online experience for you.
          If you access our site from a mobile or other device, we may collect
          information for that device (including operating system, browser,
          type of device) is gathered in order to facilitate our mobile operations
          and to assure an efficient mobile experience for you. We may use or
          share this information for security purposes, to generate group
          statistics about our user community, or as required by law.</p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">Among the purposes for which we may use such generally
          non-personally identifying information is for identification purposes
          in the event of an emergency threatening life or property, or where
          proper legal process allows using such information. For instance, we
          may use your IP address or other automatically recorded information,
          in cooperation with your Internet provider, to attempt to identify you
          if it is necessary to contact you or to bring legal action against you
           because you are violating the Terms of Service for use for this site,
           may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally)
           with our company's rights or property, or may be adversely affecting other
           users of this site or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities.</p>

        <h2 class="ug-news-h3">Personal Information You Provide To Us</h2>
        <p class="ug-news-text">We may request personally identifying
           information from you in a variety of contexts. For example,
           you may provide such data to us if you: (1) complete an online
           registration form (e.g., registering for an account, various sign-up
           forms for receiving email newsletters, registering for special
           offers, entering a contest/sweepstakes or responding to a survey);
           (2) fill out an order form to request information; (3) register to
           participate in message boards and chat rooms (if any) and other
           community features; or (4) purchase any products or services from
           us or another Ultimate-Guitar.com business.</p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">In such cases, the personally identifying
          information we request may include your name, email address, mailing
          address and zip code, phone number, and, where appropriate, a valid
          credit card number with expiration date (collectively, "Personal
          Information"). In addition, we may collect other non-personally
          identifying information such as your date of birth, gender, country
          of residence, language preference, hobbies and other information
          regarding your interaction with our site such as your viewing and
          listening habits, preferences and other customized activities in
          which you participate. Of course, you never have to answer any of
          the questions we ask you (nor choose to view or listen to any
          multimedia content or otherwise interact with our site), but

        <p class="ug-news-text">Ultimate-Guitar.com cares about the security of

          security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access,
          maintain data security and correctly use such Personal Information.
          When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer
          (SSL) encryption for that data. </p>
        <p class="ug-news-text">Despite many advances in information security
          technology and procedures, however, no commercially deployed method of
          information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is
          known to be 100% secure. As a result, while we do strive to use modern
          and commercially reasonable means to protect your Personal Information,
          we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its
          transmission or its storage in our systems.</p>

        <p class="ug-news-text">We are a general audience site that does not
          knowingly collect data or accept registrations from children under
          13 years of age. Currently, we do not collect any age-specific data
          on our site. If, in the future, we decide to collect any age-specific
          data on our site, we will, at a minimum, take reasonable steps to ensure
          that any users who may be under 13 years of age (and who attempt to
          complete the registration process on our site) are directed to another
          site within the Ultimate-Guitar.com family which specifically complies

        <h2 id="cookies" class="ug-news-h3">Cookies</h2>
        <p class="ug-news-text">A "cookie" is a small text file that an Internet
          site can place on your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.
          Cookies make using this site easier by, among other things, saving your
          passwords and preferences for you, keeping track of your shopping cart
          when you visit an online store or other similar purposes, and to help
          identify you whenever you return to our site, so you do not need to
          reenter your identification information. Most Internet browsers are
          initially set up to accept cookies. However, you can reset your browser
          to refuse all cookies or to alert you when a cookie is being sent (note:
          you may need to consult your browser's "Help" area for instructions
          on how to do that). If you choose to disable your cookies setting or
          refuse to accept a cookie, some parts of this site will not function
          properly or may perform considerably slower. For example, without
          cookies, you will not be able to set personalized preferences or you
          may have difficulty downloading tablatures, watching videos or utilizing
          the Community Forums. Some of our web pages may contain electronic images
          (called "Clear GIFs", "Single-Pixel GIFs", or "Web Beacons") that allow us
          to count page views or to access cookies. In general, any electronic image
          viewed as part of a web page, including an ad banner, can act as a Clear
          GIF. Typically, though, Clear GIFs are very small (1-by-1 pixel size) files.
          They are often invisible on a web page, but their presence can be detected
          within many Internet browsers by setting your browser to view web page
          "sources". Clear GIFs are so small in order not to use valuable space on
          the computer screen that is better used to display helpful content.
          We may also include Clear GIFs in our email products in order to determine
          information about the opening and reading of such emails. In addition,
          some advertising networks that serve ads on our web site may occasionally
          use Clear GIFs within banner advertisements. Clear GIFs set by Ultimate-Guitar.com
          generally are not used to collect, gather, monitor, or share personal information
          about our users, though they can be used in conjunction with cookies to record
          particular actions. We use Clear GIFs primarily to compile aggregated, anonymous
          statistics about web site or email product usage.</p>

          that appear on our web site(s) are delivered to you by Internet
