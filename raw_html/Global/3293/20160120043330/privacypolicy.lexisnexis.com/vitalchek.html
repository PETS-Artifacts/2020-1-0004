      <h1><em>Online Privacy Policy</em></h1>
      <em>(Last updated 12/17/2010)</em>
      <p>To underscore our commitment to privacy and our vision that good privacy is good business, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy for www.vitalchek.com and www.vcwebplus.com which are operated by LexisNexis VitalChek Network Inc. ("LexisNexis"), 1000 Alderman Drive, Alpharetta, GA, 30005. This site is not directed at children under the age of 13.
      <p>To demonstrate our further commitment to online privacy, LexisNexis Risk Solutions, Inc,. is a licensee of the TRUSTe&reg; Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. We have disclosed the information practices of our web site to TRUSTe, and TRUSTe has reviewed and approved this Online Privacy Policy for compliance with TRUSTe's online privacy standards.</p>
      <h5>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h5>
      <p><strong>I. Personally-Identifiable Information</strong></p>
      <p>This site only collects personally identifiable information (&quot;PII&quot;) from you if you choose to provide this information to us. Personally identifiable information collected with your consent may include, for example, name, mailing and credit card billing address(es), telephone number, e-mail address, social security number, driver's license number, date and place of birth or other vital event, credit card number, demographic information such as gender or ethnicity, information about parents or spouses which may be associated with a vital event, marital statuses, any response you provide to survey questions, information relating to any orders you place, or any inquires you may make through our web site. We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
      <p><strong>II. Cookies</strong></p>
      <p>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. This site uses cookies to determine whether a visitor is unique or whether the visitor has viewed our site before. Our purchase process also uses cookies. This information allows us to recognize you as a customer, along with your account information. Very simply, this useful tool keeps you, our customer, from having to retype information that you've already entered. While most browsers are set to accept cookies by default, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you before accepting them. Your browser manufacturer has information on changing the default setting for your specific browser. Failure to accept cookies may limit your ability to place orders through our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any PII you submit while on our site.</p>
      <p><strong>III. Nonpersonally-identifiable information</strong></p>
      <p>This site also collects nonpersonally-identifiable information. For example, as you browse this web site we may collect information about your visit, but not about you personally. Via Web server logs, for example, we may monitor statistics such as: the number of people that visit our site, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Apple Safari, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.). Our web site uses outsourcing programs to assist us in analyzing this data to better tailor our web site.</p>
      <h5>INFORMATION USE AND CONSUMER CHOICE</h5>
      <p>The information collected by this web site is used only for responding to your inquiries and otherwise corresponding with you, for processing transactions you request, maintaining your account, (if you have one), and for the administration, review and/or the improvement the content of our web sites. We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes. </p>
      <p>We may contact you in response to your comments or inquiries, as part of the maintenance of your account or on-line request or in order to complete a transaction that you requested.</p>
      <p>We also may contact you to inform you of other products and services we think may be of interest to you, but we always offer you an opportunity to opt not to receive such communications.</p>
      <p>If you decide that you do not want to receive further e-mails regarding your inquiry from LexisNexis, you can reply to the e-mail or use the opt-out mechanism provided in the e-mail. We do not use outside data to enrich marketing data obtained online.</p>
      <h5>ONWARD TRANSFER</h5>
      <p>We may disclose information you provide to us to third parties (such as government agencies and credit card processors) in order to complete a transaction that you requested. If, for example, you pay for a transaction using a credit card, disclosing that information for processing purposes is necessary to complete the transaction. In other cases, it may be necessary to disclose information you provide about yourself or third parties (government agencies) in order to obtain the certificate you requested.</p>
      <p>We may also outsource some tasks, including the operation of some website functions that require access to information you supply online. In such cases, however, we require that the companies acting on our behalf abide by our privacy policy and institute safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your information.</p>
      <p>If our company or our assets are acquired by another company, that company will assume responsibility for the personal information collected by us through this web site and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding the information collected through this web site, as described in this Online Privacy Policy. </p>
      <p>Finally, please note that we may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform with the law or to comply with a legal process. </p>
      <h5>ACCESS AND CORRECTION</h5>
      <p>As an information company, we know the importance of accurate data. Therefore, we strive to maintain the accuracy of the information collected through this Web site. Upon proper identification, we will provide you (whether you are a consumer or a customer) with access to personally-identifiable information you provide through this Web site for as long as we maintain that information in a readily accessible format. Similarly, we permit and encourage you to correct inaccuracies in the information you submit to us through this Web site. Please note, however, that correction of information is not always possible. For example, once you submit an order for a vital record, that order cannot be corrected. If you identify an error after you submit a request, you will need to place a new order if you wish to correct the information because vital record order requests often are transmitted to the relevant government agency in real time.</p>
      <p>If you wish to access information that you have submitted through this web site or to request the correction of any inaccurate information you have submitted through this site, please use the mechanisms provided by the site or send an e-mail to: <a href="mailto:Privacy.Information.Mgr@lexisnexis.com.">Privacy.Information.Mgr@lexisnexis.com</a>.</p>
      <p>The access and correction provisions of this online privacy policy only apply to PII collected from you through this web site. Individuals that are interested in information about how to access and/or request the correction of personal information LexisNexis companies maintain about them (such as public record information, insurance claims information, or information for employment background screening) for potential inclusion in information products and services can visit <a href="http://personalreports.lexisnexis.com" target="_blank">http://personalreports.lexisnexis.com</a> or <a href="http://www.lexisnexis.com/privacy" target="_blank">www.lexisnexis.com/privacy</a>.</p>
      <h5>SECURITY</h5>
      <p>We take steps to protect against the loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration of PII collected through this web site. We recognize the importance of security for all PII collected by our web site. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers.</p>
      <p>Once we receive PII, we take steps to protect its security on our systems. In the event we request or transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information or Social Security Numbers, we use industry standard, secure socket layer (&ldquo;SSL&rdquo;) encryption.</p>
      <h5>OTHER WEB SITES</h5>
      <p>This Online Privacy Policy only applies to the web site(s) identified in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy. Our web site, however, may include links to other web sites which may be operated by other LexisNexis companies or by third parties. If you visit a web site not listed above, we recommend that you review the online privacy policy of that web site to determine how the operator of that web site will handle personal information collected through that web site.</p>
      <h5>POLICY CHANGES</h5>
      <p>We may revise this Online Privacy Policy from time to time. If LexisNexis makes any material changes to this Online Privacy Policy, the date of the most recent revision will be indicated above so that you can determine whether there have been any material revisions since your last visit. If we are going to use your PII in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.</p>
