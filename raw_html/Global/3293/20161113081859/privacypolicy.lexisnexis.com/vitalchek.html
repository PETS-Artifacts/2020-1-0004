  <a name="access" id="access"></a><strong>7. Access to and Accuracy of Your  Personal Information</strong><br />
      The Service may allow registered users to directly access  their account information and make corrections or updates upon login at any  time. The accuracy of such information is solely the responsibility of the  user.</p>
<p>You also may request access to other personal information  about you that you have provided to us through the Service.

For instance, information you provide for making a payment to a government  agency or requesting a vital record may be transmitted to the appropriate  government agency in real time rather than being stored, and therefore not  readily accessible for review or correction. We will respond to your access or  deletion request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we may require you to  verify your identity. The personal information you directly provide us for the  purposes of verifying your identity is typically not stored, but transmitted to  the appropriate government agency directly to process your request, and  therefore not readily accessible for review or correction. <br />
        We will retain your information for as long as your account  is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your  information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve  disputes, and enforce our agreements and for other legitimate business purposes.<br />
