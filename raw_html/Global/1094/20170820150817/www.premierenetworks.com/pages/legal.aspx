                                                    <p>iHeartMedia provides three types of music streaming services:  (1) the “Free-of-Charge Service”; (2) the “Plus Service”; and (3) the “All Access Service”. The following terms are applicable only if you purchase the Plus Service or the All Access Service (each, a “Paid Subscription Service”). In order to obtain access to the Paid Subscription Service, you must also pay a specified subscription fee.  Further details about the Paid Subscription Service can be found at <a href="http://iheartradioondemand.com/" target="_blank">http://iheartradioondemand.com</a>. iHeartMedia may, at its sole discretion, change the features and services offered in any of the Paid Subscription Service at any time. The Paid Subscription Services are available to US residents only.</p>
                                                    <h5>Paid Subscription Service—Billing and Fees</h5>
                                                    <p>Before you register for a Paid Subscription Service, iHeartMedia will provide notice of any charges.  By registering for a Paid Subscription Service (which includes “Direct Purchases” and “In-App Purchases,” as defined below), you agree to pay all fees and charges associated with the Paid Subscription Service on a timely basis and are responsible for any charges incurred by your account.  You warrant that the credit card information that you provide is correct and is your account.  We are not liable for any loss that you may incur as a result of someone else using your password or account, whether with or without your knowledge.</p>
                                                    <p>By registering for a Paid Subscription Service and providing your credit card information, you authorize us (in the case of a Direct Purchase) or the App Store Provider (in the case of an In-App Purchase) to charge your credit card for the Paid Subscription Service fee at the then-current rate and any additional charges (including late charges and applicable federal, state, or local taxes). </p>
                                                    <p>If you make an in-app purchase of the Paid Subscription Service (an “In-App Purchase”) via the applicable app store provider (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play, etc.) (an “App Store Provider”), then the App Store Provider will charge your account the applicable fees or charges.  Billing for In-App Purchases will be handled by the App Store Provider, according to their terms.</p>
                                                    <p>If you purchase a Paid Subscription Service directly from us (a “Direct Purchase”), we may use a third party that is not affiliated with us to process your payments as merchant of record (“Processor”).  You agree that this Processor is solely responsible for controlling, handling and processing your payments.  For Direct Purchases, you will receive a bill for the Paid Subscription Service fee based on the term of the subscription for which you registered.  For example, if you signed up for a monthly paid subscription, you will be billed one day after each month on the calendar day that corresponds with the commencement of your subscription.  If your payment date falls on a date that does not exist in that month (e.g., the 31st day of a month), we will bill your credit card on the last day of the applicable month.  However, you acknowledge that we reserve the right to change our billing methods effective upon notice to you.  You may visit your member account to update your credit card information, and you agree to maintain a valid credit card during the subscription term.  You are liable for any amounts that are unsettled and overdue.  We may deactivate your member account without notice if your payment is past due.  Any delinquent payments are due in full within thirty (30) days of the termination or cancellation of a Direct Purchase Paid Subscription Service.</p>
                                                    <h5>Paid Subscription Service - Promotional Trial</h5>
                                                    <p>iHeartMedia may offer a free or reduced price trial subscription of the Plus Service or the All Access Service for a specified trial period either without payment or with payment of a reduced fee (a “Trial”).  To initiate the Promotional Trial, you will be required to provide your credit card information, and you must cancel your subscription before the end of the Promotional Trial to avoid incurring standard-rate charges.</p>
                                                    <p>Unless otherwise specified, Trials are limited to a single Paid Subscription Service; you may not obtain more than a single Trial using the same account or credit card and if you have previously used the same account or credit card to obtain a Trial or Paid Subscription Service, then that card will immediately be charged applicable fee upon registration. iHeartMedia may, at its sole discretion and to the fullest extent permitted by law, revoke or alter a Promotional Trial without notice to you and at any time. Your Promotional Trial will end as soon as you purchase a Paid Subscription Service.</p>
                                                    <p>Upon expiration of your Promotional Trial, unless you cancel the Paid Subscription Service for which you registered, you acknowledge that you will be automatically enrolled in the Paid Subscription Service you selected during registration and your credit card will automatically be charged the applicable fees (including applicable federal, state, or local taxes) for that Paid Subscription Service.</p>
                                                    <h5>Paid Subscription Service—Automatic Renewal</h5>
                                                    <p>Your Paid Subscription Service will automatically renew unless you cancel your subscription before the end of your current subscription term.  Cancellation will be effective the day after the end of your current subscription term.  Your failure to cancel your subscription during the current term will result in the renewal of your subscription at the then-current subscription rate and for the same term as your current subscription (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly).  The cancellation of a Paid Subscription Service will result in a downgrade of your subscription service to the Free-of-Charge Service as of the end of your current subscription term.</p>
                                                    <h5>Paid Subscription Service—Subscription Rate Changes</h5>
                                                    <p>We may change the subscription rate from time to time.  If we do, we will provide you advance notice of any change in the subscription rate.  If you do not agree with the new subscription rate, you may cancel your subscription prior to the new subscription rate taking effect.  If you continue to use the Paid Subscription Service after the subscription rate has gone into effect, you will be charged the new rate until you cancel or the rate changes.</p>

If you purchase the Paid Subscription Service online, such information will be shared with Processor.  If you make an in-app purchase of the Paid Subscription Service, such information will be shared with the applicable app store provider (e.g.,  Apple App Store, Google Play, etc.).  Your data will be handled in accordance with our Privacy Policy.</p>

If the Paid Subscription Service does not recognize your device from a previous sign-in, you will be asked for information that will help us to identify your registration.  It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your password, if one is established.  You are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account, and agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

                                                    programs that use your information by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">NAI Opt-out page</a>. Please note that even if you choose to remove your information (opt out), you will still see advertisements while you're browsing online. However, the advertisements you see may be less relevant to you and your interests. Additionally, many network advertising programs allow you to view and manage the interest categories they have compiled from your online browsing activities. These interest categories help determine the types of targeted advertisements you may receive. The NAI Opt-Out Page provides a tool that identifies its member companies that have cookies on your browser and provides a mechanism to opt out of receiving cookies from those companies. Please note that if you opt-out of targeted advertising, we may still track your visits to the Platforms for our own analytics, operations and security purposes. Your browser may offer you a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and/or across different websites. Our Platforms do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we collect information about your online activity both while you are using the Platforms and after you leave our Platforms.
