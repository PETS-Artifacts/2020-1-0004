<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gameloft Inc. and its websites, games and other applications ("we," "our" or "us") believe that your privacy is very important. This Policy outlines the types of personally identifiable information and other data that we will collect from you through the various websites, games and applications we provide ("Websites/Apps"), and how we will use and when we might disclose such information and data to third parties. Your installation and/or use of these Websites/Apps and/or submission of information to us constitute your consent to this Privacy Policy and the processing of your information (personal and non-personal) as described in this Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 1, 2008 and was last modified on July 6, 2016.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>There are two types of information we may collect through your use of the Websites/Apps:</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>“<strong>Personal Information</strong>,” which is the type of information that specifically identifies you personally and/or can be used alone to contact you online or offline, such as your full name, physical address, email address, telephone number, photograph, precise geolocation information (i.e., your specific location), Gameloft player ID, credit card information and, in some cases, usernames; and</li>
  <li>&nbsp;“<strong>Non-Personal Information</strong>,” which is information that does not identify you and cannot be used to contact you personally, including information about you such as your date of birth, age, ZIP code, non-precise geolocation information (e.g., your city), and gender, as well as information about your computer and mobile device, such as your unique device ID, Internet Protocol (IP) address, or other persistent identifiers, and their hardware/software/firmware. Non-Personal Information also includes “<strong>Usage Data</strong>,” which is anonymous data tied to your computer and/or device, such as the actions you take within and outside of the Websites/Apps, the browser you use, the identity of other apps included on your device, the date and time of your use of the Websites/Apps, your game progress, play time, score and achievements, and the URLs you visited and/or apps you used before and after using our Websites/Apps.</li>
