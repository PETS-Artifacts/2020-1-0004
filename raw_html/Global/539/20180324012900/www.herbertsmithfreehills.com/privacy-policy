<h3>5. Disclosure of your information</h3>
<p>We own the database rights in the information collected via our online services. We do not trade in or rent out this information.</p>
<p>As an international legal practice, we may in providing our services and operating our business, allow our offices, branches, subsidiaries and associated firms and our service providers to access your information. </p>
<p>In addition, we may exchange your personal information with third parties where:</p>
<ul><li>You have consented to us sharing your personal information in this way;</li>
<li>We are under a legal, regulatory or professional obligation to do so (for example, in order to comply with anti-money laundering requirements) or in order to enforce or apply our Business Terms (or other client terms) or to protect the rights and interests, property, or safety of HSF, our clients or others;</li>
<li>All, or substantially all the assets of an entity within HSF are merged with or acquired by a third party, or we expand or re-organise our business, in which case your personal information may form part of the transferred or merged assets or we may need to transfer your information to new entities or third parties through which our business will be carried out;</li>
<li>It is relevant in the circumstances to disclose the information to our clients, your employer or place of business, your professional advisers and parties with whom we have co-promotional arrangements (such as jointly sponsored events);</li>
<li>We provide anonymous statistical information about users of our websites and related usage information to reputable third parties, including analytics and search engine providers; or</li>

While such third parties will often be subject to privacy and confidentiality obligations, you accept that where lawful such obligations may differ from and be less stringent than the requirements of the privacy laws of the jurisdiction of origin. In those cases we are not responsible for imposing the laws of the jurisdiction of origin, and you may not be able to seek redress under those laws.</p>
<p>Personal information shared between HSF offices will at all times be subject to the contractual obligations prescribed by the EU model contract clauses and the requirements in the Australian Privacy Principles. If you have any questions in relation to the transfer of your personal information outside the jurisdiction of origin please contact us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2151534857404258614952470f424e4c" rel="nofollow"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="89f9fbe0ffe8eaf0c9e1faefa7eae6e4">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>
