<p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request to enter into a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br />

<p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: necessary to perform a contract or to take steps at your request to enter into a contract (Article 6(1)(b) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br />
<strong>Reason why necessary to perform a contract</strong>: where you have entered into a contract or requested that we enter into a contract with you, in certain circumstances, we will obtain information about you from public sources in order to enable us to understand your business and provide services to you or services to a sufficient standard.</p>

<p>For example, we would obtain and/or verify your e-mail address from your website or from a directory where you ask us to send you information by e-mail but we do not possess the information or we need to confirm that we have recorded your e-mail address correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Legal basis for processing</strong>: our legitimate interests (Article 6(1)(f) of the General Data Protection Regulation).<br />
<strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: in certain circumstances, we will have a legitimate interest in obtaining information about you from public and private sources.
