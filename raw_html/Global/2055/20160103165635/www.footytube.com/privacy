      <p class="headline_med">Third-party Advertisers, Links to Other Site</p>
      <p><b>footy</b>tube allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the <b>footy</b>tube Site. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the <b>footy</b>tube Site.

The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the <b>footy</b>tube Site, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.</p>
