We comply with the relevant legal requirements and take all reasonable care to ensure that your information is secure and private and is only seen by responsible third parties.</p>

      <p>IP ADDRESSES AND COOKIES</p>
      <p>We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This is statistical data about our users&rsquo; browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.</p>
      <p>For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. They help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:</p>
      <p>To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.</p>

      <p>To recognise you when you return to our site.</p>
      <p>You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.</p>
      <p> Our digital editions are provided by a third-party company which places a third-party cookie on logging in to allow you to read them.</p>
      <p>Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control.</p>

      <p>WHERE WE STORE YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p>
      <p> The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (&lsquo;EEA&rsquo;). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
      <p>All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.</p>
      <p> Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.</p>
