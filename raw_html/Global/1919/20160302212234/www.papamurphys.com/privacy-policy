</ul>

<h2>Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms</h2>

<p>We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms, including tracking technologies designed for mobile apps, to track information about your use of our Website and our Mobile Application. We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you (and our third party service providers may do so on our behalf).</p>

<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive or your device through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Website and our Mobile Application, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>  

<ul>
	<li><u>·Session Cookies.</u> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li><br>
	<li><u>·Persistent Cookies.</u> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong><i>Disabling Cookies.</i></strong> Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you disable cookies on your web browser, you will be able to view our Website, but our ordering platform may not work properly.</p> 

<p><strong><i>Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.</i></strong> Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Website and our Mobile Application to, among other things, help us manage content, and compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.</p>

<p><strong>Do-Not-Track</strong></p>

<p>Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions at the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and the <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/">Digital Advertising Alliance</a> websites.</p>

<p><strong>Targeted Advertising and Ad Networks.</strong></p>

<p>We may send users targeted ads, based on their location and activities on the Website and our Mobile Application. We may also participate in third party ad networks and allow third parties to use cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies on the Website to collect usage information and display targeted ads on third party websites; these third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. If you use our Mobile Application, you also may receive banner ads.</p> 

<p>We use third parties such as network advertisers to assist us in displaying advertisements on third-party sites and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Website and Mobile Application.</p>

<p>You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by NAI members. You may contact Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by DAA member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by DAA members. Opting out of one or more NAI members or About Ad members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our web site or other web sites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAA’s web sites accessible by the above links.</p>

<p><strong>Third Party Analytics.</strong></p> 
<p>We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate use of our Website and, to the extent permitted, our Mobile Application. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services. We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.</p>

<p><strong>Third-Party Links.</strong></p> 
<p>We may provide links on our Website or through our Mobile Application to third party websites. Any access to and use of such linked websites is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third party websites. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third party websites.</p>

<p><strong>Security of My Personal Information.</strong></p> 
<p>We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.</p>
<p>You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, mobile device, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.</p>

<p><strong>Access To My Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>You may modify personal information that you have submitted by logging into your account and updating your profile information. Please note that copies of information that you have updated, modified or deleted may remain viewable in cached and archived pages of the Website or Mobile Application for a period of time.</p>

<p><strong>What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Information?</strong></p>
<p>We may send periodic promotional emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the e-mail. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any Services you have requested or received from us. You also may opt-out of the text messaging program by texting “STOP” at any time to 90421.</p>

<p><strong>Deactivation of Your Mobile Application Account</strong></p>
<p>At any time, you may remove the Mobile Application from your phone by following the instructions on your device. In addition, you may “deactivate” your use of the Mobile Application account by submitting a written request to papamurphys@rlvt.net. In your email please provide the email address and phone number (if applicable) that you used to sign up as well as the best email address where we can contact you.</p>
<p>Information collected by the Mobile Application is not deleted when you “deactivate” your account, and Papa Murphy’s and its service providers may retain access to the information that you submitted through the Mobile Application.</p> 

<p><strong>Children Under 13</strong></p>
<p>Our services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete such information from our systems.</p>
