<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;"><a name="informationcollect"></a>3. INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>

        </li>

In addition, if you connect a Third Party Service to the Services or enable functionality from the Services as part of your use of a Third Party Service, we may receive information from the provider of that Third Party Service about you or your use of the Services within that Third Party Service; such functionality may also perform actions on your behalf on the Third Party Service that are known to the Third Party Service or others. Even if you delete your account on a Third Party Service, we will retain any Information provided by that Third Party Service.

    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cookies (or browser cookies)</span>: A cookie is a small file placed on the hard drive of your computer. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Services.

        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Web Beacons</span>: Pages of the Services may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags and single-pixel gifs) that permit ASCAP, for example, to count Users who have visited those pages and/or for other related statistics (<em>e.g</em>., recording the popularity of certain content and verifying system and server integrity, <em>etc</em>.).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Local Storage</span>: Local storage is an industry standard method we may use to store and retrieve Information on a User&rsquo;s computer and/or Device (<em>e.g</em>., caching, HTML5, <em>etc</em>.) in a web browser. Your web browser may offer settings for you to control local storage options. Please see Section 6 below for more details. </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not collect Personal Information automatically; however, we may associate the Information obtained through these technologies with your Personal Information so we can, among other things, better customize your experience using the Services and/or the advertisements and promotions you see.

    </li>
</ul>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;"><a name="thirdparty"></a>4. THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING SERVICE PROVIDERS</h2>
<p>The Services may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Third Party Advertising Service Providers</span>") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Services, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Services. These Third Party Advertising Service Providers do not have access to any tracking technologies set by the Services except to the extent necessary to provide services to us in connection with the Services; <span style="text-decoration: underline;">however</span>, these Third Party Advertising Service Providers may use their own tracking technologies (as described above) to collect similar Information. ASCAP does not control these Third Party Advertising Service Providers and/or their use of tracking technologies, which is instead governed by the privacy policies of any such Third Party Advertising Service Provider. Please see <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Section 7</span> below for more information on how to opt-out of the collection and use of Information collected via certain automatic collection technologies.</p>
<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;"><a name="discloseinformation"></a>5. HOW WE MAY USE AND DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>

Additionally, we may also use the Information we collect from and about you as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>

Therefore, it is not clear whether the signals are intentionally transmitted by a User or whether a User is even aware of this. Despite current efforts, there is still disagreement amongst leading Internet standards organizations, industry groups, technology companies and regulators, concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals and no standard has been adopted to date. ASCAP takes privacy and security very seriously. With respect to &ldquo;do not track signals,&rdquo; we currently do not take action in response to these signals, but, if a standard is established and accepted, we may reassess how to respond to these signals.</p>
