                <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
                <p>OpenSignal Inc. respects your privacy. This policy explains the privacy practices of OpenSignal Inc. ("<b>OpenSignal</b>") on www.opensignal.com (the "<b>Website</b>") and with respect to OpenSignal's mobile application (the "<b>Application</b>") (collectively referred to as "<b>the Services</b>"). It describes how OpenSignal collects and uses your personal information and the rights and options available to you.</p>

                <p>This policy is incorporated in OpenSignalâ€™s Terms of Service (the "<b>Terms of Service</b>" or the "<b>Terms</b>").</p>

                <p><b>By surfing, logging or connecting to, accessing or using the Service, you acknowledge that the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy constitute a binding and enforceable legal contract between the Company and any person connecting to, accessing or using OpenSignal. </b></p>

                <p>In this policy, the term 'personal information' (or 'personally identifiable information') means any information that, with reasonable efforts, may be used to identify you, such as a first and last name, home address and email address.</p>

                <p><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE</b></p>
                <p>When you register with the Services, OpenSignal may ask you to provide certain contact and personal details, such as mobile device number and e-mail address. Bear in mind that false, incorrect, or out dated information may impair OpenSignal's ability to provide you with the Services and to contact you when necessary. </p>

                <p>Further information may be collected when OpenSignal exchange communications with you, for example, if you submit a request, contact OpenSignal's support team, or report a violation to the abuse team.</p>

                <p><b>PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE</b></p>

                <p>The Services are based on users' locations and submissions, including user submissions made to third party services (such as social networks) which interact with the Service upon such users' choice, all of which may include personal information. You may upload and share content, such as Speed Tests, with other users on social media. The content that you share over social media should be treated as neither private nor confidential and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when submitting information. At the very least you should demonstrate the same degree of caution as when publishing personal information by means other than the Internet and cellular services.

                OpenSignal may make certain content that you submit for posting, viewable to all Internet users.</p>

                <p>In any event (but except as detailed below with respect to information shared from your social network accounts according to your privacy settings for such social network accounts), your email address or mobile device number will not be visible to others through any reports or user posts that you share or upload.</p>

                <p><b>We, at OpenSignal, take great measures to provide you with the best experience you can have while using the Service; However, OpenSignal has no control over the conduct of any user, and disclaims all liability in this regard. Users are advised to carefully and thoroughly consider whether or not to make public or available any information and carefully examine all necessary details related to any communication with other users prior to any engagement or communication being made. </b></p>

                <p><b> Participating in any user's activities as a result, directly or indirectly, from using OpenSignal, is entirely at your own risk. OpenSignal is not a party to any agreement entered into between the users in any circumstances.  The user has the sole and ultimate responsibility regarding compliance with all laws, regulation or any other duty. We do not accept any liability for any loss, damage, cost or expense that you may suffer or incur as a result of or in connection with your participation in any activity or event initiated, held or conducted by a user or a third party nor in connection to any agreement between the users or third parties, including any activity or event related in any way, directly or indirectly, the Services or the use thereof. </p></b>

                <p><b>LOCATION BASED AND NETWORK DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION WE COLLECT</p></b>

                <p>When you use your mobile device with a copy of the Application installed, OpenSignal collects your location and network diagnostic information. OpenSignal uses that information to provide you and other users with the Services. OpenSignal may make use your location and/or network diagnostic information to create aggregated anonymous data and to use such data in accordance with this policy (please refer to use of aggregated information chapter hereunder). OpenSignal will make commercially reasonable efforts to permanently remove or obscure your identity from your location or network diagnostic information that is used for aggregated purposes. </p>

                <p><b> OPTING OUT OF LOCATION AND NETWORK DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION SERVICES BY UNINSTALLING THE APPLICATION OR CHANGING SETTINGS </p></b>

                <p>At all times you may uninstall the Application, by using the Application's uninstall option, or by using the programs removal feature of your operating system. Following the uninstallation process, OpenSignal will not be able to collect any further location or network diagnostic information from you.</p>

                <p>At all time you may change how much and how often information is shared by the Application by using the Applicationâ€™s internal settings. There is no obligation to share any network diagnostic or location information with us and all location and network diagnostic information shared with us is therefore with the consent of the user and governed by the terms of the aggregated information chapter hereunder. </p>

                <p><b>INTEGRATION WITH SOCIAL NETWORKS</b></p>

                <p>You may choose to share information between the Application and your social network account (such as Facebook). Through this option, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from social networks, transmitted and shared through the Services. Similarly, you may choose to have personal information and other content about you available from OpenSignal, including your location and submitted network information, transmitted to and shared through your social network account.</p>

                <p> The social network's use of information made available by OpenSignal is governed by that social network's privacy policy and controlled by the social network, not by this Policy or OpenSignal. </p>

                <p> When you connect to the social network account through the Services for the first time or otherwise make the Services interact with your social network account, you will be asked to permit the social network to share your personal information stored on such social network with the Services. We collect your information from your social networks account only in accordance with your privacy settings you have set up under your social networks accounts. Accordingly we only collect such information which you allowed the social network(s) to share with third parties (such as your name, email address, list of friends, profile picture, other information you make publicly available via the applicable social network and/or other information you authorize us to access by authorizing the social network to provide such information) subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such social network accounts.</p>
