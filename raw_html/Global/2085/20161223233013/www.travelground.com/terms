    <h2>Booking Terms and Conditions - South African Establishments</h2>
    
    <h4>Company information:</h4>
    <p>This agreement sets out the booking terms and conditions pertaining to the website available at http://www.travelground.com ("the TravelGround.com website" or "this website") owned and operated by TravelGround (Pty) Ltd. based in South Africa trading as TravelGround.com (registration number 2013/076256/07) (hereinafter referred to as "TravelGround.com") with members Jonathan Womersley, Justin Womersley, David McLennan and Marcel Van de Ghinste.</p>

    <h4>Acceptance of this agreement:</h4>
    <p>This agreement is valid, binding and enforceable against all persons who access this website or any part thereof. Please read this agreement carefully as by using this website you will be taken to have agreed to be bound by it. If you do not agree to be bound by the provisions of this agreement, you must leave the TravelGround.com website immediately as further use will automatically bind you to this agreement notwithstanding any disagreements by you to the terms of this policy.</p>

    <h4>Detailed description of goods and/or services:</h4>
    <p>TravelGround.com is a business in the South African tourism industry that markets accommodation online.</p>

    <h4>Delivery policy:</h4>
    <p>Subject to receipt of payment, requests for accommodation will be processed within one hour of receipt thereof and confirmed by way of an email to you containing a booking ID.</p>

    <h4>Cancellation and Refunds policy:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Each accommodation establishment on the TravelGround.com website has its own cancellation policy. This policy shall be viewable by you during the reservation process, and is legally binding.</li>
      <li>On receipt of a written instruction from you to cancel a reservation, any amount owed to you by the accommodation establishment in question, in terms of its cancellation policy, will be paid to TravelGround.com, whereafter we shall on-pay the received refund to you within 3 working days after our receipt thereof. Late cancellations will be subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant accommodation establishment's cancellation policy and TravelGround.com shall not be obliged to make any payments to you in the event that you are not entitled to a refund in terms of the terms and conditions of the relevant accommodation establishment's cancellation policy.</li>
      <li>Refunded payments are subject to an 8% handling fee on the deposit amount, which may be retained by TravelGround.com, subject to a minimum charge of R25.00.</li>
      <li>If a SWIFT transfer is necessary this will carry an additional R180.00 charge by TravelGround.com.</li>

    <h4>Double Bookings:</h4>
    <p>In the event that an accommodation establishment accepts more than one booking reservation for the same space of accommodation over the same period of time, and at least one of these reservations is booked through TravelGround.com, the accommodation establishment will be in breach of contract with TravelGround.com. In such an event, the accommodation establishment is required in terms of the contract between TravelGround.com and the accommodation establishment to offer suitable alternative accommodation to you. If the accommodation establishment fails to do so, then TravelGround.com will do so on its behalf, or refund you in full. The aforesaid contract between TravelGround.com and the accommodation establishment stipulates that the relevant accommodation establishment shall be liable for a severe penalty where it accepts more than one booking reservation for the same space of accommodation over the same period of time. These penalties are significant enough to ensure that such breach of contract by accommodation establishments does not occur regularly.</p>

    <h4>Credit card acquiring and security:</h4>
    <p>Save as otherwise provided for in this agreement, the rules, processes and procedures of PayGate (Pty) Ltd and the relevant paying bank, clearing bank and card association shall apply to all payments and transactions concluded on this website and your rights and obligations in respect of payments due to or by you shall be governed accordingly.

    </ul>

    <h4>Country of domicile:</h4>
