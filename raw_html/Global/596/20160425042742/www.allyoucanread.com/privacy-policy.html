  <p>AMIXIMA Corp (&quot;AMIXIMA&quot;) recognizes the importance

    AMIXIMA include in AllYouCanRead.com any functionality 
    for performing &quot;reverse searches&quot; to identify 
    AllYouCanRead.com users from their e-mail addresses. However, 
    AMIXIMA reserves the right to analyze and utilize user 
    data in order to more effectively optimize the user experience 
    and to present certain opportunities to users for their 
    benefit. AMIXIMA also reserves the right to share with 
    its partners and third parties some personal information 
    on the aggregate basis only and provided that such use

    of privacy of or agreement with any AllYouCanRead.com 
    user. AMIXIMA's intent is to balance its legitimate business 
    interests in collecting and using personal information 
    against the reasonable expectations of privacy of its 
    users.</p>
  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <strong>Information Collection</strong>
    <p>AMIXIMA is the sole owner of the information collected 
    on AllYouCanRead.com. AMIXIMA collects information from 
    our users at following points on our Web site.    
    <p>      <strong>Registration</strong><br />
      In order to customize AllYouCanRead site, a user must 
      first complete the registration form. During registration 
      a user is required to give contact information (such 
      as email address). We do not collect user's name and 
      address. We use this information to contact the user 
      about services on our site for which he has expressed 
      interest. It is also required for the user to provide 
      demographic information (such as age group, gender, 
      city and country), and unique identifiers (such as, 
      username and password).</p>
   
      <strong>Information Use</strong>
        <p>AMIXIMA uses personal information for: developing enhancements 
        to AllYouCanRead.com; marketing and promotional purposes; 
        and evaluating AllYouCanRead.com usage by analyzing and 
        otherwise using personal information and related data 
        in the aggregate, but not with respect to any individual 
        AllYouCanRead.com user.In addition, AMIXIMA uses personal information to direct 
        e-mail to AllYouCanRead.com users who provide their e-mail 
        address in connection with specific promotions, or to 
        direct e-mail regarding AllYouCanRead.com updates and 
        service enhancements to users who opt in during the AllYouCanRed.com 
        registration process.</p>
      <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br />
        A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer 
        tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie 
        is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information 
        while on our site. We currently do not use cookies on 
        our site. Some of our business partners use cookies on 
        our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have 
        no access to or control over these cookies, once we have 
        given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. 
        This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by AllYouCanRead.com 
        only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. </font></p>
      <p><strong>Log Files</strong><br />
         Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. 
        This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser 
        type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit 
        pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks 
        to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement 
        in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information 
        for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to 
        personally identifiable information. We use a tracking 
        utility called Webtrends that uses log files to analyze 
        user movement.</p>
      <h2>Sharing</h2>
  <p><strong>Aggregate Information</strong> (non-personally identifiable)<br />
    AMIXIMA shares aggregated demographic information 
    with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked 
    to any personally identifiable information.</p>
  <p><strong>Third Party Advertising</strong><br />
    We use third-party advertising 
    companies to serve ads when you visit our site. These 
    companies may use information (not including your name, 
    address, email address or telephone number) about your 
    visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide 
    advertisements on this site and other sites about goods 
    and services that may be of interest to you. </p>
  <p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong><br />
    In the course of serving advertisements to this site, 
    our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique 
    &quot;cookie&quot; on your browser.These are the instances in which we will share users' 
    personal information:</p>
  <p><strong>Legal Disclaimer</strong><br />
    Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, 
    we may need to disclose personal information when required 
    by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action 
    is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, 
    a court order or legal process served on our web site.</p>
  <p><strong>Business Transitions</strong><br />
    In the event AMIXIMA goes through a business transition, 
    such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or 
    selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information 
    will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 
    Users will be notified via email or prominent notice on 
    our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership 
    or control of their personal information. If as a result 
    of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable 
    information will be used in a manner different from that 
    stated at the time of collection they will be given choice 
    consistent with our notification of changes section.</p>
  <h2>Choice/Opt-out</h2>
  <p>Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of 
    having their information used for purposes not directly 
    related to our site at the point where we ask for information.Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and 
    promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these 
    communications by offering an opt-out mechanism on the 
    &quot;My News&quot; pages or contacting us at: <b>allyoucanread[AT]amixima[DOT]com</b>.Users of AllYouCanRead.com are always notified when their 
    information is being collected by any outside parties. 
    We do this so our users can make an informed choice as 
    to whether or not they should proceed with services that 
    require an outside party.</font></p>
  <h2>Links</h2>
  <p>
    This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be 
    aware that we, AMIXIMA, are not responsible for the privacy 
    practices of such other sites. We encourage our users 
    to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy 
    statements of each and every Web site that collects personally 
    identifiable information. This privacy statement applies 
    solely to information collected by this Web site. </font></p>
  
 <h2> Security</h2>
  <p>
    AMIXIMA takes every precaution to protect our users' information. 
    When users submit sensitive information via the web site, 
    their information is protected both online and off-line.When our registration/order form asks users to enter 
    sensitive information (such as credit card number), that 
    information is encrypted and is protected with the best 
    encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a 
    secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on 
    the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator 
    and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed 
    to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'. 
    While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information 
    online, we also do everything in our power to protect 
    user-information off-line. All of our users' information, 
    not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is 
    restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the 
    information to perform a specific job (for example, our 
    billing clerk or a customer service representative) are 
    granted access to personally identifiable information. 
    Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our 
    security and privacy practices. Every time new policies 
    are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded 
    about the importance we place on privacy, and what they 
    can do to ensure our users' information is protected. <br />
    </p>
  <p>If users have any questions about the security at our 
    Web site, users can send an email to:<strong> allyoucanread[AT]amixima[DOT]com</strong>.</p>
  <h2>Correcting / Updating / Deleting / Deactivating Personal Information</h2>
    <p>If a user's personally identifiable information changes 
    (such as  email or country), or if a user no longer desires 
    our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate 
    users' personally identifiable information. This can usually 
    be done at the member information page or by emailing 
    our Customer Support at: <b>allyoucanread[AT]amixima[DOT]com</b> .</p>
    <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
  <p>
    If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post 
    those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, 
    and other places we deem appropriate so our users are 
    always aware of what information we collect, how we use 
    it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose 
    it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy 
    policy under which the information was collected. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable 
    information in a manner different from that stated at 
    the time of collection we will notify users via email. 
    Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their 
    information in this different manner. However, if users 
    have opted out of all communication with the site, or 
    deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not 
    be contacted, nor will their personal information be used 
    in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material 
    changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user 
    information already stored in our database, we will post 
    a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of 
    the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will 
    also email users, who have opted to receive communications 
    from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy 
    practices.</p>
  <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our 
    privacy policy, please contact us at: <STRONG>allyoucanread[AT]amixima[DOT]com.</STRONG>
