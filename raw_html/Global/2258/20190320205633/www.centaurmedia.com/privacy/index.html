<p>Specifically, we&rsquo;ve set out in this Privacy Policy the purposes for which we process your personal data and the lawful basis on which we carry out such processing.</p>
<p>The personal information we collect allows us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>provide the products and services you have ordered or signed-up to (necessary for a contract);</li>

<li>personalise your experience of our website, products, services and events, for example, by displaying targeted advertising and content which we believe likely to be relevant and of interest to you (please see below for further details) (legitimate interests, of our advertising partners, so that they can show you the most appropriate adverts); and</li>
<li>provide you with the prize for competitions you enter and win (necessary for a contract) and to comply with regulatory requirements to disclose a competition&nbsp; winner&rsquo;s name and county (necessary to comply with our legal obligations).</li>
</ul><p><u>Marketing Communications</u></p>
<p>Where we have told you that we will do so (such as during the registration process to our websites/website services and events (as applicable)) we may from time to time contact you by email, SMS, telephone or post about our products and services (including from all our brands within our business) that may be of interest to you (legitimate interests, of us, to promote our products and services, and of our customers, to keep them up to date with promotions, events and subscriptions which may be relevant to their professions and job roles). Further information about such marketing is below.</p>
<p><strong>From the brand with whose website or event you registered: </strong>We will also use your personal information to send you business-to-business marketing about products, services and events of the brand with whose website or event you have registered.</p>
<p><strong>From other brands within our business: </strong>We may also send you business-to-business marketing about products, services and events of other brands within our business which we think may be of interest to you.</p>
<p><strong>Third party marketing</strong>: We may share your registration information (including name, job title and contact details) with third parties for marketing purposes, but we will only do this where you have provided consent for us to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Opting-out: </strong>Our customers always have the right to let us know that they no longer want to be contacted for marketing purposes. If at any point you would like to opt-out of receiving such marketing communications from us, or would like to change the channels that we use to contact you, please click on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any emails you receive, or email us, stating your preferences, at <a href="mailto:preferences@centaurmedia.com">preferences@centaurmedia.com</a></p>
<p><u>Other ways in which we use and share your personal information</u></p>
<p><strong>Group companies</strong>: We may share your personal information with other companies in the Centaur Media group for the above purposes (legitimate interests, of us, for internal efficiencies).</p>
<p><strong>Events (including awards)</strong>: Where you are attending an event organised by us we may share your name, job title and company with the other attendees of the event (including making this information available via the event app, on social media sites and/or in our event guide). Generally we will ask for your consent to share this information, but for some of our events, such as our awards and round table events (and any other events which we inform you of) we rely on legitimate interests to share this information because it is a fundamental part of such events (for example, for table plans and networking purposes).</p>
<p>If you enter one of our awards and are short-listed, your name and organisation details will be included in the award lists and materials used and distributed in relation to the award (legitimate interests, of us and other entrants and attendees of the awards, to allow other entrants and those attending the awards to see who is in the running).</p>
<p>We will share your registration information with the sponsors of our events who may contact you for marketing purposes (legitimate interests, of us, to attract the most appropriate sponsors for the event and of our sponsors, to facilitate business-to-business communications between them and our registrants before, during and after our events). We or our sponsors may contact you ahead of our events to enquire whether you&rsquo;d like to set up a meeting with our sponsors at the relevant event.</p>
<p>Where you register to attend certain seminars or presentations at our events hosted by a third party, we may share your registration information with such third party (legitimate interests, of our hosts, so they know who has attended their events and so they can contact attendees about their goods and services).</p>
<p>Where you indicate that you want us to share your details with exhibitors at events (for example, by scanning your event badge at an exhibitor&rsquo;s stand) we share your information with those exhibitors who may contact you about their goods and services (consent).</p>
<p><strong>Event filming and photography: </strong>We process your personal data comprised in the film, photograph, broadcast or recording of the event so that we have a record of our events for our own internal purposes such as training (legitimate interests, of us, to train our staff and help us better understand how best to run future events), to create marketing content for our promotion of future events (legitimate interests, of us, to encourage future sponsorship, attendance and awards entries), to supplement editorial content on an event (legitimate interests, of us, to provide fuller and more engaging content). We may also share this with future sponsors (legitimate interests, of us, to show potential sponsors what the event is like and to encourage sponsorship) and existing sponsors and clients (legitimate interests, of us and our sponsors and clients, to share potential marketing material with our sponsors and clients so that they can promote their involvement in the event).</p>
<p><strong>Sponsored webinars and whitepapers: </strong>Where you sign up for a sponsored webinar or to access sponsored content such as whitepapers, we share your sign-up details with that sponsor who may contact you (legitimate interests, of us, to enable us to offer our users premium business content free of charge, and of our sponsors, to facilitate business-to-business relationships). If you do not wish for your details to be shared we usually offer an alternative means of accessing this content.</p>
<p><strong>Job sites:</strong> Where you apply for a job via one of our websites we share your application with the recruiter/employer advertising that job (consent). Where you indicate that you are happy for your CV and contact details to be made available to all other recruiters who have signed up to use our job websites, we share that information with them (consent). If you no longer want to make your CV and contact details available to all recruiters you can contact us at <a href="mailto:preferences@centaurmedia.com">preferences@centaurmedia.com</a> or edit your account settings, but please note that recruiters who have already been given access to your CV prior to you changing your preferences may still contact you.</p>
<p><strong>You employer</strong>: Where your subscription to our service is a part of a wider corporate subscription (i.e. your employer obtains a subscription for all of its employees) we may share information about your use of the service with your employer (legitimate interests, of your employer, so they can understand how their staff are making use of the resources they have purchased).</p>
<p><strong>Service providers</strong>: We may employ the services of third party service providers to help us in certain areas, such as website hosting, maintenance, call centre operation and the operation of events. In some cases the third party may receive your personal data (legitimate interests, of us, for service efficiency and to benefit from third party expertise, and our customers so they experience a good quality of service). However, at all times, we will control and be responsible for the use of your personal data and we will endeavour to ensure that our service providers are bound by contractual obligations to only process your personal data in accordance with our instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregate information</strong>: As mentioned above, we may use aggregated information so we can administer and improve our website, analyse trends and gather broad demographic information and detect suspicious or fraudulent transactions. We may pass this information to third parties. In most cases this information will be anonmyised, meaning that you will not be able to be identified from it.</p>
<p><strong>Online advertising</strong>: We may share some of your information with advertisers, ad servers and ad networks to deliver targeted advertising both on our websites and on selected partner websites but this will not include any information which directly identifies you (legitimate interests, for advertising purposes). However, by interacting with or viewing an advert, you should be aware that the third party may make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advert. These activities may involve the use of cookies and other similar technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please read our <a href="https://www.centaurmedia.com/cookies">Cookie Policy</a>&nbsp; for further information on the cookies we use and how you can enable/disable them.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys</strong>: If you complete a survey, unless we inform you otherwise, your answers will be aggregated and anonymised for research and analysis purposes. However, if you choose to provide any information in your response to a survey which identifies you (e.g. name, job title), we may be able to identify you from this. If you choose to submit your email address to enter into any prize associated with the survey, this will be used to administer the prize only and will not be linked to your survey responses (necessary for a contract). We may share your responses in an aggregated and anonmyised form with third parties carrying out research relating to the topics covered in the survey or, if the survey relates to your use of one of our subscription products, and this forms part of a corporate subscription taken out by your employer for you and other employees, we may share information provided in your survey responses about your use of the subscription with your employer (legitimate interests, for research purposes). If you have included information about yourself in your survey responses (e.g. name, job title), third parties or your employer (as appropriate) may be able to identify you from this.</p>
<p><strong>Administration of justice</strong>: We may occasionally be required by law, court order or governmental authority to disclose certain types of personal data (necessary to comply with a legal obligation, or for legitimate interests in connection with a legal claim against us).&nbsp; Examples of the type of situation where this would occur would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the administration of justice; or</li>
<li>where we have to defend ourselves legally.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Other: </strong></p>
<p>We process personal data about individuals who feature in our publications, content and products, including information we have researched from publically available sources (legitimate interests and for journalistic purposes).</p>
<p>We also use publically available sources to research prospective customers in order to send them marketing information about products and services relevant to them (legitimate interests, to grow our business).</p>
<p>If you are submitting personal data on behalf of another or are submitting personal data which may be used publicly on our products, you should only do so where you have the consent of the individual and it will be your responsibility to ensure that the individual is made aware of this Privacy Policy and our processing of their personal data.</p>
<h2 id="priva3-4-sale-of-the-business"><strong>4. Sale of the business</strong></h2>
<p>In the event that the business is sold or integrated with another business, your details will be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchaser&rsquo;s advisers and will be passed to the new owners of the business (legitimate interests) .</p>
<h2 id="priva3-5-fraud-prevention-and-automated-decision-making"><strong>5. Fraud prevention and automated decision-making</strong></h2>
<p>If you provide a credit or debit card, we may also use third parties to check the validity of the sort code, account number and card number you submit in order to prevent fraud as well as to process any transaction you attempt via our websites. Any decision to deny you services based on the validity of your card details will be made solely by automated means. If you are denied a service because of this automated decision-making you are entitled to request us to further investigate. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:customerdata@centaurmedia.com">customerdata@centaurmedia.com</a> where you have been denied access to a service based on your card details being declared invalid and you consider this to be in error.&nbsp; It may also be the case that you will need to contact your bank / payment provider.</p>
<p>If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when:</p>
<ul>
<li>checking details in applications for credit and credit related or other facilities;</li>
<li>managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities;</li>
<li>recovering debt;</li>
<li>checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; and</li>
<li>checking details of job applicants and employees.</li>

In addition, we and service providers processing personal data on our behalf, transfer personal data to servers outside the EEA including in the United States of America and India for storage purposes. These countries may not have equivalent data protection legislation to the UK.
