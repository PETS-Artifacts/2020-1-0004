				in order to provide the services to you, we may collect the following Personal Information from you:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Contact information such as your name, phone and fax numbers, address and email address; and</li>
					<li>Billing information such as the number, expiration date, card type and billing address of your credit card;</li>
					<li>Demographic information such as your job title, job description and company name and company type; and</li>
					<li>Profile data, including your username and password, details about your purchases and the Content that you license from us.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If you submit content to Shutterstock for licensing, you may be asked to provide the following information:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Contact information such as your name, phone number, primary address, and email address.</li>
				    <li>Shutterstock may verify this information by asking you to either: a) upload a scan of a government issued ID (which will be stored securely on our servers); or b) provide a credit card number. Your credit card number will be used solely for the purpose of verifying your name and address. The credit card number will not be stored.</li>
				    <li>Payment and contributor information including, but not limited to, payout method, payout email, desired display name, content focus, and information about your skill level process.</li>					
				</ul>
				<p>Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.</p>
				<p>As is true of most websites, when you use the Site, Shutterstock or third party subprocessors contracted by Shutterstock may also collect certain technical and routing information about your computer to facilitate your use of the Site and its services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. We use these environmental variables to facilitate and track your use of the Site and its services. Shutterstock also uses such environmental variables to measure traffic patterns on the Site. To better understand the needs of our visitors to the Site we may occasionally match such information with your Personal Information.</p>
				<p>In order to reduce errors in our database, authenticate our users, and prevent abuse of our system, we may on occasion supplement the Personal Information you submit to us with information from third-party sources. For example, we may supplement your contact information with address information provided by the U.S. Postal Service to qualify your information and prevent errors in our database. We may supplement the information that we collect directly from you with information stored in third-party databases, such as demographic information or company information in order to make it more likely that any marketing communications we send will be relevant and of interest to you. You may find a list of any third-party subprocessors that we use to process information <a href="http://marketing.rexfeatures.com/documents/Rex List of Subprocessors.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.</p>

                <h1>INFORMATION SHARING WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS / AGENTS</h1>
				<p>Shutterstock uses one or more outside credit card processing companies to bill you for our goods and services. To the best of our knowledge, these companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purpose.</p>
				<p>We also share Personal Information with certain companies that perform services on our behalf. We only share the Personal Information which is necessary for them to perform those services. We require any company with which we may share Personal Information to protect that data in a manner consistent with this policy and to limit the use of such Personal Information to the performance of services for Shutterstock. You may find a list of these third-party subprocessors <a href="http://marketing.rexfeatures.com/documents/Rex List of Subprocessors.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                <h1>CHOICE / OPT OUT</h1>
				<p>You may "opt out" of receiving Shutterstock's email updates, newsletters and/or partner emails by emailing <a href="mailto:privacy@shutterstock.com">privacy@shutterstock.com</a>. The choice to opt out of such communications is also generally available during the sign-up process.

In addition, we will still send you service-related announcements including, but not limited to, a registration email, benefit notification emails, emails automatically triggered by actions you took on the Site and bill related notices. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you wish not to receive them, you have the option of deactivating your account.</p>

				<h1>PROTECTION OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
				<p>The Personal Information that you provide in connection with the use of the Site is protected in several ways.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Access by you to your account profile is available through a password and unique customer ID selected by you. This password is encrypted. You should strive to use a strong, alpha-numeric password which you should not divulge to anyone.</li>
				    <li>Your Personal Information resides on secure servers that only selected Shutterstock personnel and contractors have access to via password.</li>
				    <li>Your Personal Information is encrypted whenever it is transmitted to Shutterstock.</li>
				    <li>When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using transport layer security technology.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We strive to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we take into account the sensitivity of the Personal Information we collect, process and store, and the current state of technology to use these measures protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
				<p>If you have any questions about security on our Web Sites, you can send email to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@shutterstock.com">privacy@shutterstock.com</a>.</p>

				<h1>COOKIE AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
				<p>The Site may automatically collect information as you browse, such as Internet Service Provider, browser type and version, operating system and device type, average time spent on our site(s), pages viewed, information accessed, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet and other relevant statistics. Such information is sometimes referred to as web analytics and/or clickstream data.</p>
				<p>We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, and provide site functionality.</p>
				<p>Technologies such as: cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by Shutterstock and our affiliates, analytics services and service to provide site features and functionality. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.</p>
				<ul>
				    <li>A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer when you visit a site. We may use session cookies, which terminate when a user closes his or her browser, and/or persistent cookies, which remain on the user's computer until manually deleted. Most web browsers can either alert you to the use of cookies or refuse to accept cookies entirely. If you do not want us to deploy cookies to your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a website tries to put a cookie on your computer. Rejecting cookies may affect your ability to use the Site.</li>
				    <li>We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests.

We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.</p>
				
				<h1>TRANSFERS OUTSIDE THE EEA</h1>
				<p>Where we use certain service providers or share information within the Shutterstock Group, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</p>
				
				<h1>CHANGES IN PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
				<p>Shutterstock reserves the right to amend the Privacy Policy from time to time at its sole discretion and will provide notice by email or on the home page of the Site when we make material changes to this Privacy Policy prior to the change becoming effective. If as the result of such changes, you want to alter the ways in which Shutterstock is allowed to use your Personal Information, you can do so by following the procedure described in the section entitled "Updating Your Personal Information and Privacy Preferences."</p>
				<p>You will be deemed to have been made aware of, and will be subject to, any material changes to the Privacy Policy after such notice has been posted with the following exception: If at the time you provide Personal Information to Shutterstock you are given the opportunity (as you currently are) to limit how such information will be used to communicate with you, either by Shutterstock or by third parties, Shutterstock will not change your preference in this regard without your express consent. However, if Shutterstock is acquired by or merged with another entity, Shutterstock may provide to such entity customer information that is related to that part of our business that was sold to or merged with the other entity without your consent, but Shutterstock will provide notice of such asset sales, acquisitions, or mergers on this Site.</p>
