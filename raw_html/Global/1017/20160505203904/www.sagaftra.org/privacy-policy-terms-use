Portions of this Privacy Policy pertain to the iActor online casting area of the Site and other functionality available only to SAG-AFTRA members in good standing</p>

You may be required to confirm this information from time to time. </li>
<li><strong>Traffic and Transaction Data</strong>. Our servers automatically recognize visitors’ domain names and IP addresses (the number assigned to computers on the Internet). Some limited personal information about you may also be collected in this process. The Site may also gather anonymous “traffic data” that does not personally identify you, but that data may be helpful for marketing purposes or for improving the services we offer.  In addition, we may use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site, or to display the content according to your preferences. Traffic and transaction information may also be shared with business partners and advertisers on an aggregate and anonymous basis.</li>
<li><strong> Cookies</strong>.From time to time, we may use the standard “cookies” feature of major browser applications that allows us to store a small piece of data on your computer about your visit to the Site. We do not set any personally identifiable information in cookies. For example, cookies help us learn which areas of our site are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience at our Site may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.  We may use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don’t have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site, or for other purposes.

<li><strong>Contact Data</strong>. SAG-AFTRA may collect your legal name, professional name, address, residence address, business contact information, representation and representation contact information, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other contact information.  This information may be used by SAG-AFTRA to communicate with you, including in regard to SAG-AFTRA business including financial matters or otherwise, and may be used by SAG-AFTRA for any purposes related to the business of SAG-AFTRA, including mergers, acquisitions and other business transactions, including any dealings with other organizations whether or not related to SAG-AFTRA. SAG-AFTRA may also disclose this information to affiliates or to third parties it has contracted with to perform certain services on its behalf or to administer certain member benefits. Additionally, some site features allow you to opt-in to share your contact information with third parties, such as with the SAG-Producers Pension &amp; Health Plan and/or the AFTRA Health &amp; Retirement Plan, or any successor benefit plan.</li>
<li><strong>Resume Data</strong>. On the iActor online casting area of the Site, you may enter resume data about yourself, such as your name, address, professional experience, representation, special skills and training, physical characteristics, portrayable age range, head shots, sound clips, video clips, contact and representation information and other data relevant to your potential employment as an actor (“Resume Data”).  Resume Data may also include data SAG-AFTRA enters automatically from your member records and you are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such information.  Your Resume Data will not be available for viewing by third parties until you register your iActor account and elect to make your Resume Data publicly viewable.  Please see the iActor Member Guide and Tutorial, as it may be updated from time to time (the “iActor Member Guide”), for more information on the types of data collected in the iActor portion of the Site.  Your Resume Data is specifically intended by you to be made available to third parties such as casting directors, producers, directors, agents and others and may be used by such parties to contact you and evaluate your potential employment.  You hereby authorize SAG-AFTRA to make all such disclosures of your Resume Data to third parties as contemplated in the iActor Member Guide and this Agreement.  SAG-AFTRA may disclose your Resume Data via the Internet, in published directories or by any other means.  Recipients will be required to agree that they may use such information only to contact you for legitimate employment opportunities and to keep such information confidential and secure, but SAG-AFTRA cannot make any guarantees of compliance by third parties and SAG-AFTRA will not be responsible in any manner should such parties fail to comply with their agreements with SAG-AFTRA, such as, for example, by publishing or re-distributing your Resume Data.   SAG-AFTRA is not responsible for ensuring the identity or motivations of such third parties and you release <br />SAG-AFTRA from any liability or responsibility for the actions or omissions by recipients of your Resume Data.  <br /><em><strong>NOTE:  Information you post on iActor portion of the Site is not private and may be accessed and viewed by others.  SAG-AFTRA is not responsible for how such information is used by third parties.  We recommend that you not disclose your home address, home telephone number or other personal information you may not want generally disclosed.  Consider posting the contact information for your agent or manager instead.  If you do not have an agent or manager, consider obtaining a post office box and an answering service.</strong></em></li>
<li><strong>Return Email Addresses</strong>. When you send email inquiries to SAG-AFTRA, your return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive. SAG-AFTRA does not use the return email address for any other purpose and does not share the return email address with any third party unless specifically authorized by you in the email inquiry. </li>
<li><strong>Surveys.</strong> SAG-AFTRA may periodically conduct surveys on the Site or engage others to conduct such surveys.  SAG-AFTRA encourages you to participate in these surveys because they provide SAG-AFTRA with important information that helps SAG-AFTRA to improve the types of services SAG-AFTRA offers and how SAG-AFTRA provides them.   Participation in SAG-AFTRA’s surveys is voluntary.  SAG-AFTRA may take the information SAG-AFTRA receives from individuals responding to these surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other visitors to the site to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information).  SAG-AFTRA may then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of SAG-AFTRA’s services, and to develop new services and products and for other SAG-AFTRA-related uses including but not limited to that this aggregated, non-personally identifying information may be shared with third parties.  SAG-AFTRA will take commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any parties SAG-AFTRA engages to conduct such surveys  agree that they may not use such information except to provide it to SAG-AFTRA and that they must keep such information confidential and secure but SAG-AFTRA does not guarantee that such parties will do any of the foregoing and SAG-AFTRA will not be responsible in any manner should such parties fail to comply with such agreement.  </li>
<li><strong>Credit Card Data</strong>. When you make payments by credit card online, SAG-AFTRA shall obtain your credit card and related information but such credit card and related information shall be used only to process your payment and shall not be retained by SAG-AFTRA.  SAG-AFTRA may use third party services to process your credit card transaction. </li>
<li><strong>Eligibility Information</strong>.

<li><strong>Unclaimed Residuals</strong>; Foreign Royalties. To access information about whether SAG-AFTRA is holding any unclaimed residuals or foreign royalties on your behalf, you will be required to post your first and last names.  This information will be used by SAG-AFTRA only for the limited purpose of providing your search results.
<p>SAG-AFTRA follows generally accepted industry standards to protect personal information submitted to SAG-AFTRA. We limit access to personal information about you to our employees and agents who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while SAG-AFTRA strives to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, SAG-AFTRA cannot guarantee its absolute security.  Further, SAG-AFTRA will not be liable for any inadvertent disclosure of any information by SAG-AFTRA or any other parties in any manner inconsistent with the provisions in such paragraphs. If you do not agree with the provisions of this privacy policy, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@sagaftra.org">privacy@sagaftra.org</a> and request that we remove your information from such uses. </p></li>

The use of any information you may provide to any other party or site, or the use of “cookie” technology by any other party or site, will be governed by the privacy policy and terms of use of the operator of the other site that you are visiting.  In some cases these other parties and sites may share the information that they collect about you with SAG-AFTRA.  If you have any doubts about the privacy or security of the information you are providing to another party or on another site or about the privacy policy and terms of use of such other parties or sites, SAG-AFTRA recommends that you contact that other party and site directly for more information and review their privacy policy and terms of use. SAG-AFTRA is not now and never will be responsible for the actions of such other parties in any manner whatsoever, including but not limited to any violation of such privacy policies, terms of use or otherwise. SAG-AFTRA does not endorse any of these web sites, companies, organizations, or services or the content of any of these web sites. </li>

<h2>SAG-AFTRA PRIVACY POLICY IN REGARD TO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h2>
<p>This privacy policy in regard to children under the age of 13 (“Children’s Privacy Policy”) relates to the website at <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org">www.sagaftra.org</a> and all related domains - including sag.org, aftra.org, aftra.com, sag-aftra.com, and sagaftra.org – (collectively, the  “Site”).  The Site is provided by Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA,” or “ us”) located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600, ATTENTION: Legal Department/Website Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, email <a href="mailto:webmaster@sagaftra.org">webmaster@sagaftra.org</a> and the name of SAG-AFTRA’s agent is Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, General Counsel, located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600.  This Children’s Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="/privacy-policy-terms-use">Terms</a>.  Portions of this Children’s Privacy Policy pertain to the iActor online casting area of the Site (also accessible via <a href="http://www.iactor.org">www.iactor.org</a> and <a href="http://www.iactor.com">www.iactor.com</a>) and other functionality available only to Guild members in good standing.   </p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA encourages parents and legal guardians to become involved in the online activities of their children and to discuss the child’s use of the Internet and disclosure of information to any parties.  </p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, you must provide your parent’s or legal guardian’s email address or other contact information from which SAG-AFTRA may obtain your parent’s or legal guardian’s consent before you give out any information on the Site.  Please have your parent or guardian complete the <a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_policy_form.pdf">Consent of Parent or Guardian form</a> listed above and return it to us as instructed on the form.  </p>
<p>Although the Site is not directed at children under the age of 13, we recognize that some of our members are under the age of 13 and that they may want to participate in all of the benefits SAG-AFTRA offers via the Site.  Full participation in the Site requires the collection and submission of personally identifiable data.  Rather than restricting access to the Site to those 13 years of age or older, SAG-AFTRA has opted to make its on line services available to all of its members.  In doing so, SAG-AFTRA desires to comply with the requirements of The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which was established by Congress to protect children’s online privacy.  COPPA requires that Web site operators adhere to specific guidelines regarding the collection and handling of personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13. For more information about COPPA and your child’s rights to online privacy, visit the Children’s Privacy section of the FTC’s website <a href="http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/children%E2%80%99s-privacy">here</a>.</p>
<p>COPPA requires that website operators provide parents with certain information and obtain parental consent prior to permitting children under the age of 13 to access and use the Site. </p>
<ul><li><strong>A. What types of information do we collect about children? </strong>
<ol><li>Children can view content on the public portion of the Site without any personal information being collected. We do not collect personal information from children unless they register for an account to access the  sections of the Site requiring a login.</li>
<li>During our registration process we may collect a child’s first name and last name, parent's e-mail address, parent’s telephone number, child’s birth date, SAG-AFTRA member number, last four digits of the child’s social security number and password.  The child is also asked to provide a password hint, in the event the password is lost or forgotten.  We collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including children.  We may also collect a child’s e-mail address for the purpose of sending the child e-mail related to their activity with SAG-AFTRA and on the Site.  Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.</li>
<li>We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Sites.  These features may include job boards, instant message chatting, sending e-mail, posting and sending resumes, posting on message boards, interacting with third parties, and other similar activities. In the course of a child’s participation in these features, a child may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. We also allow registered users to update their contact information or other SAG-AFTRA records.</li>
<li>If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their child, the child will have access to and be able to use the iActor online casting area of the Site.  On iActor a child may enter resume data about himself or herself, such as name, address, professional experience, representation, special skills and training, physical characteristics, portrayable age range, head shots, sound clips, video clips, and other data relevant to his or her potential employment as an actor (“Resume Data”).  Resume Data may also include data SAG-AFTRA enters automatically from a child’s member records.  Please see the iActor Member Guide and Tutorial, as it may be updated from time to time (the “iActor Member Guide”), for more information on the types of data collected in the iActor portion of the Site.  We recommend that our members not disclose their home address, home telephone number or other personal information they may not want generally disclosed.  This is of particular concern in the case of children.  Consider posting the contact information for your child’s agent or manager or the parent’s office contact information, instead.  If you do not have an agent or manager, consider obtaining a post office box and an answering service.  </li>

</ol></li>
<li><strong>B. How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we have collected about children?</strong>
<ol><li>To personalize communications from SAG-AFTRA to a child (such as news and updates), we may use the child’s name and mailing address or email address. We may collect a child’s e-mail address in order to send communications relating to his or her membership in SAG-AFTRA.  SAG-AFTRA may, from time to time, contract with third parties to perform these communication services on its behalf and may disclose a child’s information to such third parties. In addition, personal information regarding a child may be disclosed in the course of a child’s participation in certain interactive features such as message boards.</li>
<li>Registered users are able to update their contact information of record with SAG-AFTRA. The information collected may include the child’s address(es), phone number(s), and email address(es). This includes the child’s primary contact information, the child’s billing address and the address to which the child wishes residuals to be sent.  The child may also opt-in to share the child’s contact information with the SAG-Producers Pension &amp; Health Plan and/or the AFTRA Health &amp; Retirement Plan, or any successor benefit plan. SAG-AFTRA may also, from time to time, disclose a child’s information to affiliates or to third parties it has contracted with to perform certain services on its behalf or to administer certain member benefits. For example, each year, SAG-AFTRA discloses members’ names and contact information, including such information pertaining to members under the age of 13, to its affiliate, Screen Actors Guild Awards, LLC, for purposes of allowing members to participate in activities related to and voting for the Screen Actors Guild Awards. Additionally, SAG-AFTRA may disclose, via its Actors to Locate Service, contact information for the child’s agent, if any, or the child’s business contact phone number. </li>
<li>In the course of administering claims under its industry agreements (for example, in collecting and distributing unpaid theatrical or television residuals), SAG-AFTRA may use and disclose information relating to the members affected thereby, regardless of the manner by which that information was collected. This may include information provided through the Site.</li>
<li>SAG-AFTRA allows its members to pay their membership dues through the Site. Through the Dues Online feature, SAG-AFTRA collects certain information necessary to complete the transaction, including a credit card number, expiration date and security code and the billing address associated with the card. This information is shared with the third party credit card processor and is used solely for the purposes of completing the authorized transaction.</li>
<li>The iActor portion of the site is intended to serve as a “job board.”  On the iActor portion of the site, Resume Data is specifically intended to be made available to third parties such as casting directors, producers, directors, agents and others and may be used by such parties to contact the child and evaluate his or her potential employment.  Such third parties can search and view Resume Data of participating Guild members and Guild members may communicate directly with such third parties, including transmission of resume data to them.  You hereby authorize SAG-AFTRA to make all such disclosures of the child’s Resume Data to third parties as stated above and contemplated in the iActor Member Guide.  Third parties will be required to agree that they may use such information only to contact the child or his or her representative for legitimate employment opportunities and to keep such information confidential and secure, but SAG-AFTRA cannot make any guarantees of compliance by third parties and SAG-AFTRA will not be responsible in any manner should such parties fail to comply with such agreement.   </li>
<li>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Policy, we do not share any information about a child with any affiliated entity or with any third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary: to comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Use or site rules; or to protect the safety and security of our guests and our Web sites.  <br /> </li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>C. How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collectionof information from a child?</strong> Before allowing a child to use a feature of our Web sites that might result in the disclosure of the child’s information to third parties on the Internet, we require the parent to <a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_policy_form.pdf">consent in writing</a> to this Children’s Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use and our more general Privacy Policy and to provide us with evidence confirming their identity, such as a copy of a valid driver’s license.  This information is retained by us as evidence that we received parental consent. </li>
<li><strong>D. How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their child ?</strong>
<ol><li>At any time parents can refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child and can request that any personal information we have collected be deleted from our records. We use two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their child.
<ul><li>(a)A parent can access, change, or delete his or her child’s personal information by logging on to the child’s account located at <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org/registration">SAGAFTRA.org</a>. The parent will need to have their child’s member name and password. If your child has forgotten the password, click on ‘Forgot Password?” link on the home page and follow the instructions</li>
<li>(b) A parent can contact our customer service department to access, change, or delete the personal information that we have collected from his or her child by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:webhelp@sagaftra.org">webhelp@sagaftra.org</a>.  Please include the child’s member name and the parent's e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request. </li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><strong>E. How will we notify parents if our Children’s Privacy Policy changes? <br /></strong>We may amend our Children’s Privacy Policy at any time. We will provide parents notice by e-mail of any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child’s personal information. Please note that, at all times, parents should update their personal information to provide us current e-mail addresses. We will apply material changes in our Children’s Privacy Policy only in conformance with applicable law, including any applicable provisions of COPPA that require parental consent.  <strong> </strong></li>

<h2><a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_policy_form.pdf">CONSENT OF PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN</a></h2>
<p>Certain features of the SAG-AFTRA web site require the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. An example is our iActor feature, an on line casting site which permits our members to post their resumes which will be searchable by casting directors, directors and others seeking to hire talent.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, state and federal law require website operators to implement certain protections prior to granting children access to interactive functions of the iActor website including. As part of those protections, website operators must obtain "verifiable parental consent" to the child's use of the website. In accordance with those protections, SAG-AFTRA policy is to lock children under the age of 13 out of the portions of our Site that permit the collection or submission of personally identifiable data until we receive your written consent. If your child is 13 or over but under 18 years of age, our policy is to provide him or her with provisional access for thirty (30) days at which time access will be suspended until such time as your child provides us with your written consent.</p>
<p>Accordingly, please review the <a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_policy_form.pdf">parental consent form</a> and <a href="/content/childrens-online-privacy-protection-act-coppa">full children's privacy policy</a>, <a href="/privacy-policy-terms-use">general privacy policy and terms of use </a>for the Site and determine if you will provide your consent to your child's participation in the Site. If you have any questions, you may contact our WebHelp department at (323) 549-6789.</p>
<p>Kindly complete, sign and date the <a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_policy_form.pdf">parental consent form</a> in the space provided and then either mail or fax it back to the SAG-AFTRA at the address or fax number provided. Please also include a copy of your current valid driver's license.</p>
<p>After SAG-AFTRA receives your letter, a SAG-AFTRA representative may call you to confirm your identity and status as the parent or legal guardian of the indicated child and that you signed the letter.</p>
