</ul><p>SAG-AFTRA is a non-profit, non-commercial organization and the Site is a non-commercial web site or online service.

<div id="terms"><center><br /><h2>SAGAFTRA.ORG TERMS OF USE</h2>
<p></p></center>
<p><strong>Contract between you and SAG-AFTRA</strong></p>
<p>By using our Site, you are agreeing to these Terms of Use (“Terms”) whether or not you registered with the Site. Please read these Terms carefully.</p>
<p>We may, from time to time, offer additional sites or services not covered by these Terms. Those additional sites or services may be covered by separate additional terms (“Additional Terms”), that will be posted on the section of the Site to which they apply. Those Additional Terms will take precedence if there is a conflict with any provision of these SAG-AFTRA Terms of Use. References to the “Terms” in these Online Policies include any Additional Terms applicable to sites or services you access or use.</p>
<p>We may update or change the Terms at any time. If we do, we may notify you of the changes by posting the new terms with an updated effective date. The most current version of the Terms will govern your use after the Effective Date. If you continue to use the Site after we post amended Terms, it means you agree to be bound by the changes.</p>
<p>In some sections, we have included a “non-legal” explanation of the section. This explanation is provided for your convenience and is not intended to limit or modify the effect of these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Your Information and Account</strong></p>
<p>Some sections of the Site require you to have a user account. User accounts are currently limited to SAG-AFTRA members and certain additional categories of entertainment industry professionals.</p>
<p>To create an account on this Site, you must be at least 18 years of age. If you are younger than 18, your parent or legal guardian must consent to these Terms, to our Privacy Policy and to your access to and use of the Site, as well as to the collection and use of your User Content (defined below), by completing and returning the parental consent form. If you are younger than 18 but over 13 years of age and are an emancipated minor you will be required to complete the consent form and provide evidence of your status as an emancipated minor. You may click <a href="/coppa">here</a> to access the required consent form.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Member-Only Access</span>. Some features on the Site are available only to SAG-AFTRA members in good standing or members who have opted in to certain specific programs or services. You may be denied access to these features if you do not meet the then-current conditions for access or use, including if you fail to timely pay your SAG-AFTRA dues or if you are no longer a member of SAG-AFTRA in good standing.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Contact Information</span>. If you have a user account, you are able to update certain contact information through the Site. It is important that you keep your contact information current and accurate.

We use this in connection with operating the site (such as making your iActor profile available or showing your name on a list of supporters for a campaign) and in connection with the services we provide as your union. You also affirm that you have the legal right to let us use the content you provide.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Public User Content</span>. Some information you post, such as your iActor profile, is not private and may be accessed and viewed by others. SAG-AFTRA is not responsible for how User Content is used by third parties. When using Site features that are visible to others, like iActor, we recommend you not disclose your home address, home telephone number, or other personal information you may not want generally disclosed.

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Opt-In Lists and Content</span>. You may have opportunities to opt in to various additional services, such as mailing lists for certain union campaigns or initiatives, supporter lists to show your support for union campaigns or initiatives, or user-generated content, such as testimonials, photographs, or videos. Additional terms may apply to these opportunities and will be indicated at the time of submission.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inappropriate Content</span><strong>.</strong> You agree that your User Content will not (a) be libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, threatening, or otherwise inappropriate; (b) advocate or encourage conduct that could be a criminal offense, create civil liability, or otherwise violate any applicable federal, state, local or foreign law or regulation; (c) advertise or otherwise solicit funds, goods, or services; or (d) infringe on the copyright, trademark, right of publicity or other intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p><em>In non-legal terms: If you post any content to our website, make sure you own it and that it doesn’t violate anyone’s rights or the law.</em></p>

We are not obligated to review or reject User Content and will not, as a regular matter, review, edit, censor, or otherwise maintain any supervisory role with regard to users’ activities or materials. We can remove User Content we believe is inappropriate or that otherwise violates these Terms or any SAG-AFTRA policy.</p>
<p><em>In non-legal terms: We can see the content you provide but we don’t regularly review it. If we do find out you are posting inappropriate content, we can remove it.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Copies and Disclosures</span>. We have the right to store and make copies of User Content and to make some or all User Content available to others, subject to these Terms, any Additional Terms, and our privacy policy [insert link]. We have the right, but not the obligation, to disclose User Content if we believe disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with law or legal process; (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that User Content violates the rights of other parties; or (d) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of SAG-AFTRA, its members, representatives, agents, Site users, or the public.</p>

<p><strong>Online Cast Clearance (Station 12) </strong></p>
<p>An online work clearance system is accessible to certain registered users involved in the casting and hiring of SAG-AFTRA-represented talent. By accessing the system, you represent and warrant that you will use it only to clear talent you have hired for a SAG-AFTRA-covered project. You may not use this system to "pre-clear" multiple candidates for a role.</p>
<p><strong>iActor (for Casting Professionals)</strong></p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA may grant casting directors and other industry professionals involved in the casting function (“Casting Professionals”) access to the iActor online casting service to find talent for SAG-AFTRA signatory productions. Access will be granted for limited durations, in our discretion. This section relates to Casting Professionals’ use of iActor.</p>
<p>You agree that your use of iActor and any information SAG-AFTRA members have provided through the iActor service (“Member Information”) will be only for the limited purpose of finding and contacting SAG-AFTRA members and/or their representatives for legitimate offers of employment in SAG-AFTRA -signatory productions and for no other purpose.

<p><strong>Sign Online / Online Signatory Application (for Producers)</strong></p>
<p>We offer an online signatory process that allows producers of certain types of production(s) to become signatory to a SAG-AFTRA contract (the "Signatory Site"). The Signatory Site requires the creation of a separate account (with a separate password) which is subject to these Terms as well as Additional Terms pertaining to the unique aspects of the Signatory Site.

<p><strong>Seek The Advice of Your Own Lawyer</strong></p>
<p>THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE SITE IS PROVIDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION PURPOSES ONLY AND IS NOT MEANT TO BE LEGAL, FINANCIAL OR OTHER ADVICE.

YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE OR REFRAIN FROM TAKING ACTION BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THE SITE.</p>
<p><em>In non-legal terms: We may provide information on the website that sounds like advice. Each person’s situation differs, so you should always consult your own advisors rather than relying on general information on the website.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Liability for Our Services</strong></p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SAG-AFTRA PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY DAMAGES OR COSTS OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR USE OF THE SITE OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY OR THROUGH THE SITE.</p>
<p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE SAG-AFTRA PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR:</p>
<ul><li>ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, COMPENSATORY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS,</li>
<li>PERSONAL INJURY OF ANY SORT,</li>
<li>COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, OR PATENT INFRINGEMENT, LIBEL, SLANDER, INVASION OF PRIVACY, INTERFERENCE WITH THE RIGHTS OF PUBLICITY, LOSS OF GOODWILL,</li>
<li>LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER OR DEVICE FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, BREACH OF CONTRACT,</li>
<li>WORK STOPPAGE, FAILURE TO PAY FOR SERVICES OR WORK, OR FAILURE TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO THE SITE FOR ANY PERIOD OF TIME.</li>
</ul><p>THIS LIMITATION WILL APPLY REGARDLESS OF THE FORESEEABILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR FORM OF ACTION.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THESE DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS MAY BE LIMITED BY THE LAWS OF CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS AND ARE APPLICABLE TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>
<p><em>In non-legal terms: Your use of the site is at your own risk and we cannot be held responsible financially for damages you incur through the site unless the law says otherwise.</em></p>
<p><strong>Disputes</strong></p>
<p><strong>If a dispute arises relating to the Site, we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or in small claims court instead of in a court of general jurisdiction</strong><strong>. Any arbitration under the Online Policies will take place on an individual basis<strong> and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action</strong> unless we both agree that it would be in the interest of justice to proceed with a class-wide claim.</strong> The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to the Online Policies.</p>
<p><strong>The arbitration process is less formal than a lawsuit in court. A neutral arbitrator will hear the case instead of a judge or jury. Discovery is more limited in arbitration and the arbitrator’s award is subject to very limited review by courts. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and the arbitrator will follow these </strong>Online Policies <strong>as a court would.</strong></p>
<p>To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to our General Counsel, Legal Department, SAG-AFTRA, 5757 Wilshire Blvd., 7th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, or if the Commercial Arbitration Rules are not applicable, such other rules as AAA may deem applicable, in effect as of the Effective Date of these Terms, utilizing its Expedited Procedures if the claim qualifies, or such other arbitration provider (utilizing rules substantially similar to the AAA rules) as we may mutually agree. The AAA's rules are available at <a href="http://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA rules. For claims totaling less than $10,000, we will pay or reimburse the AAA fees, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. We will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. The arbitration may be conducted by telephone, by videoconference, based on written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location.</p>
<p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration <strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial,</strong><strong> to the extent permitted by law.</strong> We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Regardless of where the claim is brought, the Online Policies are subject to and shall be interpreted under the laws of the state of California applicable to agreements wholly performed there, without regard to conflicts of laws rules, and the laws of the United States, where applicable. You agree to file any claim regarding any aspect of this Site or these Terms within two years of the time in which the events giving rise to such claim began, or you agree to waive such claim.</p>
<p><strong>SAG-AFTRA Transfer Right</strong></p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA may sell, assign, or otherwise transfer any or all of its rights in the Terms and the Online Policies, the User Content, or the Site to any other party.</p>
<p><strong>Miscellaneous</strong></p>
<p>The Site is provided by Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd., 7th Floor, Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600.

<p>The Terms are the complete understanding between you and SAG-AFTRA with respect to its subject matter.</p>
<p>A waiver of any provision of the Terms, or any claimed breach of these Terms, shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or breach. All remedies available to SAG-AFTRA in the Terms and under applicable law are cumulative and the exercise by SAG-AFTRA of any remedy shall be without prejudice to SAG-AFTRA’s exercise of any other rights or remedies available to SAG-AFTRA.</p>
<p>If any portion of the Terms is held invalid or unenforceable it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the rest of the Terms. All of the provisions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of the Terms for any reason.</p>
<p>You agree, except as expressly provided in these Terms, there shall be no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> The effective date for these Terms is February 9, 2017.</p>

<div id="under13"><center><br /><h2>SAG-AFTRA PRIVACY POLICY IN REGARD TO CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 13</h2>
<p></p></center>
<p>This privacy policy in regard to children under the age of 13 (“Children’s Privacy Policy”) relates to the website at <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org">www.sagaftra.org</a> and all related domains - including sag.org, aftra.org, aftra.com, sag-aftra.com, and sagaftra.org – (collectively, the  “Site”).  The Site is provided by Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (“SAG-AFTRA,” or “ us”) located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600, ATTENTION: Legal Department/Website Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, email <a href="mailto:sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org">sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org</a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">,</span> and the name of SAG-AFTRA’s agent is Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, General Counsel, located at 5757 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036-3600.  This Children’s Privacy Policy is incorporated by reference into the <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org/privacy-policy-terms-use">Terms</a>.  Portions of this Children’s Privacy Policy pertain to the iActor online casting area of the Site (also accessible via <a href="http://www.iactor.org">www.iactor.org</a> and <a href="http://www.iactor.com">www.iactor.com</a>) and other functionality available only to Guild members in good standing.   </p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA encourages parents and legal guardians to become involved in the online activities of their children and to discuss the child’s use of the Internet and disclosure of information to any parties.  </p>
<p>If you are under the age of 13, you must provide your parent’s or legal guardian’s email address or other contact information from which SAG-AFTRA may obtain your parent’s or legal guardian’s consent before you give out any information on the Site.  Please have your parent or guardian visit <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org/coppa">sagaftra.org/coppa</a> to fill out the parental consent form.  </p>
<p>Although the Site is not directed at children under the age of 13, we recognize that some of our members are under the age of 13 and that they may want to participate in all of the benefits SAG-AFTRA offers via the Site.  Full participation in the Site requires the collection and submission of personally identifiable data.  Rather than restricting access to the Site to those 13 years of age or older, SAG-AFTRA has opted to make its online services available to all of its members.  In doing so, SAG-AFTRA desires to comply with the requirements of The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which was established by Congress to protect children’s online privacy.  COPPA requires that Web site operators adhere to specific guidelines regarding the collection and handling of personally identifiable information about children under the age of 13. For more information about COPPA and your child’s rights to online privacy, visit the Children’s Privacy section of the FTC’s website <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/privacy-and-security/children%27s-privacy">here</a> (or you may visit FTC.gov and search “Children’s Privacy”).</p>
<p>COPPA requires that website operators provide parents with certain information and obtain parental consent prior to permitting children under the age of 13 to access and use the Site. </p>
<ul type="disc"><li><strong>A. What types of information do we collect about children? </strong></li>
</ul><ol type="1" start="1"><li>Children can view content on the public portion of the Site without any personal information being collected. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children unless they register for an account to access the sections of the Site requiring a login.</li>
<li>During our registration process we may collect a child’s first name and last name, parent's e-mail address, parent’s telephone number, child’s birth date, SAG-AFTRA member number, last four digits of the child’s social security number, member category, and password.  The child is also asked to provide a password hint, to be used in the event the password is lost or forgotten.  We may collect birth dates to validate the ages of our guests, including children.  We may also collect a child’s e-mail address for the purpose of sending the child e-mails related to their activity with SAG-AFTRA and on the Site.  Note that all sites that are directed to children under 13 are prohibited by law from conditioning a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.</li>
<li>We may collect personal information from parents in order to allow kids to participate in certain features located on our Sites.  These features may include job boards, instant message chatting, sending e-mail, posting and sending resumes, posting on message boards, submitting videos photographs or other testimonial content, interacting with third parties, and other similar activities. In the course of a child’s participation in these features, a child may also provide us additional information about himself or herself, such as the contents of his or her chat or message board postings. We also allow registered users to update their contact information or other SAG-AFTRA records.</li>
<li>If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their child, the child will have access to and be able to use the iActor online casting area of the Site.  On iActor a child may enter resume data about himself or herself, such as name, address, professional experience, representation, special skills and training, physical characteristics, portrayable age range, head shots, sound clips, video clips, and other data relevant to his or her potential employment as an actor (“Resume Data”).  Resume Data may also include data SAG-AFTRA enters automatically from a child’s member records.  We recommend that our members not disclose their home address, home telephone number, or other personal information they may not want generally disclosed.  This is of particular concern in the case of children.  Consider posting the contact information for your child’s agent or manager or the parent’s office contact information instead.  If you do not have an agent or manager, consider obtaining an alternate phone number and using a dedicated email address.  </li>
<li>If a parent allows us to collect personal information about their child, we will permit the child to access and use the iActor online casting area of the Site.  On iActor a child may enter resume data about himself or herself, such as name, address, professional experience, representation, special skills and training, physical characteristics, portrayable age range, head shots, sound clips, video clips, and other data relevant to his or her potential employment as an actor (“Resume Data”).  Resume Data may also include data SAG-AFTRA enters automatically from a child’s member records.  Please see the iActor Member Guide and Tutorial, as it may be updated from time to time (the “iActor Member Guide”), for more information on the types of data collected in the iActor portion of the Site.  We recommend that our members not disclose their home address, home telephone number, or other personal information they may not want generally disclosed.  This is of particular concern in the case of children.  Consider posting the contact information for your child’s agent or manager instead or the parent’s office contact information.  If you do not have an agent or manager, consider obtaining a post office box and an answering service. </li>
</ol><li><strong>B. How do we use and share the personally identifiable information that we have collected about children?</strong></li>
<ol type="1" start="1"><li>To personalize communications from SAG-AFTRA to a child (such as news and updates), we may use the child’s name and mailing address or email address. We may collect a child’s e-mail address in order to send communications relating to his or her membership in SAG-AFTRA.  SAG-AFTRA may, from time to time, contract with third parties to perform these communication services on its behalf and may disclose a child’s information to such third parties. In addition, personal information regarding a child may be disclosed in the course of a child’s participation in certain interactive features such as message boards.</li>
<li>Registered users are able to update their contact information of record with SAG-AFTRA. The information collected may include the child’s address(es), phone number(s), and email address(es). This includes the child’s primary contact information, the child’s billing address, and the address to which the child wishes residuals to be sent.  SAG-AFTRA may also, from time to time, share a child’s information with the SAG-AFTRA Health Plan, the SAG-Producers Pension Plan and/or the AFTRA Health &amp; Retirement Plan, or any successor benefit plan. SAG-AFTRA may also, from time to time, disclose a child’s information to affiliates or to third parties it has contracted with to perform certain services on its behalf or to administer certain member benefits. For example, each year, SAG-AFTRA discloses members’ names and contact information, including such information pertaining to members under the age of 13, to its affiliate, Screen Actors Guild Awards, LLC, and associated vendors (including vendors engaged by motion picture and television companies representing prospective or actual nominees in connection with “For Your Consideration” communications and screeners) for purposes of allowing members to participate in activities related to and voting for the Screen Actors Guild Awards and to receive benefits and other communications from Screen Actors Guild Awards vendors. Additionally, SAG-AFTRA may disclose, via its Actors to Locate Service, contact information for the child’s agent, if any, or the child’s business contact phone number. </li>
<li>In the course of administering claims under its industry agreements (for example, in collecting and distributing unpaid theatrical or television residuals), SAG-AFTRA may use and disclose information relating to the members affected thereby, regardless of the manner by which that information was collected. This may include information provided through the Services.</li>
<li>SAG-AFTRA allows its members to pay their membership dues through the Services. Through the Dues Online feature, SAG-AFTRA collects certain information necessary to complete the transaction, including a credit card number, expiration date and security code, and the billing address associated with the card. This information is shared with the third party credit card processor and is used solely for the purposes of completing the authorized transaction.</li>
<li>The iActor portion of the site is intended to serve as a “job board.”  On the iActor portion of the site, Resume Data is specifically intended to be made available to third parties such as casting directors, producers, directors, agents, and others and may be used by such parties to contact the child and evaluate his or her potential employment.  Such third parties can search and view Resume Data of participating Guild members and Guild members may communicate directly with such third parties, including transmission of resume data to them.  You hereby authorize SAG-AFTRA to make all such disclosures of the child’s Resume Data to third parties as stated above and contemplated in the iActor Member Guide.  Third parties will be required to agree that they may use such information only to contact the child or his or her representative for legitimate employment opportunities and to keep such information confidential and secure, but SAG-AFTRA cannot make any guarantees of compliance by third parties and SAG-AFTRA will not be responsible in any manner should such parties fail to comply with such agreement.   </li>
<li>If a child or his or her representatives opt-in to receive direct deposit of residuals payments, SAG-AFTRA will share information regarding the child to our service provider for the limited purpose of facilitating the direct deposit services for such child. The child and his or her representatives may be required to agree to the service provider’s policies, , including with regard to use of your personal information, as a condition of registering for the service.</li>
<li>We may provide residuals information to a child’s agents, managers, and other representatives as part of our “residuals tracker” feature offered to our franchised agents.</li>
<li>Except as otherwise disclosed in this Policy, we do not share any information about a child with any affiliated entity or with any third parties unless the disclosure is reasonably necessary: to comply with law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Use or site rules; or to protect the safety and security of our guests and our Web sites. 
<p> </p>
</li>
</ol><li><strong>C. How do we notify and obtain consent from parents for the collection of information from a child?</strong> Before allowing a child to use a feature of our Web sites that might result in the disclosure of the child’s information to third parties on the Internet, we require the parent to consent to this Children’s Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, and our more general Privacy Policy and to provide us with evidence confirming their identity, as discussed in our <a href="#consent">consent process</a>.  This information is retained by us as evidence that we received parental consent. </li>
<li><strong>D. How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their child?</strong></li>
<ol type="1" start="1"><li>Parents may at any time refuse to permit us to collect further personal information from their child through the Services. We use two methods to allow parents to access, change, or delete the personally identifiable information that we have collected from their child.</li>
</ol><ul type="square"><li>(a)A parent may access, change, or delete his or her child’s personal information by logging on to the child’s account located at <a href="http://www.sagaftra.org/registration">SAGAFTRA.org</a>. The parent will need to have their child’s member name and password. If your child has forgotten the password, click on ‘Forgot Password?” link on the home page and follow the instructions</li>
<li>(b) A parent may contact our Contact Center to access, change, or delete the personal information that we have collected from his or her child by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org">sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org</a>.  Please include the child’s member name and the parent's e-mail address in the e-mail so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request. </li>
</ul><p>Please note that only the parent identified in the child’s records may submit these requests.</p>
<ul type="disc"><li><strong><strong>E. How will we notify parents if our Children’s Privacy Policy changes?</strong></strong>
<p> </p>
<p>We may amend our Children’s Privacy Policy at any time. We may provide notice to parents by e-mail regarding any material changes in the way we intend to collect, use, and/or share a child’s personal information.

<p><strong>CONSENT OF PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN</strong></p>
<p>As you may be aware, state and federal law, including the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), require website operators to implement certain protections prior to granting children access to interactive functions of the website.  Certain features of SAG-AFTRA’s websites require the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, so we have implemented a policy that requires verifiable parental consent before users under the age of 18 can register on the site.</p>
<p>We realize that parents are often the primary users of their child’s account. However, if a child is the account-holder of record and our records indicate that child is under the age of 18, we will assume that the child is the one accessing the site and we therefore must take these steps.</p>
<p>There are two ways you can provide your consent:</p>
<p>1)            You may download the website policies and parental consent form, fill out the form completely, sign and date it then either mail or fax it back to the SAG-AFTRA at the address or fax number provided on the form. Please also include a copy of your current valid driver's license or other similar government ID.  Please click <a href="/files/sag-aftra_coppa_documents.pdf">here</a> to download the form</p>
<p>2)            You may complete the form online through Docusign, Inc., where you will have another chance to review our website policies before e-signing. In addition to completing the form, you will be asked to enter certain additional pieces of information to verify your identity. The information you provide on the form will not be used to update your child’s SAG-AFTRA records, except to note that you have given your consent. Please click <a href="https://www.docusign.net/Member/PowerFormSigning.aspx?PowerFormId=02704272-fb0b-4c5a-bb67-906a95a90783">here</a> to start the online consent process. </p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA will retain a copy of the consent form for purposes of recording your consent and, if necessary, to contact you in the future relating your child’s use of the website.</p>
<p>Please note that once you have submitted the required information, there may be a delay of approximately one business day to grant or restore your child’s access.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please contact the Contact Center by phone at (855) 724-2387 or by email to <a href="mailto:sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org">sagaftrainfo@sagaftra.org</a>.</p>
