    <p>WIS relies on the parties that it does business with to help the company achieve its commitment to a

    <ul>
        <li>dishonest, fraudulent, corrupt or illegal conducts;</li>
        <li>unethical actions or behaviours (including bribe, facilitation payment or other kick-backs, inappropriate gifts; falsifying documents or other unacceptable or unethical behaviour);</li>
        <li>actions that have the potential to damage WIS' property, people or reputation or that of another party (such as unsafe work practices, environmental damage, health risks or substantial wasting of company resources); or</li>
