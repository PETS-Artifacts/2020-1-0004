     <div > 
        <p><b>I. Your Privacy at CiteMan Network</b>
        <p>When registering you do not need to provide any information except 
          the bare minimum that we need for your account: a username, email and 
          a password. Unlike many other sites we will never sell the emails to 
          unscrupulous spammers. In fact, we won't sell emails or give them to 
          anyone regardless of their scruples unless we are ordered to by law 
          (in the extreme case that law enforcement formally requests this information 
          we will comply with the law). We collect no personal information about 
          you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide this information 
          to us. If you have any suggestions on how we can improve our commitment 
          to your privacy please don't hesitate to contact us, there is nothing 
          we know of that we can do to show more respect for your privacy but 
          if you think there is let us know.</p>
        <p><b>II. What We Collect and Store Automatically</b></p>
        <p>If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, 
          read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain 
          information about your visit automatically. This information does not 
          identify you personally. Rather, information is kept in the aggregate. 
          We automatically collect and store only the information about your visit. 
          We use the information we collect to understand the traffic to our site 
          (for example, it's important to know how much bandwidth the site uses 
          so that we can purchase more if needed, if the &quot;hits&quot; to our 
          site increase we need to pay more money for better hosting), and to 
          help us make our site more useful to visitors like you.</p>
        <p><b>III. If You Send Us E-mail</b></p>
        <p>You may choose to provide us with personal information, as in e-mail 
          with a comment or question. We use the information to improve our service 
          to you or to respond to your request. Except for authorized law enforcement 
          investigations, we do not share our e-mail with any other outside organizations.</p>
