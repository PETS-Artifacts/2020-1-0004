You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SupplyFrame or its assets may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. You hereby consent to SupplyFrame sharing your Personal Information under the above circumstances.</p>

<p>We may send you service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notice that we have changed the Service, the Terms of Service, or the Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to terminate the Account you may have with us. You understand that any termination of your Account may involve deletion of your Account information (and associated Content) from our live databases and all the information and data stored for such Account in the SupplyFrame Offerings. SupplyFrame will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any termination of your account or related deletion of you information.</p>

<p>The SupplyFrame Offerings may contain links to other web sites that are not owned or controlled by SupplyFrame. The provision of such links is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such web sites or location or its contents.
