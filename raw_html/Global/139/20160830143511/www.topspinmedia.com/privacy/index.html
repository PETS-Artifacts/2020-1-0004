Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the Topspin managed domains (currently <a href="http://topspinmedia.com" target="_blank">topspinmedia.com</a>, <a href="http://topspin.net" target="_blank">topspin.net</a> and <a href="http://artistlink.com" target="_blank">artistlink.com</a>) and websites or domain name, features, content, widgets, or application services offered from time to time by Topspin in connection therewith (collectively, the &quot;Website&quot;), submitting information, or using any of our services, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p><p>Topspin complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Topspin has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Topspin’s certification, please <a href="http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/" target="_blank">visit the U.S.-EU &amp; U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks on at export.gov</a>.</p>
    <b>WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?</b>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers Topspin’s treatment of personally identifiable information (&quot;Personal Information&quot;) that Topspin gathers when you are accessing the Website and when you use Topspin services, such as our widgets. Also, this Privacy Policy covers Topspin’s treatment of certain non-personally identifiable information about you and any Personal Information that Topspin’s business partners share with Topspin. While this policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Topspin does not own or control, or to individuals that Topspin does not employ or manage, we will list out those partners and how you can get in touch with them to inquire about their own privacy policies.</p>
    <b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES TOPSPIN COLLECT?</b>
    <p>The information we gather from customers enables us to personalize and improve our services and to allow our users to set up a user account and profile that can be used to interact with other users through the Website. In connection with the Website, we may request and display some personal information to other users and visitors of Website, which allows users to identify each other. We collect the following types of information from our customers.</p>
    <b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DO YOU PROVIDE TO US?</b>
    <p>We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include, without limitation, your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, password, contact information, phone number, transactional information based on your activities on the Website, and media consumed on the Website including, but not limited to, media viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for purposes such as responding to your requests for certain products and services, allowing you to interact with other users, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials, sales offers, and new features.</p>
    <b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY?</b>
    <p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or services. Topspin automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, the page you requested, and the media you have consumed (e.g., viewed, played, downloaded, uploaded, and shared).</p><p>Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. This type of data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve those services. As part of this use of information, (i) we may provide information to the content owners that relates to their fans (e.g., regarding which fans are consuming and sharing what pieces of media at what levels), and (ii) we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Website (e.g., we share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their services and our Website, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience).</p>
    <b>WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BT THIRD PARTIES?</b>
    <p>Topspin has contracted with third-party service providers to provide certain services to us, including monitoring certain pages of our website for the purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement &quot;click-thrus,&quot; and/or other activities on our website. Where authorized by us, these service providers may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to compile data about our website visitors. For more information, please see the &quot;What About Cookies?&quot; and &quot;Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)&quot; sections of this Privacy Policy. If you have any questions about how information is collected and used by our service providers, please <a href="http://legal@topspinmedia.com" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</p>
    <b>HOW DO WE COMMUNICATE?</b>
    <p>Topspin provides a marketing tool via the Website to allow artists and their representatives to market and distribute their media directly to users of the Website through e-mail, phone/voicemail and other forms of communication. If you are a fan of Topspin and want to subscribe to our newsletter, you can do so by entering your email address on our Website. We often receive a confirmation when you access a message from Topspin. Topspin uses this confirmation to improve the effectiveness of the marketing. If you do not want to receive communications from us or the artists who use Topspin’s platform, please click the unsubscribe link contained at the bottom of any email sent using Topspin’s service. Note however that you cannot unsubscribe from some administrative emails, such as order or shipment confirmations.</p>
    <b>HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THE COLLECTION OF CHILDREN&#39;S DATA (PEOPLE UNDER THE AGE OF 13)?</b>
    <p>Some of our artist’s sites may be reasonably attractive to children. We do not intend to collect personal information from children under the age of 13, and if we find out we have collected this information, we will dispose of it immediately. Additionally, when our artists are aware that their music and other content may be reasonably attractive to children, we provide them with tools to ask for a user’s date of birth and prevent the collection of personal information from children under 13.</p>
    <b>HOW DO TOPSPIN WIDGETS WORK?</b>
    <p>Our Website and data collection devices include &quot;Widgets,&quot; which are interactive mini-programs that run on our artists’ sites to provide specific services from the artist (e.g. trading an email for a free song, purchasing an album, playing music, etc.). Personal information, such as your email address, may be collected through the Widget, which will subscribe you to an artist’s newsletter in exchange for a free song. Cookies may also be set by the Widget to enable it to function properly. Topspin Widgets collect the same personal information that may be collected by the Website, as described above. Topspin is the data processor of the personal information collected through these Widgets when the Widgets are on an artist’s site. However, because the artists are actually the controllers of this data, you should also refer to their privacy policy. Data is used by Topspin and the respective artists only for the purpose it is intended for.</p><p>Some of our Widgets have an &quot;Email a friend&quot; feature. If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about an artist, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. The Widget will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.</p><p>Our Widgets also have a &quot;share&quot; feature. If you choose to use our share service to repost a Widget on another website, the third party website will request your login credentials (such as on Twitter or Facebook). The Widget will then automatically post the Widget on that website, which is governed by that third party website’s privacy policy.</p>
    <b>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT IN OUR FORUMS?</b>
    <p>If you use our bulletin board, blog, or chat room on this Website, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at the email address listed below. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>
    <b>DOES TOPSPIN USE COOKIES?</b>
    <p>Like other websites and web-based technologies, we use cookies to collect information about how people use Topspin. We use this information to make our application better. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our Website are visited and by how many people.

These cookies enable more customized ads, content or services to be provided to you. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or hashed (non-human readable) identifier corresponding to your email address to a Web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is on, or is connected to, these cookies.
    If you are interested in blocking cookies and other web-based tracking technologies, we suggest exploring the following browser plug-ins and extensions:</p><p>If you are interested in blocking cookies and other web-based tracking technologies, we recommend exploring the following browser plug-ins and extensions:</p>

Opting out does not do the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Stop ads altogether</li><li>Disable other companies or exchanges interest-based ads</li><li>Opt you out across multiple browsers or computers at once</li><li>Keep you opted out after you clear your browser’s cookies.</li></ul>
    <p>If you are interested in stopping ads altogether, we recommend using a web plug-in such as <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>, which works across multiple browsers and operating systems.</p>

We may share your Personal Information when we have your permission, and we may share your Personal Information under the following circumstances:</p><p>Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control: We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses sell items to you through the Website, for example, the bands, musicians and other artists from which you purchase or use products or services through the Website.

Email addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles and to communicate through User Submissions.</p><p>Third Party Advertisers: Topspin may serve third-party ads on or through the Website. In that event, we may share certain information about you with such advertisers and/or with advertising networks so that advertisers can present you with offers that are relevant to you.

We may share aggregated information that includes your Personal Information, non-personally identifying information and log data with third parties for industry analysis, demographic profiling, and to deliver targeted advertising about other products and services.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur in any of these circumstances, and that any acquirer or successor of Topspin may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.</p><p>Protection of Topspin and Others: We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Topspin, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p><p>With Your Consent: Except as set forth herein, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p><p>As we mentioned above, we use some third parties to help us provide you with our services.
