<p><strong><span>Objective</span></strong><strong>:</strong> To establish a policy for the collection, use and protection of data and information obtained by GTECH Indiana regarding Players and Persons while acting in its capacity as a vendor to the Hoosier Lottery.  This Policy complies with relevant U.S. laws and regulations and with the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles developed by the US Department of Commerce.</p>
<p><strong>I. Introduction</strong><br /> The Hoosier Lottery, its agents, contractors, and any parties, including GTECH Indiana, LLC and GTECH Corporation (hereby referred to collectively as the “Hoosier Lottery”) have established the following Privacy Policy for the protection of data and information obtained by Hoosier Lottery Players. This Privacy Policy applies to the capture, handling, sharing and storage of all information received, including but not limited to, information obtained from Players through the Hoosier Lottery Website. <br /> Due to the changing needs of the Hoosier Lottery and/or Indiana State Law, this Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time without notice. Changes will be posted on the Hoosier Lottery Website.  By accessing the Hoosier Lottery Website, Players and Persons consent to and accept this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy describes the Hoosier Lottery’s privacy practices regarding information collected at any time through any means. <br /> <br /> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “you” or “your” means each person, group of individuals, entity or entities.<br /> <br /> For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Personal Information" means information about a natural person that is readily identifiable to that specific individual.  Personal Information includes, among other information, an individual’s name, address, social security number, telephone number, date of birth, password information, and any other personally identifiable information.  A domain name or Internet protocol address is not considered Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>II. Basic Principles</strong><br /> The Hoosier Lottery and its representative agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will not intentionally gather or maintain Personal Information that is not relevant to us in conducting our business, and will take steps to assure the accuracy of the Personal Information that is in our custody and management.</li>
<li>Will treat all Personal Information as confidential to the extent authorized by law, and take reasonable precautions designed to prevent inappropriate or unauthorized disclosure of such Personal Information;</li>
<li>Will not use Personal Information for purposes that are incompatible with our business unless affected individuals are appropriately contacted for their consent;</li>
<li>Will not transfer Personal Information to third parties, except as required by our business and/or by law;</li>
<li>Will deal fairly with those persons whose Personal Information is in our custody and management.<strong> </strong></li>

<ul>
<li>the Internet protocol (“IP”) address and domain name used (for example, aol.com if you are accessing from America Online).

Cookies <br /> Cookies are text files stored on a Person’s web browser to provide a means of distinguishing that Person from other visitors to the Website. Website providers use “transactional cookies” to enhance or customize a Person’s visit to the Website and to recognize that Person when he or she visits again. The software and hardware used to access the Website may allow a Person to refuse new cookies or delete existing cookies.

Upon deactivation, please understand that, despite deactivation of an account online, state record retention laws may require the Hoosier Lottery to maintain information about your account.</p>
<p>The Hoosier Lottery does not collect information for commercial marketing.  It will not sell or rent personally identifiable information to anyone.  The Hoosier Lottery may provide certain information to contractors for research or other purposes, including but not limited to disclosing site traffic information to improve the use of the site to our visitors.  These third parties do not have the right to use this information beyond what is necessary to perform required functions.

</ul>
<p>By submitting foregoing information, a Person will be deemed to have consented to its use for such purposes.</p>
<p><strong>V. Non-disclosure of personal information</strong><br /> As noted above, no Personal Information is collected unless such information is provided voluntarily by sending an e-mail, participating in a survey, registering for a My Lottery Account, or using other interactive services that may be provided on the Website.  Players may choose not to utilize some or all of these interactive services.  The choice not to participate in these activities may limit the ability to receive specific services or products, but it will not prevent a Person from requesting services or products from the Hoosier Lottery by other means and will not normally have an impact on the ability to take advantage of other (non-interactive) features of the Website, including browsing or downloading publicly available information.</p>
<p><strong>VI. Review and correction of personal information</strong><br /> Players can view information collected about them and correct inaccuracies by using the Contact Us section on the Website.  Players can also review and correct certain Personal Information by signing into his or her My Lottery Account and accessing the My Lottery Account profile. </p>
<p><strong>VII. Voluntary Disclosure of information </strong><br /> Voluntary disclosure of Personal Information to the Hoosier Lottery, whether solicited or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of such information by the Hoosier Lottery and Third Party Service Providers for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Certain state or federal laws may protect that information.   <br /> Without limiting the foregoing, Personal Information may be collected or disclosed without  consent if the collection or disclosure is:<br /> (1) necessary to perform the statutory duties of the Hoosier Lottery, or necessary for the Hoosier Lottery to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state or federal statute or regulation, including the Indiana Access to Public Records Act;<br /> (2) made pursuant to a court order, subpoena or by law;<br /> (3) for the purpose of validating the discloser’s identity;<br /> (4) with affiliates of the Hoosier Lottery or Third Party Service Providers to provide certain lottery related services; or<br /> (5) to federal or state law enforcement authorities to enforce the Hoosier Lottery’s rights against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to the Hoosier Lottery’s information technology assets or against other inappropriate use.<br /> In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and any state or federal laws, including the Indiana Access to Public Records Act, the state or federal laws will control.</p>
<p><strong>VIII. Security</strong><br /> The Hoosier Lottery is committed to ensuring the integrity of the information and systems it maintains. As such, the Hoosier Lottery has instituted security measures for all information systems under our control so that information will not be lost, misused, or altered. For site security purposes and to ensure that our Internet services remain available to all users, the Hoosier Lottery uses software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.</p>

<h1>Convenience App Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Hoosier Lottery Mobile Convenience Application</h2>
<p><strong>I. Introduction</strong><br /> The Hoosier Lottery, with its agents and contractors, including GTECH Indiana, LLC (together, referred to as the “Hoosier Lottery”), has established the following Privacy Policy to explain our policies and practices related to the use and protection of data and information that we obtain from users of the Hoosier Lottery Mobile Convenience Application (“App”). This Privacy Policy describes and applies to the collection, sharing, use, and storage of all information received, including but not limited to, information obtained from Players through the App.</p>
<p>We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of material changes through whatever means are practical, as permitted by law. If you find our privacy policies or any changes to this Policy unacceptable, you have the right to erase the App from your mobile device or discontinue your use of the App. By interacting with the App, you consent to and accept this Privacy Policy. <br /> When we use the terms “we”, “us” or “our” in this Policy, we mean the Hoosier Lottery. The terms “user”, “you” or “your” refer to you as a person who uses the App and may provide data or information to us.</p>
<p>When we use the term “Personal Information" in this Policy, we mean information about a natural person that identifies that person. Personal Information includes a natural person’s first and last name, home or other physical address, social security number, any other identifier that permits the physical or online contact of a natural person, and information concerning a natural person that is collected online and maintained in personally identifiable form in combination with an identifier described above. A domain name, location, or Internet protocol address is not considered Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>II. What types of information do we collect from you?</strong></p>
<p>We collect and use various types of information when you download and use the App, so that we can optimize your user experience, understand better our interactive users and lottery players, and gather data for analysis so we can improve the App and our business generally.</p>
<ul>
<li>By your use of the App and nothing further, we may automatically gather and store information including, but not limited to, the following:</li>
<li>The Internet protocol (“IP”) address and domain name used (for example, aol.com if you are accessing from America Online). The IP address is a numerical identifier assigned to your computer or mobile device. Location may also be identified via geo-filtering of the IP address.</li>
<li>The type of device you are using.</li>
<li>The browser and operating system used.</li>
<li>The date and time of the App download or visit.</li>
<li>The pages or services accessed while using the App.</li>
<li>If you use the Facebook sharing feature, information regarding your share, including your Facebook username, content shared from the App, with whom content is shared, and where content is posted.</li>
<ul>
<li>Please note that Facebook may also collect information from you if you use the Facebook sharing feature. Facebook’s collection and use of your information is not covered by this Policy.</li>
</ul>
<li>If you downloaded forms or other documents, the forms or documents that you downloaded.</li>

</ul>
<p>None of the foregoing information is deemed to be Personal Information. We do not collect Personal Information through the App.</p>

<p>The Hoosier Lottery does not use collected information for commercial marketing. It will not sell or rent Personal Information to anyone. The Hoosier Lottery may provide certain information to contractors for research or other purposes, including but not limited to App traffic information to improve the use of the App to our users. These third parties are contractually required to use this information only for what is necessary to perform required functions.</p>
<p>We use information that we collect from App users primarily to conduct our own internal business activities, including providing you with an optimal interactive experience. More specifically, we may use data and information that we gather from you to:</p>

</ul>
<p>We may ask for your consent to use your information in certain ways outside of our ordinary practices. If we do that, you will be given the opportunity to “opt-in”, i.e., to choose whether or not we use your information in this manner.</p>
<p>If you voluntarily provide information to us, you will be deemed to have consented to the collection and use of this information for the above-described purposes, subject to state and federal laws.</p>
<p>We may be required by law to disclose certain information. If a valid legal process, such as a subpoena, court order, or search warrant, requires us to disclose certain information, we will do so. We will comply with laws and regulations regarding notice and opportunity for you to object to these required disclosures. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and any state or federal laws, including the Indiana Access to Public Records Act, the state or federal laws will control.</p>
<p><strong>IV. How do we protect your information?</strong></p>
<p>We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural security measures for all information systems under our control so that information will not be lost, misused, or altered. For site security purposes and to ensure that our Internet services remain available to all users, the Hoosier Lottery uses software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations and in accordance with any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual.<br /> If information is protected by state or federal law, including the Indiana Access to Public Records Act, we will comply with that law and the rulings of a judicial or quasi-judicial body in interpreting that law.</p>
<p><strong>V. What choices can you make about your information?</strong></p>
<p>You may discontinue using the App or uninstall the App to eliminate our ability to gather additional data and information from your use of the App. Upon uninstallation, please understand that record retention laws may require us to maintain information about your account.</p>
<p>If you believe that we are not handling your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, you can contact GTECH Indiana’s Director of Corporate Social Responsibility and Compliance, who will discuss the issue with you, conduct an investigation, and report back to you in an attempt to resolve the issues quickly and amicably.</p>

The text of this Privacy Policy cannot address every potential issue and circumstance. It is our policy to adhere to or exceed state and federal privacy and data protection laws and regulations. This Policy will be available on the Hoosier Lottery website and through any other relevant player interface.</p>
