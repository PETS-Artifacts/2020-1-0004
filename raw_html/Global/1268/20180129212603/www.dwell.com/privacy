This privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”) is to help you understand what data Dwell collects, and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information. This Privacy Policy governs the website and Dwell’s other digital products and services, including its mobile application (collectively, “Services”). Additionally, our <a href="/terms">Terms of Service</a> are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy. The terms “Dwell,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to, collectively, Dwell Life, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its affiliates, headquartered in San Francisco, California in the United States.</p><h2>Information We Collect</h2><p>We collect information that you provide to us directly or automatically when you use the Services.</p><h3>Information that you provide us or give us permission to obtain</h3><p>When you register an account to use the Services, you voluntarily give us certain information. This information includes, but is not limited to: your name; gender; title; biographical information; username; and password. If you are creating a professional or brand account, we collect additional information including, but not limited to: your business name; business category; business description; business address; contact information; information about the size of the business. This information is used to create your profile on Dwell. You can customize some of the information displayed publicly in your Dwell profile by going to your account and profile settings. If you provide us with profile information and you do not see a visibility setting, that information is public.</p><p>When you use the Services, you voluntarily provide us with additional information, including your recommendations, comments,  replies to comments, users you are following, photos that you upload, collections of photos either that you or other users have uploaded, annotations on photos, photo collaborations, photo and story credits, and related data and content. You acknowledge and agree that the Services are for public consumption, including your photos, stories, and collections. By posting information using the Services, you agree to permit us to publicly disclose this material, as described in <a href="/terms">Dwell’s Terms of Service</a>.</p><p>If you make a purchase using the Services, you provide us with payment information, contact information and information on what you purchased. If you e-mail us, we may keep your message, e-mail address, and other contact information.</p><p>If you are using the Services on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data. You may also give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link one or more of your social media accounts to the Services, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts). The information we get from those services depends on your settings or their privacy policies.</p><p>The Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook Like button, and widgets such as a “share” button, or other interactive features.  These features may collect various personally identifiable information and cookies to enable the feature to work correctly. These features and widgets are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.</p><h3>Information that we collect automatically when you use the Services</h3><p>When you use the Services, data is created and recorded automatically. Some of the types of information that we collect are:</p><ul><li><strong>Log data.</strong> When you use the Services, our servers automatically record information (“Log Data”), including but not limited to information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or that your mobile app sends when you are using it. This log data may include your IP address, the address of the web pages you visited that had Dwell features, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used the Services, and cookie data.</li><li><strong>Cookie data.</strong> Depending on how you are accessing the Services, we may use “cookies” (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our Services, unique to your Dwell account or your browser) or similar technologies to record Log Data. When we use cookies, we may use “session” cookies (that last until you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies. However, if you choose to refuse cookies, some features of the Services may not function properly.</li><li><strong>Device information.</strong> In addition to Log Data, we may also collect information about the device on which you are using the Services, including what type of device it is, what operating system you are using, device settings, unique device identifiers, your geolocation, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you are using and its settings.</li><li><strong>Do Not Track.</strong> Your browser may support a “Do Not Track” option that can be selected in your browser settings, which sends a signal to websites you visit informing them that you do not want certain information about your visit to be collected. At this time we do not respond to browser “Do Not Track” signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</li><li><strong>Analytics and Usage.</strong> We use data analytics and work with certain third party service providers to help us understand and improve the use of our Services. These third party service providers may collect information sent by your device as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
