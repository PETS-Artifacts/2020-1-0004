Effective Since: January 2004</p>
<p>Rosewood Hotels and Resorts, L.L.C. ("Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts," "Rosewood," "we," or "us") is committed to safeguarding your privacy while visiting the Rosewood web sites, namely, rosewoodhotels.com, rosewoodelite.com, and rosewoodgiftcard.com (collectively, "the Site"). Our goal is to provide you with an Internet experience that delivers the information, resources and services that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, part of the operation of the Site includes gathering certain types of information about Site users. Because we understand that your privacy is important, we wish to explain the types of information we collect and the ways in which this information is used.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy sets out the basis on which we will process any personal data we collect from you or that you provide to us.&nbsp; This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect on the Site, and through e-mail, text, and other electronic messages between you and the Site. </p>
<p>Please read the following carefully to understand our practices regarding information collected on this Site.&nbsp; By visiting the Site, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>1. What Information is Collected About Me?<br />
2. How is My Information Used?<br />
3. How Can I Change My Information or Preferences?<br />
4. What About Cookies and Web Beacons?<br />
5. What Information is Collected From Children?<br />
6. What Websites Does This Policy Cover?<br />
7. How Do We Protect Personal Information Collected on This Site?<br />
8. What Happens to My Information if There is a Corporate Change of Control?<br />
9. What About Policy Modifications?<br />
10. How can I ask a Question or Raise a Concern?</p>
<p><strong>1. What Information is Collected About Me?</strong><br />
We may collect two types of information about you when you visit the Site, personal and non-personal (or aggregated) information. The term "personal information" refers to data you voluntarily provide in connection with the use of the Site that identifies you and/or the company on whose behalf you are accessing and using the Site. &nbsp;Personal information includes, for example, data submitted in connection with our services, such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, company affiliation, physical address and/or certain other personal information.&nbsp; We may ask you for personal information when you request information from us, enter a contest or promotion sponsored by us, or when you report a problem with the Site.&nbsp; The information we collect on or through the Site may also include records and copies of your correspondence, if you contact us, your responses to surveys we may ask you to complete for research purposes, details of transactions you carry out through the Site, and the fulfillment of your orders.&nbsp; We are working closely with certain third parties (including, for example, business partners, contractors in technical, payment, and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers) and we may also receive personal information about you from them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>We may collect additional personal information in connection with online reservations or purchasing gift cards. If you decide to make an online reservation at one of our properties, or if you decide to purchase one of our gift cards, you will be linked to a separate interface.&nbsp; The reservation interfaces and the gift card interface are each designed and administered by third-party vendors and hosted by those vendors&rsquo; own hosting partners. Reservation data and information used to purchase gift cards are handled by our vendors exclusively for the purpose of processing the transactions. &nbsp;In addition to being asked to provide the types of personal information discussed above, for purposes of making a reservation or purchasing a gift card through the Site, you may be required to provide sensitive personal information, such as your mailing address, telephone number, email address and credit card information.&nbsp; When you make a reservation, your personal information goes into a central reservations database that can be accessed by our affiliates and other Rosewood hotels and resorts.&nbsp; Information collected as part of the reservation process is used as described in this Privacy Policy, whether or not you actually use the reservation.&nbsp; Rosewood Hotels cannot expressly warrant the operation of the reservation and gift card web site and/or matters relating to its security once you log on. Be sure to log off when you are done using the reservation site or the gift card site.</p>
<p>Rosewood may also collect non-personal information, or &ldquo;aggregated data,&rdquo; from you when you visit the Site.&nbsp; The term "aggregated data" refers to general information regarding visitors and users of the Site that relates to use of the Site (e.g., traffic patterns, number of visits to certain pages, visits from other web sites or to third-party web sites linked to the Site, use of particular services and interest in services, information or features of the Site or other parties made available through or found at the Site).&nbsp; Additionally, with regard to each of your visits to our Site, we may automatically collect certain types of technical information, including, for example, the Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, time zone setting, language setting, browser plug-in types and versions, and operating system and platform.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>2. How is My Information Used?</strong><br />
Rosewood considers the personal information collected on this Site to be confidential. We will not sell, rent, or share your information without your consent except in accordance with this Privacy Policy or for the purposes disclosed on any online form or location on this Site where you provide personal information to us.</p>
<p>We use the personal information you provide to respond to your requests and to allow you to participate in our promotions, surveys, subscribe to our e-mail or postal mail lists, or provide you with information or services. We may in some cases use this information to inform you of special offers that may be forthcoming or products and services offered by our affiliates or business partners. To do these things, we may share your personal information with our affiliates or others who work for us (including, for example, business partners, contractors in technical, payment, and delivery services, advertising networks, analytics providers, and search information providers).&nbsp;If we cease to operate a hotel property we do not own, the owner may continue to have and use your personal information for continued business purposes consistent with the hotel&rsquo;s operations, including marketing and other purposes addressed above. </p>
<p>Aggregated data about your Site visit is used to improve the Site and to guide the development of new features and services. We monitor aggregated data regarding use of the Site for marketing purposes and to study, improve, and promote use of the Site. In connection with such purposes, Rosewood may share aggregated data with third parties collectively, in an anonymous way, which does not reveal personal information about individual Site users, or identify who they are or how to contact them.</p>
<p>To the extent required or permitted by law, any information regarding the use of our web sites (personal and non-personal) may be disclosed to government authorities or third parties pursuant to a legal request, subpoena, or other legal process. We may also use or disclose your information as permitted by law to collect debts, fight fraud, or protect the rights or property of Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts, our customers, our web sites, their users or third parties, or when we otherwise believe in good faith that the law requires it.</p>
<p><strong>3. How Can I Change My Information or Preferences?</strong><br />
We respect your right to control how your personal information is used. If, after consenting to our use of your personal information, you later decide that you no longer want Rosewood to include you on its mailing list, otherwise contact you, or use your personal information in the manners disclosed in this Privacy Policy or at the Site, simply tell us by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:rosewood@rosewoodhotels.com">rosewood@rosewoodhotels.com</a>.</p>
<p>If you have opted to receive communications from Rosewood Hotels &amp; Resorts, and need to change your information, such as your mailing address, e-mail address, etc., you must unsubscribe and then register or submit your personal information anew.</p>
<p><strong>4. What About Cookies and Web Beacons?</strong><br />
To enable features at the Site, we may use cookies or web beacons on this website, in e-mails or e-mail advertisements, or in advertisements on other web sites. Cookies, among other things, speed navigation through our Site, keep track of information so that you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our Site, help us provide you with customized content and allow us to learn about your visit. A cookie is an Internet device composed of a small text file containing a unique identification number that permits a web server to send small pieces of information or text by means of your browser and place them on your computer's hard drive for storage. This text lets the web server know if you have previously visited the web page. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user.</p>
<p>Web beacons, also called web bugs, pixel tags, or clear GIFs, help us measure the effectiveness of our online advertising and/or e-mail campaigns by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit our website or the number of individuals who open or act upon an e-mail message. We may allow third parties to compile information or aggregated statistics from our use of web beacons to help them assess the effectiveness of online marketing and to enable us and our advertisers to deliver more targeted advertising opportunities. This means that users see advertising more likely to be of interest to them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads.</p>
<p>We use cookies and web beacons primarily to collect and maintain aggregated data (such as the number of visitors) to help us see which areas are most popular with our users and improve and update the content on our site and in our Internet advertising. While in the process of browsing our site, you also provide us with information that doesn't reveal your personal identity -- what type of destination you're exploring, for example. We use this aggregated data only as explained in this Privacy Policy. Some of the information we collect using web beacons may be personally identifiable. We may combine this information with other personal information we have collected about you to better tailor our marketing or website content to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as internal research. We do not connect aggregated data to any name, mailing or e-mail address, or other personally identifying information and do not allow unrelated third parties to access personal information from our use of web beacons.</p>
<p>You may occasionally receive cookies from unaffiliated companies or organizations, to the extent they place advertising on our Site or are linked to the Site. These third-party cookies may collect information about you when you "click" on their advertising or content or link. This practice is standard in the Internet industry. Because of the way in which the Internet operates, we cannot control collection of this information by these third parties. These third party advertisers or linked websites are subject to their own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. If you do not want to accept cookies placed by these companies, you can disable cookies by adjusting the settings on your web browser. </p>
<p><strong>5. What Information is Collected From Children?</strong><br />
Please be aware that Rosewood has not designed this Site for, and does not intend for it to be used by, anyone under age 13.&nbsp; We do present information regarding our Rose Buds<sup>&reg;</sup> program on this Site for the reference of adults that are interested in activities at our locations for children. &nbsp;Accordingly, this Site should not be used by anyone under age 13 without adult supervision. If you are under 13, please do not provide personal information of any kind whatsoever. Should Rosewood inadvertently acquire personal information or other data from users under the age of 13, Rosewood will not knowingly provide this data to any third party for any purpose. If a child does provide us with personal information over this Site, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us and upon notification, we will delete from our records any information collected from children under the age of 13.</p>
<p><strong>6. What Websites Does This Policy Cover?</strong><br />
This Privacy Policy applies only to rosewoodhotels.com, rosewoodelite.com, and rosewoodgiftcard.com, which are collectively defined as &ldquo;the Site&rdquo; in the first paragraph of this Privacy Policy. Rosewood may provide links to a number of other web sites that we believe might offer you useful information and services. However, those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Rosewood. </p>
<p>We are not responsible for the privacy policies or the actions of any third parties, including without limitation, any web site owners whose sites may be reached through this Site, nor can we control the activities of those web sites. We urge you to contact the relevant parties controlling these sites or review their on-line policies to obtain information about their data collection practices before submitting any personal information or other sensitive data.</p>
<p><strong>7. How Do We Protect Personal Information Collected on This Site?</strong><br />
E-mail communication to and from our web site is not secure unless clearly noted otherwise. This is a risk inherent in the use of e-mail. Please be aware of this when requesting information or sending information or forms to us by e-mail.</p>
<p>We take reasonable precautions to protect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, our internal database created from online activity on the Site. However, Rosewood does not warrant or represent that its level of security meets or exceeds any particular standard. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission or storage database is wholly secure or error-free.</p>
<p><strong>8. What Happens to My Information if There is a Corporate Change of Control?</strong><br />
In the event of a corporate change in control resulting from, for example, a sale of the company or its assets to another entity, or merger with another entity, Rosewood reserves the right to transfer your personal information to the new party in control.</p>
<p><strong>9. What About Policy Modifications?</strong><br />
Rosewood reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Notice of changes will be published on this page by posting the revised policy with the revision date on this page. Your use of the Site after a change to this Privacy Policy has been posted constitutes your acceptance of those changes. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy and stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect.</p>
<p><strong>10. How can I ask a Question or Raise a Concern?</strong><br />

<p><strong>NOTE TO USERS IN EUROPEAN UNION AND OTHER COUNTRIES WITH DATA PROTECTION LAWS:</strong></p>
<p>Rosewood is committed to protecting personal information to the fullest extent of this Privacy Policy.

That is, you freely and unambiguously agree that:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Terms of this Privacy Policy, not your home country's laws, control how Rosewood will process personal data about you; </li>
    <li>Sensitive data, such as data involving your health, will also be processed consistent with this Privacy Policy and transmitted to/processed in the United States, a jurisdiction without equivalent data protections; </li>
    <li>Rosewood processes data complying with all applicable laws of the United States and other jurisdictions where it operates; this means Rosewood complies with laws requiring it to comply with legal process. </li>
