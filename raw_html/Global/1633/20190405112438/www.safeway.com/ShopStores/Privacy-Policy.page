However, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, we may disclose or transfer your personal information as described under the “Certain Business Transfers” section below. We may also share your personal information with our parent or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described in the “Our Use of Personal Information” section above.

<ul style="list-style-position: outside;">
<li>With Your Consent. We may disclose your personal information to third parties with your consent. You may give your consent in several ways, such as through a written agreement that you sign or acknowledge; an online method, such as a “click through” agreement or registration page; through a mobile application which you install on your mobile device or by enrolling in a text alert program; an oral statement, such as by way of an interactive voice response; or through the terms and conditions under which we provide you a particular product, service, or program. Sometimes your consent may be implicit. For example, if you purchase products with a credit card and have them shipped to your home, you implicitly consent to the disclosure of your name and address to a third-party shipping company to complete the delivery, and of your credit card number to the credit card processor to authorize the transaction and to the bank to collect payment.</li>
<br />
<li>Service Providers. We may disclose your personal information to third parties who complete transactions or perform services on our behalf or for your benefit. Information provided to such parties for payment authorization or verification purposes may be retained by them in a database that is used to provide similar services to others. We may also utilize the services of third parties to verify customer data, such as mailing addresses or to supplement other information we have collected. We may also contract with third parties to host a site, conduct market research, or send you information regarding our products or services or those of other companies with whom we conduct business.<br />
</li>
<br />
<li>Legal Process. We may disclose your personal information to legal or government regulatory authorities in response to their requests for such information or to assist in investigations of theft, fraud or abuse.

</li>
<br />
<li>Certain Business Transfers. Your personal information may be disclosed as part of a corporate business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, joint venture, or financing or sale of company assets, and could be transferred to a third party as one of the business assets in such a transaction. It may also be disclosed in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership.  We will use reasonable efforts to direct any such transferee to use your personal information in a manner that is consistent with our Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Health Information /Pharmacies</h3>
<p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties in the ordinary course of our business, nor do we disclose to them the personal information we collect for their own direct marketing purposes. However, upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions, we may disclose or transfer your personal information as described under the “Certain Business Transfers” section below. We may also share your personal information with our parent or affiliated companies for their use in a manner similar to the purposes described in the “Our Use of Personal Information” section above.

<p> </p>
<h3>Text Messaging Services</h3>
<p>When you sign up for one of our text messaging programs, you are expressly consenting to receive text messages on your cell phone or other mobile device about our products, services, and/or programs which may be sent by automated means. Text messages will only be sent to the mobile phone number used to opt into the applicable text message program. Some programs may send you up to the specified number of messages per month, dependent on the program, and each program in which you enroll will increase the total number of messages you receive each month. Details on how many messages you should expect to receive are provided at the time of enrollment. In some instances, you may have the opportunity to reply to a message, which may result in additional response messages. Your consent to enrollment in any text message program is not a condition of purchase. For information about a text message program you may text HELP to the applicable short code.</p>
<p>Message and data rates may apply. This means that your carrier may charge you for each message we send to you or that you send to us. It is your responsibility to know whether your carrier will charge you a per-message fee. We do not charge a fee for our text message programs and assume no responsibility for charges by your carrier you may incur when you sign up to receive text messages from us.</p>
<p>You may opt out of a text message program at any time by texting the word STOP to the applicable short code from an enrolled device. You will receive a final confirmation message that will confirm that you will no longer receive text messages from the applicable text message program unless you opt back into such program. Different instructions may apply to health care text messages related to our pharmacy services.</p>
