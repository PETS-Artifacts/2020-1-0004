  			<h1>Privacy and cookies</h1>
<p>At Samaritans we are committed to protecting your privacy. The purpose of this statement is to explain how Samaritans processes your data, whether you are using our service, interested in volunteering, making a donation or just browsing our website. </p>
<p>Samaritans is made up of 201 branches in the UK, the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, all of which are independent charities.  The branches are co-ordinated by Samaritans Central Charity.  Three branches within the branch network are not within the European Economic Area (EEA): Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey.  These branches are however on the European Commission’s “safe” list of countries for personal data exports.  The branches in the Crown Dependencies are subject to the same policies and procedures as branches in the UK and Republic of Ireland. </p>
<p>Samaritans takes appropriate technical and organisational measures to keep your data safe.  We do use “cloud-based” applications to process some types of personal data and data may be stored outside of the European Economic Area.  Where this happens we ask our suppliers to provide evidence that they have the appropriate measures in place to make sure that your data is secure.</p>
<p>As the service we provide changes, we may need to alter our privacy statement on the website. If you have any queries about this statement please contact the Data Protection Office at Samaritans, The Upper Mill, Kingston Road, Ewell, Surrey, KT17 2AF or email at <a href="mailto:dataprotection@samaritans.org">dataprotection@samaritans.org</a>.</p>

<p>Our service is designed so that the volunteer can’t see your phone number or email address when you contact us.  If we need to look into a call or series of calls (for example if you make a complaint), we can see calls made to Samaritans on our central system, but see an encrypted version of your phone number. </p>
<p>Please be aware that your telephone number will be visible if you contact Samaritans Central Office (as opposed to the helpline).</p>
<p>If we are concerned about you and want to offer you extra support, we may keep information you’ve given us to help us know it’s you when you call again and so we’re up to date with your situation. We share this information within Samaritans, because we work as a team to provide you with the best possible support.   An example of this is the setting up of assigned support; this is where we will arrange for volunteers to contact you at pre-arranged times.  This can be helpful if you find it difficult to go over previous conversations or if you are going through a particularity difficult time.   Assigned support is not open ended or long term, it is a temporary form of extra support and is only put in place with your input and agreement.</p>
<p>We’ll never pass any of this information on to any other organisation, except in the following situations:</p>
<ul><li>We receive a call about acts of terrorism or bomb warnings</li>
	<li>We receive a court order requiring us to share information</li>
	<li>We call an ambulance if during the course of a contact it appears that you are not able to make a decision for yourself.</li>
	<li>We are working in partnership with another organisation and you have given consent for your information to be shared</li>
	<li>You directly ask us to pass on information about you to someone else</li>
	<li>You threaten the safety of our volunteers</li>
	<li>You compromise the delivery of our service, for example by making it difficult for other people to get through, or by misusing telephony or other technology</li>
</ul><p>We also record some statistical information, to report on and improve our service. This includes information such as gender, and how distressed you were at the time you contacted us. This information never reports about specific people. We don’t record your phone calls to the helpline but volunteers and staff may from time to time listen in to calls for training, support, or research purposes.</p>
<p>We may contact you to offer our support if you are referred to us by another organisation or individual. Once we have contacted you we will destroy your contact details, unless you agree to further contact – in which case we will, with your consent, keep the contact details.</p>
<p>From time to time we have to take decisions to limit an individual’s access to the service.  If this happens, we will make every effort to inform you as to the reason why we have restricted your access.  For example we may ask you to give us a contact number so that a member of our Caller Support Team can call you to talk about your support needs.</p>
<p>If you contact us a lot in a short period of time we may get our system to limit the number of calls we will accept.  We do this to ensure that we can manage the capacity of our service.  The call limit is set bearing in mind that some callers need to contact us several times each day.  If this happens to you, you will get a message that explains how to contact us to discuss your needs.</p>
<p>If we believe you are abusing our service or are abusive towards volunteers, we may use our system to block your calls or messages from getting through. If you can’t get through by phone, you will hear a message that explains how to appeal the decision.  If you receive a message saying that we won’t respond to you, or you don’t receive an answer to an email or SMS message, you can appeal our decision. </p>
<p>In either of the above circumstances, we may limit or withdraw access to the service, as abuse towards volunteers is not acceptable and we cannot be in a position where your use of the service prevents Samaritans services being used by other people.  In extreme situations we may also involve the police.</p>

<h2><a name="complain" id="complain"></a>If you want to complain</h2>
<p>Samaritans aims to support our callers to the highest possible standard at all times. To help achieve this, we encourage anyone who is not completely happy with the service they have received to let us know immediately, either by contacting the branch involved or Central Charity (contact details below). All complaints will be investigated fully.  </p>
<p>It is important that you give as much information as possible in order to fully investigate your complaint. Your information will not be passed on to anyone outside of Samaritans. So we can effectively handle a complaint, we will in most cases need to involve  the Director of the branch involved to contact you directly.  This is done with your prior consent, so that we resolve the complaint.</p>
<p>It is our aim to resolve a complaint within 14 days of receiving it. In some cases, this isn’t possible but we will do our best to resolve it as soon as we can.</p>
<p>If you wish to, <a href="/feedback/complaints-questionnaire">you can use the Complaints questionnaire here</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or wish to add information concerning your complaint, please contact a member of the Quality Team on +44(0)20 8394 8300 or email <a href="mailto:feedback@samaritans.org">feedback@samaritans.org</a>. Please be aware that your telephone number will be visible to the Quality Team and may be logged for administrative purposes.</p>

<h2><a name="volunteer" id="volunteer"></a>If you would like to volunteer with Samaritans</h2>
<p>Samaritans Central Charity works with branches to support the recruitment and management of volunteers across both Central Charity and branches.  It processes volunteer data in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>If you contact Samaritans about volunteering </strong></p>
<p>If you are interesting in volunteering with Samaritans, you will be asked to give us your personal details.  Most people contact us through our website (<a href="http://www.samaritans.org">www.samaritans.org</a>), however you can also enquire via the telephone, post, email, or at events.  You can also contact branches directly. <a href="/branches">Find your nearest branch here</a>.</p>
<p>If you contact Samaritans Central Charity, we will pass this information on to your local Samaritans branch or the branch you have requested.  The branch will then contact you about volunteering at the branch. </p>
<p>Samaritans Central Charity will also use this information to allow us to monitor requests for volunteering, assist you with any queries you might have regarding your volunteering application and ask you about your experience of applying to volunteer with us. </p>
<p>We ask for information about age, disability, gender, employment status and ethnicity to help us with equal opportunities monitoring.  You are not required to give us this information, but by choosing to do so you consent to the processing of this information by us. </p>
<p><strong>If you apply to be a volunteer at a branch</strong></p>
<p>Applications to volunteer need to be made to individual branches.  Your local branch will explain how you can do this.     </p>
<p>The branch may share some of the information that you give in  the application form with Central Charity.  It may also share information from your referees and the criminal records disclosure.  Information about you from a third party will only be used with your knowledge. </p>
<p>The information provided will be used to make a decision about whether you will be accepted on to a Samaritans’ training course.   </p>
<p><strong>Sharing information outside of Samaritans</strong></p>
<p>Samaritans will keep your personal information confidential, unless we are required to disclose it in connection with a police investigation and/or we have reason to believe that you may present a risk of harm to others.</p>
<p>At your request we will provide a reference. </p>
<h2><a name="donate" id="donate"></a>If you donate to Samaritans</h2>
<p>When you donate money to Samaritans, we may collect and process information about you. This information may include your financial details, name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Some of this information may come from external sources.</p>
<p>We may use your information for a number of purposes including:</p>
<ul><li>To process donations you have made;</li>
	<li>If you have consented we will update you about our work and activities.  From time to time these updates may include requests for financial support </li>
	<li>For administration purposes (for example, we may contact you regarding a donation you have made or the event you have registered for);</li>
	<li>For internal record keeping, including the management of any feedback or complaints;</li>
	<li>To invite you to participate in surveys or research (this is voluntary).</li>
</ul><p>When you make a donation via our website, the data is stored on a secure server. We also take appropriate measures to ensure the information disclosed to us is kept protected and up to date.  You can also donate to Samaritans via a number of online providers such as PayPal, Virgin Money Giving or Just Giving websites (separate privacy statements apply).  You may also donate directly to a branch through their branch pages on this website. </p>
<p>You can donate to Samaritans via your mobile phone either on a one-off basis or through a monthly subscription service.  <a href="/legal/text-donate-terms-and-conditions">Click here for our text-to-donate T&amp;Cs</a>, which explain how to opt-out of further text or phone communication from us. We work with a supplier to provide and administer the text-to-donate service, and calls about this service including how to opt out of calls or texts, will be routed through this supplier (<a href="/legal/text-donate-terms-and-conditions">see our text-to-donate T&amp;Cs for details</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Marketing communications</strong></p>
<p>If you donate to us, we will ask you if we can stay in touch and keep you up to date with our fundraising activities and the work of the charity.  We will also ask you how you would like us to stay in touch – by mail, telephone, email or text message. </p>
<ul><li>If you have given us your postal address, we may send you direct mail by post unless you have told us that you would prefer not to receive information in this way</li>
	<li>If you have given us your telephone number, we may telephone you about our work unless you have told us that you prefer not to be contacted in this way.</li>
	<li>If you are registered with the Telephone Preference Service, we will only call you if you have told us that you are happy to receive telephone calls from us.</li>
	<li>If we are contacting you by email or text, we will tell you how you can opt out of further communications.</li>
</ul><p>We work with some event / challenge organisers who collect your personal information as part of the registration process.  If you have consented to contact from Samaritans as part of registration, your contact details will be passed to us and we will contact you as referenced by the third party supplier.</p>
<p><sharing p="" personal="" your=""></sharing></p>
<p>From time to time, Samaritans works with fundraising agencies, which provide data processing services.  For example, this may be a fundraising telemarketing agency who will call on our behalf or a company that provides printing and postage services to send postal communications to our supporters.</p>
<p>In such cases we may share your personal information with these suppliers.  When we do this, we do not give these organisations any rights to use your personal information (or contact you) except in accordance with our instructions. We also require these third parties to comply with Data Protection legislation, and we make sure that appropriate safeguards are in place.</p>
<p>Where personal information is passed from Samaritans to our contracted suppliers, this is transferred securely and is only used for the specific purpose as confirmed by our contract with them.</p>
<p>If you have made a Gift Aid declaration, we may disclose the information you have provided as part of the declaration to HMRC for the purpose of reclaiming Gift Aid on your donation(s).</p>
<p>We not share or sell personal information to third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant activity. If you have indicated that you do not wish to be contacted, we will retain your details on a suppression list to help ensure that we do not continue to contact you.</p>
<p><strong>Keeping your information up to date</strong></p>
<p>If you have provided us with your details, but decide at a later date that you no longer want to receive information from us or your personal details have changed, simply let our Supporter Care Team know by contacting them at:</p>

<p><a name="research" id="research"></a><span style="font-size: 1.385em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.538em;">Research at Samaritans</span></p>
<p>Samaritans undertakes research into suicide and self-harm, effective ways of providing support to people in distress and the needs and experiences of people using our services.  We use this to inform the development of our service and our work to influence government policy.</p>
<p>As well as the policies for the protection of data set out above, Samaritans has a <a href="/sites/default/files/kcfinder/files/research/Samaritans%20Research%20Ethics%20Policy%202013.pdf">Research Ethics Policy</a> which applies to all research that involves contacting and collating information from current or past callers, volunteers and members of the general public and is carried out by Samaritans staff or volunteers, or external research teams that are supported or commissioned by the charity.</p>
<p>As per the Research Ethics Policy, informed consent is required for all activities that involve contact between researchers (whether Samaritans staff or from an external institution) and research participants. This means that participants must be fully informed about the project, including how any data provided will be used and the degree of anonymity and confidentiality provided, before agreeing to take part and must provide written consent.</p>
<p>All electronic and hard copy data collected during research is stored securely and is accessible only to designated researchers and for the purposes of the research.</p>
<p>From time to time the research team uses externally hosted websites to conduct surveys. These websites may be sited in countries or jurisdictions which do not provide the same level of data protection as the UK. Surveys contain information at the beginning about the purpose of research and how the data will be used, and participants are required to indicate that they consent to take part before they proceed to complete the survey. This information includes the fact that the website hosting the survey is outside of the UK, so by participating in the survey, they are providing  written consent to the transfer of any data they provide, including any personal details and sensitive personal data such as information about their emotional wellbeing. </p>
<p>Complaints about research should be directed to the researcher leading the project or to the Head of Policy and Research at Samaritans, The Upper Mill, Kingston Road, Ewell, Surrey, KT17 2AF</p>

You can also sign up to hear more about Samaritans’ campaigning through our website. In both these cases we will ask you to give us your name and email address and we may ask for other personal data depending on the context. If you sign up to our monthly e-newsletter or to receive information about our campaigning, we will send you a confirmation email and registration for the newsletter will not be completed until you confirm.</p>

<p><strong>How to unsubscribe from receiving emails </strong></p>
<p>Should you wish to stop receiving emails from us, you can unsubscribe directly through an Unsubscribe link provided within every Samaritans email. It is usually located at the bottom of the email.

<p>Samaritans uses MailChimp, which is a web based email service provider. MailChimp does not use cookies to track our subscribers. Links and images are used to track / open and clicks for campaigns. Our emails use email tracking technology, as almost all emails do, to help provide you with the best experience we can. The technology places an invisible single pixel gif image (also called a web beacon) in emails to detect when they have been opened and when links within emails have been clicked. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type and other similar details. We use this data to create reports about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links and this information helps us to improve our email content so you receive more useful and relevant information from us.</p>
