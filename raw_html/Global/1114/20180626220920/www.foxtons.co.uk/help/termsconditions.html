<p><b>Anti-Money Laundering</b></p>

<p>Foxtons is committed to operating its business in a transparent and open manner consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations.  We are aware that the real estate industry is a target for organised criminals seeking to launder the proceeds of criminal activity.  We always seek to prevent this activity by cooperating fully with the authorities and reporting suspicious activity to the National Crime Agency.</p>

<p>As part of this commitment, we adopt a strict compliance of all Anti-Money Laundering rules, with specific emphasis on the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Money Laundering Regulations 2017, the Bribery Act 2010 and the Terrorism Act 2000.</p>

<p>Foxtons policy commitment is applicable to all of our customers, including vendors, buyers, landlords and tenants.  As a result we obtain and hold for a period of at least seven years evidence pertaining to our customers' identity and, where appropriate, we obtain proof of ownership of property and source/destination of funds.  We will be unable to proceed with any work on behalf of our customers if we are unable to obtain this information.  Customers' identity will be subject to an electronic identity check, which may also include a credit check.</p>

<p>For a full list of acceptable identity documents, please <a href="/help/aml-documents.html">click here</a></p>

<p>Foxtons is registered and supervised by HM Revenue & Customs for compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2017.</p>

<h4>5.	DATA SECURITY</h4>

<p>Once we have received your personal data we will use reasonable and necessary procedures and security features to try and prevent unauthorised access.  For example, we limit who can access your personal data to those individuals and third parties who need to know it and who are subject to a duty of confidentiality.  If we become aware of a data breach we will notify the Information Commissioner's Office.  If we believe that the data breach is serious, we may notify you in accordance with our legal requirements.</p>

<h4>6.	INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS </h4>

<p>We will not transfer your personal data outside of the European Economic Area, except to a country offering the same level of protection for your personal data.  For example, with certain service providers we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which ensures that your personal data has the same protection as it would have in Europe.</p>

<h4>7.	DATA RETENTION</h4>

<p>We hold on to your personal data whilst you use our services (or whilst we provide services connected to you) and for at least seven years thereafter, for legal, regulatory and accounting purposes.  If we need to hold on to your personal data for longer, we take into consideration the potential risks in continuing to store your data against why we might need to keep it.  In some circumstances we might anonymise your personal data so it is not associated with you, and we may then use this information indefinitely. </p>

<h4>8.	YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h4>

<p>Under data protection laws you have the right to protect and look after your personal data.  You have the right to:</p>

<ul class="default">
	<li>ask us for the personal data that we hold and process about you (this is commonly known as a data subject access request).  You have rights to the following information:
