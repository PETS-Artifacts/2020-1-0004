<h3>Anti-Money Laundering</h3>

<p>Foxtons is committed to operating its business in a transparent and open manner consistent with our legal and regulatory obligations. We are aware that the real estate industry is a target for organised criminals seeking to launder the proceeds of criminal activity. We always seek to prevent this activity by cooperating fully with the authorities and reporting suspicious activity to National Crime Agency. </p>

<p>As part of this commitment we adopt a strict compliance of all applicable Anti Money Laundering rules, with specific emphasis on the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, the Bribery Act 2010 and the Terrorism Act 2000. </p>

<p>Foxtons policy commitment is applicable to all our customers, including vendors, buyers, landlords and tenants. As a result we obtain and hold for a period of at least five years evidence pertaining to our customers' identity and, where appropriate, we obtain proof of ownership of property and source/ destination of funds. We will be unable to proceed with any work on behalf of our customers if we are unable to obtain this information.  Customers' identity will be subject to an electronic identity check, which may also include a credit check. </p>

<p>For a full list of acceptable identity documents, please <a href="/help/aml-documents.html">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Foxtons is registered and supervised by HM Revenue &amp; Customs for compliance with the Money Laundering Regulations 2007.</p>

<p>Foxtons respect and value the security and privacy of those of its contacts. Foxtons follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information in order to prevent unauthorised access. Personal Data is held on our contacts and administration database either because of work we have undertaken or are currently engaged in, or because we believe that clients may be interested in receiving material from us about our business and services. As such we hold client contact details and the history of our client relationship. This allows us to manage our client relationships effectively and target items of interest so that you do not receive unwanted material through the post.</p>

<p>In accordance with your rights under the Act, you may request the amendment of the personal information held or to cease receiving direct marketing materials. Foxtons does not sell, rent or deal in the personal information we hold. Information may, in the ordinary course of business, move between Foxtons, its associated companies and to our contractors, which may involve the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area.</p>
