The information we collect includes personally identifiable information, such as your name, home address, billing address, shipping address, telephone number, and email address, and social media account ID. You may also provide non-personally identifiable information, for example, demographic information, such as gender and date of birth, or the name of your employer or school. You can also provide demographic information, such as gender and date of birth.&#160;</p>

<li>For children enrolled in Kid’s Club: we collect from the parent/legal guardian, &#160;the name, date of birth, parent/legal guardian contact information, list of known allergies, and physical description (hair and eye color)</li>
</ul>

<p>During the My24 online account creation process you will select a user name and password. If you purchase any products or services through our Digital Properties we collect your credit card or debit card number and related information, as applicable.&#160;</p>

<p>We collect information from you when you purchase a membership and other services from us, including when you use our My24 mobile app to purchase a membership and other services. &#160;If you sign up for a free day pass to our clubs, you will provide us your name, email address and telephone number, as well as non-personally identifiable information including your birthdate.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.2 <b>Log Information We Collect from You Automatically.</b> &#160;We collect certain information automatically as you use our &#160;Digital Properties, including your IP (Internet Protocol) address, browser type, computer type, type of mobile device (if used), the carrier for your mobile device, your computer operating system, the version of the Digital Properties that you access, the site from where you navigated to our Digital Properties, time and date of using the Digital Properties, whether you are a repeat visitor, how long you use the Digital Properties and the pages on or using our Digital Properties that you view. This information is anonymous, and we do not link it to your personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.3 <b>Cookies</b>. &#160;When you visit or use our Digital Properties we send one or more “cookies” to your computer or other device. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, tracking user trends and providing relevant advertising to you based on your activities on the Digital Properties and on other websites. To learn more, please see Section 4.2, below. At this time we do not respond to browser 'do not track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.4 <b>Pixel Tags.</b> &#160;We may use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML capable email, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.5 <b>Physical Location.</b> &#160;We may collect the physical location of your device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals or your IP address. We may use your device’s physical location to provide you with location-based services and content. &#160;We may also share your device’s physical location, combined with information about what advertisements you viewed and other information we collect, with our marketing service providers to enable them to provide you with more localized content and to study the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. &#160;You may be able to allow or deny such uses and/or sharing of your device’s location by changing your device’s location settings, but if you choose to deny such uses and/or sharing, we and our marketing service providers may not be able to provide you with the location-based services and content.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.6 <b>Other Sources.</b> We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, commercially available sources, social networks, and other third parties. &#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2.7 <b>Aggregated Information.</b> We may aggregate personally identifiable information. &#160;Aggregated information is not personally identifiable information because it does not identify and is not associated with you or any other user of our Digital Properties.</p>

<hr />
<h3>3. How We Use Your Information</h3>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3.1 <b>To Provide Products, Services, and Information.</b> As described above, we collect information from you so that we can provide products and services that you purchase using the Digital Properties and information that you request from us.

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3.4 <b>Advertising.</b> &#160;We use your information to provide advertisements and promotional information relating to products and services that we provide or otherwise offer for sale. We use cookies to track your activity on our Digital Properties so we can provide this advertising to you.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3.5 <b>Our Business Purposes.</b> We may use your information for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, fraud monitoring and prevention, developing new products and services, enhancing, improving or modifying our Digital Properties, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and operating and expanding our business activities.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;3.6 <b>Other Purposes.</b> We may use non-personally identifiable information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. &#160;In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (such as associating your name with your employer if you are a participant in a corporate sponsored program), in which case we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information as long as it is combined. &#160;</p>

<hr />
<h3>4. How We Share Your Information</h3>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4.1 <b>Our Third Party Service Providers</b>.

<p>We may provide your personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, and a record of any transactions you conduct on our Digital Properties or offline with us, to third-party advertising companies and their service providers to display online advertising that may be of interest to you.</p>

<p>You can learn about these advertising practices and your choices in connection with them by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance’s (DAA) consumer information page at www.aboutads.info and the Network Advertising Initiative’s (NAI) opt-out page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. &#160;The DAA and NAI are self-regulatory organizations that provide educational content and opt-out tools to help Internet users learn about and exercise choice with respect to online interest-based advertising practices.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4.3 <b>Legal Requests or Requirements and to Prevent Harm.</b> &#160;We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our &#160;Digital Properties. &#160;We may also share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to prevent harm to 24 Hour Fitness, the Digital Properties, our members or other individuals.&#160;This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts, or other government entities.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4.4 <b>Sharing by You.</b> If you post comments, information or other materials on our message boards, blogs, social media pages or other services, please note that any information you post or disclose through these services will become public information and may be available to users of the Digital Properties and to the general public. &#160;We urge you to be very careful when deciding to disclose your personally identifiable information, or any other information, on the Digital Properties.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4.5 <b>Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control. &#160;</b>If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the &#160;Digital Properties to a third party, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the new owner to be used consistent with this Privacy Policy. &#160;</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;4.6 <b>Other Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</b> We may share non-personally identifiable information with third parties for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. &#160;In some instances, we may combine non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information (such as associating your name with your employer if you are a participant in a corporate sponsored program), in which case we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information as long as it is combined.</p>

<h3>6. Security of Your Information</h3>

<p>We use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures to protect your information. Our employees have access to your personally identifiable information only on a need to know basis. Contracts with our third party service providers require them to keep information confidential. Sensitive data (such as a credit card number) is protected by SSL encryption when it is transmitted between your web browser and our Digital Properties. However, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Questions” section above.</p>

<p>Please note that emails you send to us through our Digital Properties are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these mean</p>
