    information, personally identified information or in aggregated form, about your participation in
    specific  programs to the program sponsor or their representatives.  This helps our industry
    sponsors to improve clinical education and information and communicate with you in a more

    apply.

    under contract not to use Personal Information supplied by us other than to provide the services requested by
    us and to guarantee to our satisfaction that they have sufficient processes in place to ensure the
    security of your data whilst it is in their care.  You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal
    Information with our contractors and third party service supplies for the purpose of providing
    services to you.

    <p>In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide
    lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Haymarket products
    to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies send
    on Haymarket's behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to
    our own list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be
    supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you
    continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at

    </p>
    <p>We use advertising companies to develop banner ads for our Digital Offering.
    These ads may contain cookies. These companies collect cookies sent to your

    Like many websites, Haymarket may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons,
    spotlight tags or web bugs, to improve our understanding of site traffic,
    visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns, as a supplement to our
    server logs and other methods of traffic and response measurement. Pixel tags
    are sometimes used in conjunction with small Javascript-based applications, also
    for the purpose of traffic measurement. We may also implement pixel tags
    provided by other companies, for the same purpose. You can disable pixel tags by
    changing your browser settings to omit images and disable Javascript; or there
    are commercial software packages available that can omit pixel tags and most
    advertisements.
