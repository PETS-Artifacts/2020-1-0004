    <a name="Protect"></a>Protect yourself when applying for jobs
</h2>
<p>There are thousands of genuine job vacancies posted every day on the jobactive website. However recently we have seen an increase in fake employers posting false job ads on the jobactive website. They may also email you directly through the Find Candidates feature of the website.</p>
<p>While we are vigilant in tracking down and removing false employers, it&rsquo;s important for you to protect yourself. Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Never give your bank or credit card details when applying for a job</li>
    <li>Never provide your date of birth</li>
    <li>Do not pay job application fees</li>
    <li>Do not give out your Driver&rsquo;s Licence or passport information</li>
    <li>Check if the job is genuine (if possible) by researching the employer online or calling them before applying</li>
</ul>
<p>If something doesn&rsquo;t seem right, you can report fake job ads by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>using the &lsquo;Report This Job facility&rsquo; available on all vacancies</li>
    <li>
        sending any relevant details to <a href="mailto:ajsfeedback@cc.employment.gov.au" title="Email">ajsfeedback@cc.employment.gov.au</a>; or
    </li>
    <li>calling the Job Seeker Hotline on 13 62 68</li>
</ul>

Agreement by either the current jobactive Provider or the chosen Provider is not required. This functionality is only available for Job Seekers participating in jobactive, excluding:<ul>
        <li>pre-release prisoners</li>
        <li>Job Seekers who have had a Level 3 Incident Report within the last 12 months and</li>
        <li>Job Seekers with a sensitive record.</li>
    </ul><h3>Job Seeker privacy</h3>
<p>94. No personal details about you will be shown to Employers through the website unless you choose to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>include them in your resume and choose to forward this resume via the website and/or</li>
    <li>set your Career Profile Privacy status to &lsquo;Visible &ndash; Registered Employers Only&rsquo; allowing Employers to search for you and view your career profile, and Employment Services Providers to search for you, view your career profile and Resume(s)</li>
    <li>set your Career Profile Privacy status to &lsquo;Visible - Public&rsquo; allowing your Employment Services Provider to directly send Employers a public link to your career profile. Any Employers who receive the link will be able to view your career profile.</li>
</ul><p>Otherwise your identity will remain anonymous.</p><p>95. If you are registered with an Employment Services Provider and have a sensitive Job Seeker record (for example, you are under witness protection) your personal details will not be displayed on the website and cannot be viewed by any other parties.</p><p>96. Information you provide on the website, including but not limited to, your resumes, cover letters, applications and job matches may be made available to your Employment Services Provider for the purpose of assisting you to find employment. Employment Services Providers are bound by contract to protect your privacy in regard to any information you put on the website.</p><p>97. The website will not provide you with the names of Employers who may have accessed your career profile online.</p><p>98. The information you include in your Personal Event on the website Calendar function, may be viewed by your Employment Services Provider. Your Employment Services Provider may choose to book appointments which coincide with other appointments/events if necessary.</p><p>99. Further information on Privacy can be found in the Privacy Statement on the website.</p>
<h3>Connecting with Jobfit</h3><p>100. Job seekers registered on the jobactive website who have a Jobfit account can connect their two accounts together. The connection will involve entering your Jobfit email address and password on the jobactive website and submitting it for validation. Where validation is successful a connection is established which will allow for job applications submitted on the jobactive website or the Job Seeker app, to automatically flow across to your Jobfit account and award you points, without having to log the tasks in Jobfit separately. Job matching and job alerts set in the jobactive website will also send points to your Jobfit account, where you have established a connection between your two accounts.</p>
<h3>Job Seeker accounts</h3><p>101. If you are a Public Job Seeker (i.e. you registered on the website without the help of an Employment Services Provider) you are able to access your account while it remains linked to your myGov account. Your account will remain available should you unlink it from your myGov account, however, you will need to relink it to myGov to access it.</p><p>102. If you are a Private Job Seeker (i.e. your account was created as part of your registration with an Employment Services Provider) your account will be made inactive after you are exited from employment services. You will still have access to your account while it remains linked to your myGov account.</p><p>103. The Department and Employment Service Providers (where applicable) may access inactive accounts for auditing purposes, program assurance and the finalisation of outstanding claims.</p>
<h3>Retention of Job Seeker accounts</h3><p>104. If you are a Private Job Seeker, as required by law, your account must be retained by the Department for at least three (3) years after it was last actioned, however, for record keeping purposes your account may not be removed from the Department&#39;s IT system.</p>
