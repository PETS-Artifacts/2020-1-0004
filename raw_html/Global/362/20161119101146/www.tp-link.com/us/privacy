<h2><a name="sec_a">Privacy</a></h2>

<p>We at TP-LINK take your privacy seriously. Your use or access of the Services (as defined in the Terms of Use) in any manner serves as your acknowledgement that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy (this &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;). You further hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information pursuant to this Policy. Your use of our Services is always subject to our Terms of Use, which includes this Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers how we treat &ldquo;Personal Information,&rdquo; which is personally identifiable information that you share with us, and that we collect during your use of our Services. This Policy does not and cannot cover the practices of companies, third parties, and individuals that we do not own or control, or people that we do not manage. During your use of the Services, we will gather Personal Information from our users and will use this information in connection with the Services. The information is used to deliver the basic functionality of the Services, to offer personalization of the Services, to contact you or have other users contact you, to analyze how you use the Services, to allow you to create, modify, and view your account information, and to allow you to customize, rate, and review the Services. In certain cases as defined below, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties.</p>

<p>Please see the Terms of Use as it relates to individuals under the age of 13.</p>

<h3>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>This Policy may change at any time as we improve and change our Services. In the event that we need to change the Services, we will place a notice in this Policy and may also send you an email. If you do not agree with the terms of the updated Policy, you may reject them. However, you may not use the Services thereafter. Your continued use of the Service after a change of the Policy means that you agree to all of the changes.</p>

<h3>INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3>

<p>We receive and store the information you knowingly provide to us. During account registration or account update, this can include your name, email address, shipping and billing address, mobile, home, work phone numbers, credit card information or credit card processing information, names you give to your locations, geo-fenced location, names of users for your account, device names, device location names, device group names, scene names, device images, location images, user images, device configuration details, third party account credentials, schedules for devices or groups, and names of schedules.</p>

<h3>THIRD PARTY SERVICES</h3>

<p>Some third party services that you choose to integrate with the Services may transmit Personal Information into your account with us. You authorize that such &ldquo;Third Party Information&rdquo; is covered under this Policy and we may use it just as we use your Personal Information. This information may include but is not limited to, for example, account credentials, names, avatars, profile information, configuration information, images, and linked users (e.g. friends).</p>

<h3>CONTACTING YOU</h3>

<p>We may use any means that you have provided us to contact you. This may include the email address you use to register for and log in to your account. We may contact you in order to notify you of changes to this Policy or the Terms of Use, changes or updates to the Services, promotional offers, Service information or use case ideas, or user surveys. You may also receive various confirmations about the messages we send to you such as if you receive, open, or delete an email from us. These confirmations help us to improve the way we communicate with you. You may choose to stop receiving communication of the type in each email using the unsubscribe function at the bottom of the email. Some messages that are critical to Service functionality, such as Forgot Password emails and Email Confirmation emails, may not be able to be unsubscribed from.</p>

<h3>AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Some information is automatically collected as you use the Services. For example, when you connect hardware devices or third party services to your Account, those hardware devices may report usage information to the Services and the Services may read, process, and store this information for the purposes described above. Such information is usually associated with the usage of the particular hardware device or third party service, such as when a motion sensor senses motion. The Services will receive information about the device activation, as well as the information that you have chosen to associate with the device or service such as device name, group name, and location name. The type of the device or service from which information is received will change the types and quantities of information that is received.</p>

<p>Other information automatically collected may include your IP address, location, mobile device information, operating system, browser type, demographic information, application information, click-through paths, identity of pages you&rsquo;re interacting with, time spent on those pages, and other information associated with how you interact with the pages and Services. We may transfer &quot;Cookies&quot; to your device when you interact with the Services. These Cookies allow us to recognize your device and browser, and keep track of how you interact with the pages of the Services. Your device or browser may allow you to limit your acceptance of Cookies; however, this may prevent proper functionality of the Services and may prevent you from interacting with the Services in certain ways. Third party services may transfer Cookies to your device and/or use existing Cookies on your device. We do not and cannot control third party use of Cookies.</p>

<h3>PRIVACY SETTINGS</h3>

<p>With simple controls in apps and Web management page&#39;s &#39;Privacy settings&#39;, you can turn on or off different types of information collection, such as TP-LINK Cloud services and Tether usage stats in Tether app.</p>

<p>Please note that some features may not function with certain privacy settings turned off, and some information (such as the association of your TP-LINK Cloud account to your Tether) is stored by TP-LINK even if all privacy controls are turned off.</p>

<h3>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Your Personal Information may be provided to our partners for use in their promotional and/or marketing practices. This information will be anonymized so that you will not be personally identifiable by the information. We may also aggregate the anonymized information and provide it for our partners so they may use it to determine and understand how people interact with and use our Services. We will not disclose aggregated information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual, except as outlined below.</p>

<p>We may provide anonymized, aggregated Personal Information for advertisers so that they may select an appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or promotions. Thus you agree that we may provide any information we have received from you in a non-personally identifiable manner for those advertisers. While we will not tell businesses who you are, we may tell advertisers that you are located in New York so that they may show you advertisements or offers for New York businesses. As another example, we may tell advertisers that you have a device called &ldquo;Pool Light,&rdquo; so that they may deliver you advertisements or offers for pool cleaning services.</p>

<p>We may deliver a web beacon file from an ad network to you through the Services. The web beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated auditing, research, and reporting for us and for advertisers and allow ad networks to serve targeted advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from the ad network&#39;s servers, these companies can view, edit, or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site.</p>

<h3>AT THE EVENT OF CHANGE OF CONTROL</h3>

<p>TP-LINK may elect to buy or sell assets. When buying or selling assets, customer information is often one of the assets that may be transferred. Personal Information may also be transferred or acquired by a third party in the event that TP-LINK is acquired, enters bankruptcy, or goes through some other change of control.</p>

<p>Please be advised that, we may disclose information that you have provided us if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; or (b) protect and defend the rights and property of TP-LINK or others; in any event, we will disclose information only in accordance with applicable regulations.</p>

<h3>SECURITY</h3>

<p>Your account&rsquo;s privacy and security is protected by your password. In order to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information, you should select a strong password and protect it by limiting access to your computer or device and browser or application and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. If you use a third party service to sign into your account, you should protect that account accordingly as well.</p>

<p>While we strive to always protect the privacy of your account and Personal Information in our records, we cannot always guarantee it will be completely secure. The security of your Personal Information may be compromised by unauthorized entry, unauthorized use, hardware failure, software failure, and other factors at any time.</p>

<h3>STORING YOUR INFORMATION</h3>

<p>Using the Services, you can access and may be able to edit or remove the Personal Information you have provided to us. The information you can access through the Services may change as the Services themselves change. When you change information, however, we may maintain a copy of the original information in our records. Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of information from your account. Additionally, we may use any anonymized or aggregated data that incorporates or is derived from your Personal Information after you update or delete it; however we will not do so in a way that identifies you personally.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</h3>

<p>Per California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents who have an established business relationship with us are entitled to ask us to identify the kinds of Personal Information we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and provide contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like this information, please submit a written request to:</p>

<h3>Children&#39;s Privacy</h3>

<p>The Children&#39;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&quot;COPPA&quot;) prohibits online service providers from knowingly collecting personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13 without parental consent.

<h3>User Content Submissions</h3>

We shall call this &ldquo;Personal Submissions.&rdquo; In addition, when you connect various hardware peripherals, third-party services, or applications with the Services, those items will often provide information or data for the Services.

<p>TP-LINK does not endorse and has no control over any Personal Submission. You acknowledge that you access all content by using the Services and provide all Personal Submissions at your own risk and you will be solely responsible for any damage or loss to any party resulting therefrom.</p>

<p>Any and all information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated. You access all such information and content at your own risk. We are not liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and/or use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content.

In the event that we elect to terminate your account, we will try to provide advance notice to you prior to termination so that you are able to retrieve any important Content stored in your account. You understand and agree that we may provide no advanced notice for any reason, but usually because it would be impractical, illegal, not in the interest of someone&#39;s safety or security, or otherwise harmful to the rights or property of TP-LINK.</p>
