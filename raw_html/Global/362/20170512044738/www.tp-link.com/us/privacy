<h2><a name="sec_a">Privacy</a></h2>

<p>TP-Link (&ldquo;TP-Link&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, or &ldquo;our&rdquo;) takes your privacy seriously. &nbsp;Your use or access of our website(s), products, services, mobile applications, and other software (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) in any manner serves as your acknowledgement that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy (this &ldquo;Policy&rdquo;). &nbsp;You further hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information pursuant to this Policy. &nbsp;Your use of our Services is also subject to our Terms of Use, which incorporates this Policy.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers how we treat personal information, which is personally identifiable information that you share with us, and that we collect during your use of our Services. &nbsp;This Policy does not and cannot cover the practices of companies, third parties, and individuals that we do not own or control, or people that we do not manage.</p>

<p><strong>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>

<p>This Policy may change at any time as we improve and change our Services. &nbsp;We may notify you by updating the Policy&rsquo;s effective date below.&nbsp; If there are material changes in the way we treat personal information we will place a prominent notice on this website.&nbsp; You should check this website frequently for updates. &nbsp;Prior versions of this Policy will be kept in an archive for your review and are accessible <a href="http://www.tp-link.com/us/privacy-old.html" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp; If you do not agree with the terms of the updated Policy, you must stop using the Services. &nbsp;Your continued use of the Service after any Policy changes means that you agree to the updated Policy.</p>

<p><strong>SOURCES AND CATEGORIES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</strong></p>

<p><strong>Information You Knowingly Provide to Us</strong></p>

<p>We receive and store the information you knowingly provide to us. When you register or update your account, make a purchase online, or otherwise interact with the Services, you may provide us personal information such as your name, email address, shipping and billing address, mobile, home, and work phone numbers, and credit card information.&nbsp; You may also provide other information that potentially could be used to identify you, such as the names and images that you associate with your locations, account users, devices, scenes, device configuration details, third-party account credentials, schedules and audio recordings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Information We Receive from Third-Parties</strong></p>

<p>Some third-party services that you choose to integrate with the Services may transmit personal information into your account with us. You authorize that such third-party information is covered under this Policy and we may use it just as we use the information we collect directly from you. &nbsp;This information may include, but is not limited to, account credentials, names, avatars, profile information, configuration information, images, and linked users (e.g., friends).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may also voluntarily provide your personal information to us via third-party service providers that help us operate our Services.</p>

<p><strong>Information We Collect Automatically </strong></p>

<p>Some information is automatically collected as you use the Services. &nbsp;For example, when you connect hardware devices or third-party services to your account, those hardware devices may report usage information to the Services and the Services may read, process, and store this information for the purposes described in this policy. &nbsp;Such information is usually associated with the usage of the particular hardware device or third-party service, such as when a motion sensor senses motion. &nbsp;The Services will receive information about the device activation, as well as the information that you have chosen to associate with the device or service such as device name, group name, and location name. &nbsp;The type of the device or service from which information is received will change the types and quantities of information that is received.</p>

<p>Other information automatically collected may include your IP address, location, mobile device information, operating system, browser type, demographic information, application information, URL information such as click-through paths, identity of pages you interact with, time spent on those pages, and other information associated with how you interact with the pages and Services. &nbsp;</p>

<p>We may transfer &ldquo;cookies&rdquo; to your device when you interact with the Services. &nbsp;These cookies allow us to recognize your device and browser, and keep track of how you interact with the pages of the Services. &nbsp;For more information about cookies and your ability to limit or remove cookies, please see the Your Choices section below.</p>

<p><strong>HOW WE USE THE PERSONAL INFORMATION </strong></p>

<p>During your use of the Services, we will gather personal information from our users and will use this information in connection with the Services as follows:</p>

<p><strong>To Provide Our Services and Contact You</strong></p>

<p>We use personal information to deliver the basic functionality of the Services; provide functionality to certain features that you choose to use; allow you to create, modify, and view your account information; and allow you to customize, rate, and review the Services. &nbsp;We may use any means that you have provided us to contact you, such as the email address you use to register for and log in to your account. We may contact you in order to respond to your requests and to provide you information about your account. &nbsp;We may also use personal information to process claims we receive in connection with the Services. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To Market and Improve Our Services and for Other Legitimate Business Interests</strong></p>

<p>We may use personal information to personalize the Services; analyze how you use the Services; and communicate promotional offers, special events, user surveys, and other marketing communications with your consent when this is required under applicable law. In certain cases as described below, we may also share some personal information with third parties for these purposes. See the Your Choices section below for information about how you can opt-out of certain communications.</p>

<p><strong>To Comply with Applicable Laws and Our Policies</strong></p>

<p>We use personal information to comply with our legal obligations and our policies; establish, exercise or defend a legal claim; protect against, identify and prevent fraud, criminal liability and other liabilities; and monitor and report compliance issues.</p>

<p><strong>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Corporate Family</strong></p>

<p>We may share the information we collect about you with our corporate family, including our affiliates and subsidiaries.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other Entities with Your Consent</strong></p>

<p>Some third-party services that you choose to integrate with the Services may receive personal information from your account. &nbsp;You authorize us to transmit your personal information to third parties when you choose to integrate their services with our Services. &nbsp;Information collected by such third-party services is subject to their own terms and policies.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers and Other Third-Parties</strong></p>

<p>Your personal information may be provided to our partners for use in their promotional and/or marketing practices. &nbsp;This information will be anonymized so that you will not be personally identifiable by the information. &nbsp;We may also aggregate the anonymized information and provide it to our partners so they may use it to determine and understand how people interact with and use our Services. &nbsp;We will not disclose aggregated information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual, except as outlined below.</p>

<p>We may engage third-party companies and individuals to perform services on our behalf (e.g., without limitation, software maintenance services, advertising serving technologies, e-mail service providers, delivery services, database management, web analytics and other services). These third parties may have access to your personal information. &nbsp;If they do, this access is provided so that they may perform these tasks on our behalf and they are not authorized by us to otherwise use or disclose your personal information, except to the extent required by law.</p>

<p><strong>Change of Control</strong></p>

<p>TP-Link may elect to buy or sell assets. &nbsp;When buying or selling assets, customer information may be one of the assets that is transferred. &nbsp;Personal information may also be transferred or acquired by a third-party in the event that TP-Link is acquired, enters bankruptcy, or goes through some other change of control.</p>

<p><strong>Legal and Law Enforcement</strong></p>

<p>Please be advised that we may disclose information that you have provided us if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or legal process served on us; or (b) protect and defend the rights and property of TP-Link or others. &nbsp;In any event, we will disclose information only in accordance with applicable regulations.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>

<p>We have implemented measures, including encryption and SSL technology, designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.</p>

<p>Your account&rsquo;s privacy and security is protected by your password. In order to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information, you should select a strong password and protect it by limiting access to your computer, device, browser or application and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. &nbsp;If you use a third-party service to sign into your account, you should protect that account accordingly as well.</p>

<p>While we strive to always protect the privacy of your account and personal information in our records, we cannot always guarantee it will be completely secure. &nbsp;The security of your personal information may be compromised by unauthorized entry, unauthorized use, hardware failure, software failure, and other factors at any time.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR CHOICES</strong></p>

<p>You can control how and when you want to receive notifications from us by following instructions within the notices (e.g., clicking on &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; at the bottom of notification emails).&nbsp; You may not opt-out of administrative emails for your registered account (e.g., emails about your transactions, policy changes, forgot password and confirmation emails).</p>

<p>We use both session and persistent tracking technologies.&nbsp; Tracking technologies (e.g., cookies) can either be persistent (i.e., they remain on your computer until you delete them) or temporary (i.e., they last only until you close your browser).&nbsp; You are always free to decline tracking technologies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of the Services.&nbsp; Refer to the help section of your browser, browser extensions, or installed applications for instructions on blocking, deleting, or disabling tracking technologies such as cookies.</p>

<p>You may encounter tracking technologies/cookies from our third-party service providers, such as Google Analytics, that we have allowed to assist us with various aspects of our operations and Services.</p>

<p>On certain pages of the website you also may encounter tracking technologies from third-parties that we do not control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For more information about HTTP cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.</p>

<p><strong>ACCESSING, REVIEWING, AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</strong></p>

<p>Using the Services, you can access and may be able to edit or remove the personal information you have provided to us. &nbsp;The information you can access through the Services may change as the Services themselves change. &nbsp;When you change information or delete your account we may maintain a copy of the original information in our records for no longer than necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy and as permitted under applicable law. &nbsp;Additionally, we may use any anonymized or aggregated data that is derived from your personal information after you update or delete it; however we will not do so in a way that identifies you personally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY</strong></p>

<p>The Services are directed to a general audience and are not intended for children under the age of 13.&nbsp; We do not knowingly collect personal information via our website or online services from users in this age group.</p>

<p><strong>NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS</strong></p>

<p>Per California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents who have an established business relationship with us are entitled to ask us to identify the kinds of personal information we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and provide contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. &nbsp;If you are a California resident and would like this information, please submit a written request to:</p>

<p><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals for California Residents</strong></p>

<p>California Business &amp; Professions Code Section 22575(b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how TP-Link responds to &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; browser settings.&nbsp; TP-Link does not currently take actions to respond to Do Not Track signals because a uniform technological standard has not yet been developed.&nbsp; We may adopt a standard once one is created.</p>

<p align="left">You agree to indemnify and hold the TP-Link Group harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) arising from or in any way related to any third-party claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third-party using your account), (b) your violation of these Terms, and (c) your intentional infringement of third-party intellectual property rights.
