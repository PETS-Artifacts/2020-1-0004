<p>
Blurb, Inc, a company incorporated in Delaware (File Number 3949786) and located at 580 California Street, Suite 300, San Francisco, CA 94104, United States (“Blurb”, “us” or “we”) respects the privacy of the visitors to its Website located at http://www.blurb.com (the “Website”), and users of its Services. This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of any Personal Information and Anonymous Information you submit to us through the Website or Services. It also describes your choices regarding use, access and correction of your personal information.  The use of information collected through our service shall be limited to the purpose of providing the service for which the Client has engaged Blurb.  Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms shall have the meanings assigned to such terms set forth in the Blurb Terms and Conditions that you can find at
<a href='http://www.blurb.com/terms'>Terms and Conditions</a>
and which incorporate this Privacy Policy by reference.
</p>
<p>“Personal Information” is any information that allows us (or others) to identify an individual person and would include (for example) your name, address, email address, IP Address or phone number, as well as other non-public information that is associated with or directly linked to such information.</p>
<p>An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. We track IP Addresses solely in conjunction with session Cookies to analyze our web page flow and to determine the appropriate language settings for you based on your region if you did not previously indicate. You can find out more about the Cookies and other tracking technologies that we use and the purposes for which we use them in the section below headed 'Cookies'.</p>
<p>“Anonymous Information” means information or a combination of information that does not relate to or identify individual persons.</p>
<p>We collect and use Personal Information and Anonymous Information as described in this Privacy Policy. We respect your right to privacy and will only process Personal Information (including any sensitive personal data) you provide us in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act) and any other applicable privacy laws. For the purposes of these laws, the data controller is Blurb, Inc.</p>

<strong>Your Personal Information will be processed by Blurb, Inc., and other third party data processors for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.</strong>
</p>
<p>
<strong>By accessing or using our Website or Services or otherwise providing Personal Information to us, you consent to the processing, transfer and storage of information in and to the United States for these purposes.

</p>

Blurb complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal data from the EU, including the onward transfer liability provisions.</p>
<p>With respect to personal data received or transferred pursuant to the Privacy Shield Framework, Blurb is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.  In certain situations, Blurb may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.</p>
<p>If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=How-to-Submit-a-Complaint, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Blurb complies with the U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from Switzerland. Blurb has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

<i>What is a cookie?</i>
</b>
</h4>
<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that a web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a web site.
