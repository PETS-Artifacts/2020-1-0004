					    While every attempt is made to ensure the accuracy of all editorial content found on BoatTEST.com, the site may contain inaccuracies or outdated information. Particularly as it pertains to boat test data, visitors are advised that their on-water results will vary from those published on BoatTEST.com due to a number of factors including but not limited to environmental conditions, propeller and engine selection, boat condition, load, and more.

					    <b>Manufacturer’s Participation</b><br>
					    Each individual builder sponsors the boat tests. Builders pay BoatTEST Publishing a fee to cover production and distribution costs only. The boat tests themselves are conducted independently by our staff of U.S.C.G.-licensed Captains and the opinions expressed in the editorial are those of the captains and have been edited and approved by BoatTEST.com. Test numbers shown are recorded by BoatTEST.com’s technical team and are NOT supplied by the manufacturers. Test results are affected by load, powertrain, running surface condition, sea state, and ambient air temperature and humidity. While our test results are certified accurate given our test conditions on test day, your results may vary.
