This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations or otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers, and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our" and "Hotels.com" refer to Hotels.com, L.P., a Texas limited partnership and/or our subsidiaries. The term "you" refers to the customer visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.<br /> <br />This Website is offered to you conditioned upon your acceptance without modification of all the terms, conditions, and notices set forth below (collectively, the "Terms of Use” or "Agreement"). Please read these Terms of Use carefully, as they contain important information about limitations of liability and resolution of disputes through arbitration rather than in court. You should also read our Privacy Policy, which also governs your use of the Website, and is incorporated by reference in this Agreement.  By accessing or using this Website, booking any reservations for travel products or services on this Website, or contacting our call center agents, you agree that the Terms of Use then in force shall apply. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use or book any reservations through this Website or our call center agents.<br /> <br />USE OF THE WEBSITE<br /> <br />As a condition of your use of this Website, you warrant that<br /> <br />1.  you are at least 18 years of age,<br />2.  you possess the legal authority to create a binding legal obligation,<br />3.  you will use this Website in accordance with this Agreement,<br />4.  you will only use this Website to make legitimate reservations for you or for another person for whom you are legally authorized to act,<br />5.  all information supplied by you on this Website is true, accurate, current and complete, and<br />6.  if you have an Hotels.com account, you will safeguard your account information and will supervise and be completely responsible for any use of your account by anyone other than you. We retain the right at our sole discretion to deny access to anyone to this Website and the services we offer, at any time and for any reason, including, but not limited to, for violation of this Agreement.<br /> <br /> <br />DISPUTES<br />Hotels.com is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns.  But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.<br />You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Website, any dealings with our customer service agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (“Claims”) by contacting Hotels.com Customer Support at http://service.hotels.com/app/home/locale/en_US or on (877) 903-0071<br />If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.<br />Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify.  This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, travel suppliers or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement).  This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted this Agreement regardless of whether prior versions of the Agreement required arbitration.<br />There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.  However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys’ fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Agreement as a court would.<br />Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator’s fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location. <br /><br />To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to “Expedia Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,” at Expedia, Inc., 333 108th Ave N.E. Bellevue, WA 98004. If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided.  The AAA's rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.<br />Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.  If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.  The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.  An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.<br /> <br />PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES<br /> <br />The content and information on this Website (including, but not limited to, price and availability of travel services), as well as the infrastructure used to provide such content and information, is proprietary to us or our suppliers and providers.

The room rate displayed on the Website is a combination of the pre- negotiated room rate for rooms reserved on your behalf by Hotels.com and the facilitation fee retained by Hotels.com to compensate us for our services. You authorize Hotels.com to book reservations for the total reservation price, which includes the room rate displayed on the Website, plus tax recovery charges, service fees, and where applicable, taxes on Hotels.com’s services. You agree that your credit card will be charged by Hotels.com for the total reservation price. Upon submitting your reservation request you authorize Hotels.com to facilitate hotel reservations on your behalf, including making payment arrangements with hotel suppliers.<br /> <br />You acknowledge that, except as provided below with respect to tax obligations on the amounts we retain for our services, Hotels.com does not collect taxes for remittance to applicable taxing authorities. The tax recovery charges on prepaid hotel transactions are a recovery of the estimated taxes (e.g. sales and use, occupancy, room tax, excise tax, value added tax, etc.) that Hotels.com pays to the hotel supplier for taxes due on the hotel's rental rate for the room. The hotel suppliers invoice Hotels.com for tax amounts. The hotel suppliers are responsible for remitting applicable taxes to the applicable taxing jurisdictions. Hotels.com does not act as co-vendors with the supplier with whom we book or reserve our customer's travel arrangements. Taxability and the appropriate tax rate vary greatly by location. The actual tax amounts paid by Hotels.com to the hotel suppliers may vary from the tax recovery charge amounts, depending upon the rates, taxability, etc. in effect at the time of the actual use of the hotel by our customers. We retain our fees as compensation in servicing your travel reservation. Our fees vary based on the amount and type of hotel reservation.<br /> <br />Sales, use and/or local hotel occupancy taxes are imposed on the amounts that we charge for our services (service fee and/or facilitation fee) in certain jurisdictions. The actual tax amounts on our services may vary depending on the rates in effect at the time of your hotel stay. <br /> <br />PAY NOW ONLINE OR PAY LATER AT HOTEL DETAILS<br /> <br />With certain hotels, you may be presented with the option to pay online immediately or to pay later at the hotel itself. If you select the option to pay online immediately, you will be charged the amount in the currency that you select immediately. If you select to pay later at the hotel itself, the hotel will charge you in the local currency of the relevant hotel at the time of your stay. Tax rates and foreign exchange rates could change in the time between booking and stay. You shall provide the details of your payment card and the supplier or Hotels.com will often have to verify: (i) the validity of the payment card (through a charge of a nominal value that is either refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the supplier) and, (ii) the availability of funds on the payment card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card). Hotels.com reserves the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion (please see Supplier Rules and Restrictions).<br /> <br />Many bank and credit card companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand (e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) are in different countries. The currency exchange rate, if applicable, and any transaction fee are determined solely by the bank or other agency processing the transaction. These fees may be applied by the card issuer as a charge to the cardholders account. When applied by the card issuer, the fees will be listed separately from the transaction amount on a credit or debit card statement. This means the amount listed on your credit or debit card statement may be a different figure than the figure shown on the billing summary page for a reservation booked on this Website. If you have any questions about these fees or any exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.<br /> <br />PRICES<br />The price of the travel services will be as quoted on the website from time to time, except in cases of obvious error. Prices are liable to change at any time, but changes will not affect bookings already accepted.  Despite Hotels.com’s best efforts, some of the travel services listed on the website may be incorrectly priced.

You can redeem your Free Night online, or give us a call and we will make your booking for you.<br />The maximum value of your Free Night is based on the value of the 10 nights you collected as long as they have not expired. This value is equal to the average daily rate, excluding taxes and fees, of the nights you previously stayed. If you collected a night at a Hotels.com Secret Price (defined below), this price rather than the regular price will be used for the purposes of the calculation. You must pay for taxes, fees, meals and any other costs associated with your Free Night.<br />If you used different currencies when collecting your 10 nights, the value of each night is currently calculated using the currency associated with the territory you were in when you joined the Program.<br />Free Night stays are subject to all applicable booking terms and conditions. You will not collect a night when you redeem your Free Night. Collected nights have no cash value, and you cannot redeem your Free Night for cash.<br />If you redeem your Free Night on a stay that is less than the maximum value of your Free Night, you will not get the difference in cash, credit or anything else. You can redeem your Free Night on a stay that costs more than the maximum value of your Free Night – you just pay the difference.<br />If you have more than 1 Free Night to redeem, you can choose which booking you want to apply it to. You cannot combine your Free Night with any other offer, discount coupon, voucher or code, unless the terms for each of these say you can. This means that when you book a stay and redeem your Free Night, you generally will not be able to get an additional discount on that booking.<br />If you redeem your Free Night on a booking that is longer than 1 night, we will automatically apply its value to the most expensive night in that booking, subject to its maximum value.<br />Free Night stays are subject to all applicable cancellation policies that are passed onto us by the Hotels.com Rewards property. If you cancel a Free Night within the property’s cancellation window, we will return it to your account within 72 hours of your cancellation. If you cancel a Free Night outside of the property’s cancellation window, it will not be returned to your account.<br />If you want to change the dates of a booking that includes the Free Night you redeemed, you will need to cancel the booking, wait for the Free Night to be returned to your account, then rebook so you can apply your Free Night to your new booking.<br />Hotels.com Rewards tiers<br />The Program has 3 tiers: Hotels.com Rewards, Hotels.com Rewards Silver and Hotels.com Rewards Gold. You will join as a Hotels.com Rewards member. When you collect 10-29 nights in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Silver. When you collect 30 nights or more in a membership year, you will qualify for Hotels.com Rewards Gold. A membership year runs for a year from the date you first created an account, and each anniversary after that.<br />Silver and Gold members have a dedicated phone number they can call 24/7 to make or discuss their bookings. And there are other benefits like early sale access and exclusive offers. These will all be available within 2 weeks of qualifying for Silver or Gold, and will last for the rest of that membership year and the whole of the following membership year. If you do not collect enough nights to stay in Silver or Gold, we will move you down a tier for the next membership year.<br />Changes and Termination<br />Your nights will not expire as long as you keep your account active at least once every 12 months. This means you must collect a night or redeem a Free Night in that time, and when you do, the expiry date will be extended for another 12 months. If you do not collect nights or redeem Free Nights in a 12 month period, your nights will expire and we may deactivate your account. If this happens, your nights will not be reissued. Sign into your account to check when your nights are due to expire.<br />We may change our terms and conditions at any time, with or without notice, including the rules for collecting nights, the different membership tiers and their qualification requirements and associated benefits, the rules for redeeming your Free Night, the list of eligible Hotels.com Rewards properties, and the maximum value of a Free Night. We may communicate these changes to you by email or on our Hotels.com website so please make sure you check your account regularly.<br />Hotels.com Rewards has no end date and will continue until we close it, which could happen at any time. If we do close the Program, you will have 30 days from when we announce its closure to redeem any Free Nights you have in your account. After that date, you will lose your Free Nights and you will not be compensated.<br />By continuing to collect nights and redeem Free Nights with Hotels.com Rewards, you accept any changes to these terms and conditions. You are responsible for keeping up to date on any changes that we may make. The most current version will always be available on our website.<br />General Hotels.com Rewards Terms &amp; Conditions<br />We reserve the right to discontinue your membership if you act fraudulently or use our loyalty program in a way that does not comply with our terms and conditions, or any federal or state laws, regulations, statutes or ordinances. If we discontinue your membership, you may lose your collected nights and benefits. We also have the right to take appropriate administrative and/or legal action, including criminal prosecution if necessary.<br />While you are signed up to Hotels.com Rewards, we may communicate any updates to your account or transactions to you by email. We may take back your nights at any time. You cannot sell or transfer your nights, or combine them with another member’s nights. Nights are not transferable if a member dies, if there is a domestic relations issue, or otherwise by operation of law. <br />The Program is void where prohibited by law. Our failure to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that or any other provision. Our decision on all questions or disputes regarding the Program is final.<br /> <br />SECRET PRICES<br />Hotels.com Secret Prices ("Secret Prices") are available to the following customers:<br />• Hotels.com Rewards members;<br />• users who unlock Secret Prices on the website by subscribing to receive emails from Hotels.com; and<br />• users of the Mobile Application (as defined in these terms and conditions below).<br />Hotels.com Rewards members – If you are signed in to your Hotels.com account when browsing the website, you will automatically be shown Secret Prices on selected hotels where the "Your Secret Price" banner is displayed.<br /> <br />Email subscribers – If you are browsing the website and you are not signed in as a Hotels.com Rewards member, you can still unlock Secret Prices by subscribing to receive emails from Hotels.com.

Neither price match claims made on the day of check-in nor package reservations are eligible for this guarantee, and other terms and conditions apply, as per the below.<br />Submitting a Claim - You must contact the customer call center or submit your request using the online Best Price Guarantee form by 11:59 PM (PST) seven days after the date you made your booking. (For example, if you made your booking on the first day of a month, you must contact us by the eighth day of that month.) The lower rate must be available for booking at the time you contact us, as determined by our customer service representatives.<br />Comparison Must Be to Same Itinerary - The Best Price Guarantee is available only for exact itinerary matches, including property, room type, applicable cancellation policy, and dates of travel as booked through hotels.com. In addition, the comparison must be to the same property purchased stand-alone through another website – in other words, properties booked on another website as part of a package are not eligible for the guarantee. The guarantee applies to the cost of booked travel, as presented on your booking confirmation, including any taxes and fees collected by us from you at the time of booking. The guarantee does not apply to any taxes or fees collected by any third party from you, such as those taxes and fees a hotel may collect directly from you when you stay at the hotel. It is not available for reservations on websites where the property or other reservation details are unknown until after purchase. Nor is it available for price match claims made on the day of check-in. You must meet all requirements imposed on the lower price (if any), including, without limitation, residency, regional and age-related requirements.<br />Comparison must be available to the general public - The Best Price Guarantee applies only to prices both advertised and available to the general public. It also applies to our Secret Prices. The Best Price Guarantee does not apply to rates offered on competitors' membership program websites; corporate discounts or rates; group, charter, rewards program, incentive, meeting, convention, consolidator or interline prices; prices obtained via auction or similar process; or prices available only by using a coupon or other promotion not offered to the general public. The lower rate may not come from a website where you call to get the rate, or from an e-mail that you received. <br />Claim Verification - All requests are subject to verification by hotels.com. We will not accept screenshots or other purported evidence of a lower price that we cannot independently confirm. Nor will we verify any request that we believe, in our sole discretion, is the result of a printing or other error or is made fraudulently or in bad faith.<br />Refunds for Verified Requests - Verified requests will receive a credit to the credit card used for the reservation. Where you have paid for your hotel at the time of booking, we will send your refund upon verification of your request.  Where you have chosen to pay later at the hotel, you will pay the hotel the original price upon arrival and we will send your refund after you have completed your stay.  Note, it may take up to 30 days or the next billing cycle for your refund to appear on your statement.<br />Changes - We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify or discontinue the Best Price  Guarantee or to restrict its availability to any person, at any time, for any or no reason, and without prior notice or liability to you. The terms that are in effect at the time of your bookingwill determine your eligibility under the guarantee. Our failure to enforce any provision of these Terms &amp; Conditions shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.<br /> <br />TRAVEL DESTINATIONS<br /> <br />Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others.
