As such, UPI takes reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity and privacy of this information. 
<p>To enhance the user experience, UPI may ask you for information such as your name, e-mail address, year of birth, gender, zip code, country, street address, and other information that identifies a particular individual. You agree and understand that UPI may use such information in many ways, including for the following purposes
<ul style="list-style: decimal;">
	<li>to provide you with any requested information, content, goods, and/or services, whether offered by UPI or any advertisers, sponsors, licensees, or any other third parties
	<li>to send you information and promotional materials about content, goods and services, whether offered by UPI or by any advertisers, sponsors, licensees or any other third parties

	<li>to share with and/or sell to any successor to or purchaser of part or all of the assets of UPI.

<p>In the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, UPI reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.

The type of information collected includes user geographic location, which pages each user visits, ISP, GMT timeframe, referral and destination sources, as well as visit duration.  This information may be disclosed to advertisers and other businesses in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including "hits" on UPI.com) and demographics, but only in forms that do not reveal a user's identity. <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">UPI's online partners, who serve ads when you visit our Web site and provide other online services, may also use beacons, cookies &amp; other tracking technologies to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you and to track how ads are displayed and which ads are clicked on.
