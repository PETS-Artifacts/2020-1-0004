<h2>Cookies</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
'Cookies' are tiny files put on your hard disk for various reasons.

	<li>there are some features on our Sites which are only available with the use of cookies;<br><br>
	<li>cookies are used to assist us in identifying you and to help keep you logged-in which allows you to input your password less often during a session;<br><br>

<h2>Protecting Your Account</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
The password you choose is indispensable to access your account. Use a combination of unique identifiers (letters, numbers, and characters), and do not give away your CPAPtalk.com password to anyone. If for some reason you decide to give away your password or your personal information to others, be aware that you are accountable and liable for any and all activity executed under your account. If your password is compromised, you may lose considerable authority over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Accordingly, if for any reason you have revealed or lost control of your password, then you should notify CPAPtalk.com and change your password without delay.</p><br>

<h2>Viewing and Making Changes to Your Personal Information</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
You may view and change much of your personal information by logging into your account at CPAPtalk.com. You are required to revise your personal information quickly when a change occurs or if it is erroneous. Upon your request, and as soon as it is reasonably practicable, your account will be terminated and your personal information archived, based on your account activity and if allowed under subsequently relevant laws. We do keep a record of personal information from terminated accounts to abide by legal requirements, avert fraudulent activity, collect monies due to us, resolve disputes, regulate issues, cooperate with any investigations, enforce our CPAPtalk.com User Agreement, and likewise take other actions legally allowed.</p><br>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
Protecting and securing your information is of the highest priority to us. We consider the data we collect and your personal information to be an extremely valuable asset that should be protected. Your information is stored and processed on dedicated servers located in the United States that are protected by physical and technological security measures. We use many methods in good faith to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access. However, as you may be aware, third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions of your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet, and there is the possibility that users may mistreat or mishandle your personal information that they find or gather during your interactions on the CPAPtalk.com website. Consequently, while we go to great lengths to safeguard your privacy, we in no way guarantee, and you should not have the expectation, that your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet will always remain private. Here is more about the security of your personal information.</p>

<ul style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
	<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts personal information you send to CPAPtalk.com.<br><Br>
	<li>Email messages are not typically secure so we do not recommend sending us any critical financial information such as credit cards numbers, bank account numbers, or similar information via email. If you choose to provide this type of information via email, you do so at your own risk.<br><Br>
	<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off of your CPAPtalk.com account when finished using a shared computer.<br>
</ul><br>

<h2>Personal Health Information</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
We are legally required to protect the privacy of your 'Personal Health Information', or 'PHI' for short. Additionally incorporated into this Privacy Policy is more information described in the <a href='phi-privacy.php'>PHI Privacy Policy</a>.</p><Br>

<h2>General</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the changes on CPAPtalk.com. In the event that we make any significant material change to this Privacy Policy, we may attempt to notify you by email, but are not required to do so. If your questions are not answered online, you may write to us at: CPAPtalk.com Attn: Legal - Privacy Policy, 13235 N.
