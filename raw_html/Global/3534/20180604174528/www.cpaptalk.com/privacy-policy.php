<h2>Protecting Your Account</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
The password you choose is indispensable to access your account. Use a combination of unique identifiers (letters, numbers, and characters), and do not give away your CPAPtalk.com password to anyone. If for some reason you decide to give away your password or your personal information to others, be aware that you are accountable and liable for any and all activity executed under your account. If your password is compromised, you may lose considerable authority over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Accordingly, if for any reason you have revealed or lost control of your password, then you should notify CPAPtalk.com and change your password without delay.</p><br>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
Protecting and securing your information is of the highest priority to us. We consider the data we collect and your personal information to be an extremely valuable asset that should be protected. Your information is stored and processed on dedicated servers located in the United States that are protected by physical and technological security measures. We use many methods in good faith to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access. However, as you may be aware, third parties may illegally intercept or access transmissions of your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet, and there is the possibility that users may mistreat or mishandle your personal information that they find or gather during your interactions on the CPAPtalk.com website. Consequently, while we go to great lengths to safeguard your privacy, we in no way guarantee, and you should not have the expectation, that your personal data or exchanges of information over the Internet will always remain private. Here is more about the security of your personal information.</p>

<ul style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
	<li>We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts personal information you send to CPAPtalk.com.<br><Br>
	<li>Email messages are not typically secure so we do not recommend sending us any critical financial information such as credit cards numbers, bank account numbers, or similar information via email. If you choose to provide this type of information via email, you do so at your own risk.<br><Br>
	<li>It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off of your CPAPtalk.com account when finished using a shared computer.<br>
</ul><br>

<h2>Personal Health Information</h2>
<p style='text-align:justify;font-size: 13px;'>
