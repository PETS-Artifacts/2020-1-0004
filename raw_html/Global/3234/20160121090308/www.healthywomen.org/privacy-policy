<p>To help users understand the Personal Information and Personal Health Information we gather and the practices we employ, HealthyWomen has developed this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Disclosure of Information</strong></p>
<p>Except as described in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, HealthyWomen will not disclose any Personal Information or Personal Health Information it gathers from you on the Website.  We may only release Personal Information or Personal Health Information to third-parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property or defend or assert legal rights.  In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information or Personal Health Information to a third-party, we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order.  In addition, we may disclose Personal Information as described below. </p>
<p><strong>How is Personal Information Requested and/or Collected and Used at HealthyWomen?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.	User (Consumer) Surveys</strong> - Our user surveys include registering Personal Information, such as name, email address, address, age, last education level attained, profession, ethnicity, primary language, household income, relationship status. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the visitor therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information.</p>
<p>The information gathered from user surveys is used for internal analysis purposes, so that we learn about the profile of our user audience. HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise provide to third parties any individually attributable information. HealthyWomen however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate data and information with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information.</p>
<p><strong>2.	Aggregate Data</strong> &ndash; HealthyWomen may combine, in a non-identifiable format, the Personal Information and Personal Health Information you provide with information from other users to create a compilation of statistical data (&quot;Aggregate Data&quot;) that may be disclosed to third-parties. Aggregate Data does not contain any information that could be used to contact or identify you.  For example, HealthyWomen may use information gathered to create a composite profile of all the users of a particular third-party site.  These third-party websites may use this information to understand community needs and to design appropriate programs and activities on their site.  HealthyWomen will not disclose your Personal Information and Personal Health Information to any third-party without your prior permission, except as otherwise permitted by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>3.	Women's Health Surveys</strong> - Topic-specific surveys at the site may or may not request a participant to register/provide Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the visitor therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose Personal Information.</p>

HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, trade, lease, or otherwise provide to third-parties any Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information. HealthyWomen, however, reserves the right to review and disclose aggregate survey data with third-parties to better serve our users, but will only do so in a fashion that protects from disclosure every user's Personal Information and Personal Health Information.</p>

As with any public forum on any website, the information that you post can show up on any third-party search engine.  You should think carefully before disclosing any Personal Information and/or Personal health Information in a Community Site.</p>
<p>These forums are to be respected and to be used professionally. HealthyWomen will take steps to remove individuals and/or their posts from the forums that do not abide by the Community Site's discussions protocol, such as those who include abusive language or demonstrate pornographic behavior.</p>
<p>HealthyWomen will use information, including Personal Information, gathered from the Community Sites in the event that the participants violate the terms and conditions of these discussions and we need to contact users. In addition, HealthyWomen uses the information collected from the Community Sites to evaluate consumer thoughts and behaviors in aggregate form.</p>

<p><strong>How Does HealthyWomen Disclose Information?</strong></p>
<p>HealthyWomen does not sell, rent, loan, lease or otherwise provide any Personal Information collected at our site to any third-parties.</p>
<p><strong>How Does HealthyWomen use Cookies?</strong></p>
<p>When you logon to the Website, a cookie is generated on the server, or the machine that hosts the site. The cookie is a randomly generated number that does not include any of your Personal Information. This randomly generated number or cookie remains on the server machine, not on your computer, until you leave the site. When you visit the Website again, a different, unique randomly generated number or cookie is assigned.</p>
<p>HealthyWomen uses cookies for user convenience. This enables the user to use the site without needing to input the same Personal Information over and over again. Cookies also enable HealthyWomen on an aggregate basis to track site navigation, such as what sections users are visiting, and how long they stay there. </p>
<p>HealthyWomen does not and will not use cookies to direct advertisers to you based on your Personal Information. Additionally, HealthyWomen does not and will not allow third-parties to include cookies in their banners/promotional logos.</p>
<p>Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies.  Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject Cookies in the &quot;Help&quot; section of the toolbar.  If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Website may not work properly but you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use the Website.  We do not link Non-Personal Information from Cookies to Personal Information without your permission and do not use Cookies to collect or store Personal Health Information about you.</p>
<p><strong>Web Beacons</strong> &ndash; We also may use Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Website and your use of special promotions or newsletters.  The information collected by Web Beacons (i) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using the Website, (ii) how many people open our e-mails, and (iii) for what purposes these actions are being taken.  We do not link Non-Personal Information from Web Beacons to Personal Information without your permission and do not use Web Beacons to collect or store Personal Health Information about you.</p>
<p><strong>How Does HealthyWomen Secure Your Information?</strong></p>
<p>HealthyWomen places your Personal Information as its highest priority. Therefore, when you provide Personal Information on the Website, we use a unique security system that combines leading technical safeguards, encryption and a code of conduct for employees who access any information. HealthyWomen uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting your Personal Information to our servers to ensure the integrity and privacy of your Personal Information. Also, all transactions are conducted through secure servers, which are protected behind state-of-the-art firewalls, and only selected HealthyWomen personnel and contractors have access, via password, to them.</p>
<p>You should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting any information, personal or otherwise, over the Internet.

HealthyWomen will make every reasonable effort to protect your Personal Information from loss, misuse or alteration.</p>
<p><strong>How Does HealthyWomen Cooperate with Law Enforcement Officials?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>HealthyWomen cooperates with all law enforcement inquiries and with third-parties to enforce their intellectual property or other rights. Therefore, those third-parties, local, state and federal law enforcement officials can obtain your Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information as a result of a legal requirement. By way of example, HealthyWomen may be required to disclose information to the government or others under certain circumstances (e.g., matters of national security, law enforcement or other issues of public importance), or third-parties may unlawfully intercept Personal Information and/or Personal Health Information. Furthermore, we may release Personal Information and/or Personal health Information in order to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order.</p>
