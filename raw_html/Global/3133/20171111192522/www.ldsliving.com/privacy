For more information as to how we collect Personal Information, please see the section 4 below entitled: "How do we use your Personal Information?"</p>

<h2 id="n3">3.  How do we collect your Personal Information?</h2>

<p>(a). Information that you provide to DBC</p>

<ul>
  <li>We collect information you provide to DBC when you request products, services or information from DBC, register with DBC, participate in Public Forums or other activities on our sites and Applications, respond to customer surveys, or otherwise interact with DBC. As a general matter, you can browse in our stores and on our websites without submitting your Personal Information to DBC. However, there are a number of circumstances in which you may need to provide DBC with your Personal Information. The most common of these circumstances may include:</li>
  <li>Making a purchase or placing an order: When you make a purchase or place an order in our stores or place an order online without an account, you may need to submit Personal Information to DBC.</li>
  <li>Creating an online account: You can create a password-protected Deseretbook.com account to complete your online order, to purchase or download eBooks, other digital content ("Digital Content"), DBC's apps, interact on our websites or blogs, or to save items to an online wish list. To create any of these accounts we will ask you to provide DBC with Personal Information. If you use your online account to make a purchase or download, we will use the Personal Information stored in your account and/or require you to input additional Personal Information, such as credit card information or address, to complete your order or download.</li>
  <li>Enrolling in our Member loyalty program (Platinum): When you enroll in our Member loyalty program (Platinum), we will ask you to submit Personal Information as part of your Member profile.

We use this information to monitor the usage of our websites as necessary for our business. This information does not include Personal Information.</li>
  <li>Information collected using cookies: Like many online retailers, we use cookies to personalize and enhance your browsing and shopping experience. Cookies are small files that we place on your computer's hard drive to collect information about your activities on our websites.

Browsers are typically set to create cookies automatically. You can choose to have your browser notify you when cookies are being written to your computer or accessed, or you can disable cookies entirely.

  <li>Information collected from DBC applications: When you use a DBC application, we automatically collect information that the app sends to DBC when it is connected to the Internet.
