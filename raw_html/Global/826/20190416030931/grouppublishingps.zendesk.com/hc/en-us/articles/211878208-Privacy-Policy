<p><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>Last Updated March 8, 2019</p>
<p> At Group Publishing our goal is to be the first source that you turn to for tips and resources to help you maximize the effectiveness of your ministry. Group Publishing respects your privacy and holds it as a priority. Our privacy policy is intended to keep you informed about the information we collect about you, when and with whom we share your information, and to give you a choice in how we use and disclose your information.</p>
<p>This “Privacy Policy” describes the privacy practices of Group Publishing, Inc. and our subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Group”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose and otherwise process personal information in connection with our websites, mobile apps, and other services, and explains the rights and choices available to individuals with respect to their information. For convenience, our websites are referred to as the “Sites.” The Sites, together with our mobile apps and other services, are collectively referred to as the “Services.” This Privacy Policy applies to any of the Services on which the Privacy Policy is posted or linked.</p>
<p>Individuals located in the European Economic Area should be sure to read the important information provided here.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Information We Collect</strong></p>
<p>We collect personal information about you in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong>Information you give us:</strong></p>
<p>Personal information that you may provide through the Services or otherwise communicate with us includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personal and business contact information, such as your first name, last name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and company name;</li>
<li>Registration information, such as your username and password;</li>
<li>Feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide in your responses to surveys and when you participate in market research activities, report a problem with the Sites, receive customer support or otherwise correspond with us;</li>
<li>Usage information, such as information about how you use the Sites and interact with us;</li>
<li>Marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications and details about how you engage with them; and</li>
<li>Resume or CV information, such as work experience, educational history, salary, and languages spoken.</li>
<li>We may combine other publicly available information, such as information related to the organization for which you work, with the personal information that you provide to us through the Services.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Information automatically collected:</strong></p>
<p>We may automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device when you access our Sites. For example, we may log your computer or mobile device operating system name and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, browser language, screen resolution, information relating to how the Services function, your general geographic location derived through your IP address (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and the physical location of a device at the time of a crash, the website you visited before browsing to our Sites, pages you viewed, how long you spent on a page, access times and information about your use of and actions on our Sites. We collect this information about you using cookies. Please refer to the Cookies and Similar Technologies section for more details.</p>
<p>Information from Social Networking Sites. Our Site includes interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each a “SNS”). If you connect to a SNS through our Site you authorize us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Notice. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies</strong></p>
<p><strong>What are cookies?</strong></p>
<p>We may collect information using “cookies.” Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site.</p>
<p>We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which we use to recognize your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognize your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.</p>
<p><strong>Cookies we use:</strong></p>
<p>Our Site uses the following types of cookies for the purposes set out below:</p>
<p>Essential Cookies -  These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Site and to enable you to use some of its features. Without these cookies, the services that you have asked for cannot be provided, and we only use these cookies to provide you with those services. </p>
<p>Functionality Cookies -  These cookies allow our Site to remember choices you make when you use our Site. The purpose of these cookies is to provide you with a more personal experience and to avoid you having to re-select your preferences every time you visit our Site. </p>
<p>Analytics and Performance -  Cookies These cookies are used to collect information about traffic to our Site and how users use our Site. The information gathered may include the number of visitors to our Site, the websites that referred them to our Site, the pages they visited on our Site, what time of day they visited our Site, whether they have visited our Site before, and other similar information. We use this information to help operate our Site more efficiently, to gather broad demographic information and to monitor the level of activity on our Site. We use Google Analytics for this purpose. Google Analytics uses its own cookies. It is only used to improve how our Site works. You can find out more information about Google Analytics cookies here and about how Google protects your data here. You can prevent the use of Google Analytics relating to your use of our Site by downloading and installing the browser plugin available here. </p>
<p>Targeted and advertising cookies - These cookies track your browsing habits to enable us to show advertising which is more likely to be of interest to you. These cookies use information about your browsing history to group you with other users who have similar interests. Based on that information, and with our permission, third party advertisers can place cookies to enable them to show advertisements which we think will be relevant to your interests while you are on third party websites.</p>
<p>You can disable certain cookies which remember your browsing habits and target advertising at you by visiting:</p>
<ul>
<li>-Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) Consumer Opt-Out Page</li>
<li>-Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) WebChoices</li>
<li>-Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) Consumer Choice (for Canadian users)</li>
<li>-European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Choice (for EU users) </li>
</ul>
<p>If you choose to remove targeted or advertising cookies, you will still see advertisements but they may not be relevant to you. Even if you do choose to remove cookies by the companies listed at the above link, not all companies that serve online behavioral advertising are included in this list, and so you may still receive some cookies and tailored adverts from companies that are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Disabling cookies</strong></p>
<p>You can typically remove or reject cookies via your browser settings. In order to do this, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “settings,” “help” “tools” or “edit” facility). Many browsers are set to accept cookies until you change your settings.</p>
<p>Further information about cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your computer or mobile device and how to manage and delete them, visit www.allaboutcookies.org.</p>
<p>If you do not accept our cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of our Site. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer or mobile device and you may need to log in every time you visit our Site.</p>
<p><strong>Google User-ID:</strong></p>
<p>Group Publishing Web sites use Google Analytics and User-ID to track user behavior in order to provide a more personalized experience for our visitors. No personally identifiable information is shared with Google.</p>
<p><strong>Pixel tags:</strong></p>
<p>We may also use pixel tags (which are also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) on our Site to track the actions of users on our Site. Unlike cookies, which are stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website, pixel tags are embedded invisibly on webpages. Pixel tags measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about usage of the Site, so that we can manage our content more effectively. The information we collect using pixel tags is not linked to our users’ personal data.</p>
<p><strong>Do Not Track Signals: </strong></p>
<p>Some Internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to “do not track” signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com">http://www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To create anonymous data for analytics:</strong></p>
<p>We may create anonymous data from your personal information and other individuals whose personal information we collect. We make personal information into anonymous data by excluding information that makes the data personally identifiable to you, and use that anonymous data for our lawful business purposes.</p>
<p><strong>For compliance, fraud prevention and safety:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>We may disclose your personal information to our subsidiaries and corporate affiliates for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li>Service Providers. We may employ third party companies and individuals to administer and provide the Services on our behalf (such as customer support, hosting, email delivery and database management services). These third parties may use your information only as directed by Group and in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy, and are prohibited from using or disclosing your information for any other purpose.</li>

</ul>

<p>You may opt out of marketing-related emails by clicking on a link at the bottom of each such email, or by contacting us at <strong><a href="mailto:info@Group.com">info@Group.com</a></strong>. You may continue to receive service-related and other non-marketing emails.</p>
<p><strong>Testimonials</strong></p>
<p>If you gave us consent to post a testimonial on our Sites, but wish to update or delete it, please contact us.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing not to share your personal information</strong></p>
<p>Where we are required by law to collect your personal information, or where we need your personal information in order to provide the Services to you, if you do not provide this information when requested (or you later ask to delete it), we may not be able to provide you with the Services. We will tell you what information you must provide to receive the Services by designating it as required in the Services or through other appropriate means.</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>The security of your personal information is very important to us. We take a number of organizational, technical and physical measures designed to protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no security safeguards are 100% secure and we cannot guarantee the security of your information. </p>
<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>
<p>Group is headquartered in the United States and has affiliates and service providers in other countries, and your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other locations outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>Other Sites and Services</strong></p>
<p>The Sites may contain links to other websites and services. These links are not an endorsement, authorization or representation that we are affiliated with that third party. We do not exercise control over third party websites or services, and are not responsible for their actions. Other websites and services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the other websites you visit and services you use.</p>
<p><strong>User Generated Content</strong></p>
<p>We may make available on our Sites, or link to, features that allow you to share information online (e.g., on message boards, in chat areas, in file uploads, through events, etc.). Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. We have no control over, and take no responsibility for, the use, storage or dissemination of such publicly-disclosed personal information. By posting personal information online in public forums, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.</p>
<p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, you will be notified via e-mail (where we have your contact information) or another manner through the Services that we believe reasonably likely to reach you (which may include posting a new privacy policy or a specific announcement on our Sites).</p>
<p>Any modifications to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon our posting of the new terms and/or upon implementation of the new changes on the Service (or as otherwise indicated at the time of posting). In all cases, your continued use of the Services after the posting of any modified Privacy Policy indicates your acceptance of the terms of the modified Privacy Policy.</p>
