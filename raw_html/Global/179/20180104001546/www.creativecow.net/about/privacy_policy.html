Many magazines in our industry have a &quot;list sales manager&quot; whose responsibility is to sell their membership lists. We do not have one, as we do not sell our list. We do have an opt-in list (it is not mandatory that you be a part of that list) from which we do send sponsored 3rd party advertising messages that relate to the tools, systems and related products that are a part of our industry, but they come from us and your information was never given to our advertisers. We take our commitment to our members very seriously and we strive to maintain your trust. Creative COW would not be the incredible success that it is, were  we to violate that trust. This said, here's what our lawyers would have us say about your privacy while visiting and participating in Creative COW...</font></em></p>

			        </strong>To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available at the bottom of our homepage and nearly every page within Creative COW and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested of you. Creative COW does not provide any outside party your information in any way wherein your individual information is given. Only aggregate data which does not expose a member's personal information -- such as how many pages on average, the type of tools used, the average time spent in our network, etc. -- is ever given to outside parties. Your privacy is paramount with us.</font></font></p>

			        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Way We Use Information:<br>
			        </strong>For our peer-to-peer forums support members: the information that you give us is used to make your experience of using our system more rewarding and interactive, as we do track the things you visit and the search terms you use, etc. The items we track are never given or sold to anyone outside of Creative COW in any way in which individual user information can be and the information is only used to allow our system to better serve you during your visits.<br>
			              <br>
			              For customers who purchase a product from us: 
			          We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.
			          
			          We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.<br>
			          <br>
		            We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.<br>
		            <br>
		            You can register with our website if you would like to receive information, such as our own newsletters and the 3rd party newsletters we send on behalf of our sponsors to the people that opt-in to this list. You can also register for updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you specify that you would like to receive information when you complete the registration form.</font></font></p>
			        <p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>What We Do and Do Not Share With Our Advertisers and Partners:<br>
			        </strong>We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.
			          
			          Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.<br>
			          <br>
			          <strong>Our Commitment To Data Security:</strong><br>
		            To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We do not maintain any credit card information online when you place an order with us. We use a major bank, the Royal Bank of Scotland's  RBS World Pay credit card processing service, so our members and customers can be assured that their information is handled with the utmost care and data integrity available online today.<br>
		            <br>
		            <strong>Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:</strong><br>
		            We are a &quot;family friendly&quot; site and work hard to moderate and remove things that might be posted that would be offensive or inappropriate for children. Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us and for that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know to be under 13, and no part of our website is purposely structured to attract anyone under 13. That said, we do serve many schools around the world and we do know of some elementary schools that use our site as part of their curriculum in training their students in media production techniques, etc. We take this trust very seriously and therefore strive to maintain a site that serves even its youngest members with respect, integrity and privacy.<br>
		            <br>
		            <strong>How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information:</strong><br>
		            You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain byvisiting yopur user profile log-in, found in the upper-right of our interface. Should you have forgotten your password, our mechanism will send you your password if you request it, when you attempt to log-in to your user profile.
