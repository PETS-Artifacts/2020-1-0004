<h1>2. What Personal Information we collect about you and how we collect it</h1>

<p>We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our Services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and Services, to analyze how users utilize the Services, and as otherwise outlined in this Privacy Notice. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties, as described in section 4.</p>

<p>It is important that the Personal Information we hold about you is accurate and current. Please keep us informed if your Personal Information changes during your relationship with us.</p>

<h2>2.a. Information You Provide to Us</h2>

<p><strong>Account information:</strong> We collect information about you when you register for an account, create or modify your profile, set preferences, sign-up for a subscription or make purchases through the Services. For example, we collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, browser information, and, in some cases, billing information, company name, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you accept that some content and/or information in those accounts ("Third Party Account Information") may be transmitted into your account with us if you authorize such transmissions, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Notice. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features. We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you cannot be individually identified, and provide that anonymous information to our partners.</p>

<p><strong>Content you provide through our features:</strong> **We collect and store content that you post, send, receive and share while using our Services’ features. This content includes any information about you that you may choose to provide. Examples of content we collect and store include: The comments you write, the product Collections you create, the messages, files and links you send to other users via our messaging feature. </p>

<p><strong>Content you provide through our</strong> <strong>websites<em>*</strong>:</em>* We collect other content that you submit to websites owned or operated by us, which include social media or social networking websites operated by us. For example, you provide content to us when you provide feedback or when you participate in any interactive features, surveys, contests, promotions or events.  </p>

<p><strong>Information you provide through our support channels:</strong> The Services also include our customer support, where you may choose to submit information regarding a problem you are experiencing with the Services. Whether you contact our support via email, social media or support chat, speak to one of our representatives directly or otherwise engage with our support team, you may be asked to provide contact information, a description of the problem you are experiencing, and any other documentation, screenshots or information that would be helpful in resolving the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Payment information<em>*</strong>:</em>*  <strong>**</strong>We collect payment and billing information when you register for certain paid Services. For example, we ask you to provide payment information, such as billing address and payment card details, which we collect via secure payment processing services.</p>

<p><strong>Information needed to verify user identity for paying out the earnings:</strong>  This type of information collection is limited to the users who earn money through the Services, either by selling their artwork or by participating in Iconfinder’s <a href="http://support.iconfinder.com/user-account-management/how-does-the-referral-program-work">referral program</a> (Earner). Before making the first payout to the Earner, we ask to provide the personal identification document to verify the identity of the Earner. We may store this Personal Information for a reasonable amount of time needed to process the verification. We delete the personal identification document within a reasonable amount of time after the verification is completed. When verifying Earners, we may ask for additional information, such as links to social media accounts or examples of work in progress to verify that contributing artists are selling their original artwork. </p>

<h1>3. How we use the Personal Information</h1>

<p>Below we list the specific purposes for which we use the information about you.</p>

<h2>3.a. How we use the Personal Information you provide to us and the Personal Information collected automatically when you use the Services</h2>

<p><strong>To provide the Services<em>*</strong>:</em>* We use information about you to provide the Services to you, including to process transactions with you, authenticate you when you log in, provide customer support, and operate and maintain the Services. Your activity on the Services might be used to personalize and improve your experience with the Services. For example, the information about designers you follow may be used to send you tailored emails showcasing more content from those designers. You can always choose to opt out of these emails within the emails itself or in your notification settings. </p>

<p><strong>For Research and Development<em>*</strong>:</em>* We are continually looking for ways to make our Services faster, more intuitive and more useful to you. We use collective learnings about how people use our Services to identify trends, usage, activity patterns and areas for improvement of the Services. For example, to improve the diversity and relevance of the content on our Services, we aggregate and analyze frequently used search terms that do not return any results. </p>

<p><strong>To communicate with you about the Services:</strong> We use your contact information to send transactional communications via email and within the Services. Such communications include, but are not limited to, purchase confirmations and receipts, subscription reminders, messages from other users on the Services, questions and requests, customer support communications, and any technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative messages. We also send you communications as you onboard to the Services to help you become more proficient in using the Services. These communications are part of the Services and in most cases you cannot opt out of them. If an opt-out is available, you will find that option within the communication itself or in your notification settings. </p>

<p><strong>To promote and drive the engagement with the Services:</strong> We use your contact information and information about your activity on the Services to send promotional communications, including by email, directly displayed in the Services, or by displaying Iconfinder ads on other companies' websites and applications, as well as on platforms like Facebook and Google. The purpose of these communications is to drive engagement to the Services and increase the value you get from using the Services. These communications include but are not limited to, information about new features, offers, discounts, survey requests, newsletters, contests, and events we think may be of interest to you.  You can choose to opt out of this type of communications at any time either within the communication itself or in your notification settings. </p>

<p><strong>Customer service:</strong> We use your information to resolve technical issues you experience, to respond to your requests for assistance and to repair and improve the Services.</p>

<p><strong>For security<em>*</strong>:</em>* We use information about you and your Services’ use to screen and verify accounts and activity, to monitor suspicious or fraudulent activity and to identify violations of the Services’ terms.</p>

<p><strong>To protect our legal rights:</strong> Where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect our legal rights, interests and the interests of others, we use information about you in connection with legal claims, compliance, regulatory, and audit functions, and disclosures in connection with the acquisition, merger or sale of a business.</p>

<p><strong>To automate decision-making:</strong> We use automated systems that analyze your information to customize search results, personalize ads or tailor features to how you use our Services. We analyze your information to detect abuse such as fraud, spam, malware, and illegal content. We may also combine information collected among our and third-party Services and across your devices for the purposes described above.</p>

<p><strong>With your consent<em>*</strong>:</em>* We use information about you where you have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose not listed above. For example, with your permission, we may write down and publish user case stories to promote the Services.</p>

<h1>4. How and with whom we share the Personal Information we collect</h1>

<p>We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we do share your Personal Information with third parties as described below.</p>

<h2>4.a. Advertisers</h2>

<p>We may allow advertisers and/or merchant partners ("Advertisers") to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.</p>

<h2>4.b. Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites We Do Not Control</h2>

<p>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services’ profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services’ profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>

<h2>4.c. Agents/data processors</h2>

<p>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right and are not allowed to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.</p>

<h2>4.d. User Profiles and Submissions</h2>

<p>Certain user profile information, including, without limitation, a user’s name, username, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for Company’s Services. Your account privacy settings allow you to limit the other users who can see the Personal Information in your user profile and/or what information in your user profile is visible to others. Any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by others. Your username may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. </p>

<h2>4.e. Business Transfers</h2>

<p>We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>

<h2>4.f. Protection of Company and Others</h2>

<p>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</p>

<h2>4.g. Other Transfers</h2>

<p>Except as set forth above, you will be notified or asked for consent when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties in a personally identifiable form and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.</p>

<h1>5. How we store and secure the Personal Information we collect</h1>

<h2>5.a. Information storage and security</h2>

<p>We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records and we have implemented what we consider to be appropriate security measures, but we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>

<p>Sensitive information such as credit card details and password are stored in encrypted form. SSL is applied when transferring information and while you access the Services from a web browser.</p>

<h1>6. Information processing and transfers for EEA individuals</h1>

<h2>Legal bases for processing (for EEA individuals) **</h2>

<p>As an individual in the EEA (European Economic Area), we collect and process information about you where we have legal bases for doing so under EU laws. We only collect and use the information when:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need it to provide you the Services, including operating the Services, provide customer support and personalize features as well as for safety and security processes.</li>
<li>It serves a legitimate interest <em>(which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as for research and development, for marketing and promotion and to protect our legal rights and interests.</em></li>
<li>You have given us consent to do so for a specific purpose.</li>
<li>We need the information to comply with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have given consent to our use of your information for a specific purpose, you can change your mind at any time, but this will not affect any processing that has already taken place. You have the right to object to the use of your information, but this may mean that the Services are no longer available.</p>

<h1>7. International transfers of information</h1>

<p>Our third-party service providers may be located outside EEA which means their processing of Personal Information will involve transferring of data outside the EEA. When data is transferred outside EEA we ensure protection using the following safeguards:</p>

<ul>
<li>We only transfer Personal Information to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection of Personal Information by European Commission. Please see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/adequacy-protection-personal-data-non-eu-countries_en</li>
<li>Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/model-contracts-transfer-personal-data-third-countries_en</li>
<li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between Europe and the US. For further details, see https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en</li>
</ul>

<p>Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your Personal Information out of the EEA.</p>

<h1>8. For how long we store the Personal Information</h1>

<p>Iconfinder will process and store your Personal Information for as long as it is necessary and permitted under applicable data protection law. Your Personal Information will not be retained for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the information is collected, or the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>

<p>To determine the appropriate period for storing your Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>
