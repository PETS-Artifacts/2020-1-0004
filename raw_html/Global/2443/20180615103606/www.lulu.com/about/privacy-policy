  <p>REVISED: May 25, 2018</p>

  <p><strong>1. Data Types and Overview</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Personal Data</strong> means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, (for example, your
      name,
      address, telephone number, and e-mail address) as well as any other non-public information about you that can be
      associated with or linked to any data that allows the identification of individuals.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Anonymous Data</strong> means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data.
      Anonymous Data does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual people. We collect Personal Data and
      Anonymous Data, as described below. 
    </li>
    <li>We collect and use both Personal Data and Anonymous Data about users to (i) provide, measure, and improve the
      Services, (ii) communicate with you about your Account (as defined below) or transactions, (iii) send you
      information about changes to the Services or our policies, (iv) send you offers and promotions, (v) personalize
      content for you on the Services, (vi) detect, investigate and prevent activities that may violate our policies or
      applicable law, and (vii) as otherwise described in this Policy.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>2. How We Obtain Information</strong></p>

  <ul class="lowerAlpha">

    <li><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong><br> You do not have to provide Personal Data to use the Site.
      However, you may need to provide certain Personal Information use select Services, such as when you create a user
      account (an “Account”). When you create or update an Account, you must provide Personal Data that lets us contact
      you and deliver items purchased through the paid professional services, and when you place an order we collect
      financial details such as your bank account number and/or credit card number that allow us or our third party
      service providers to process payments (“Financial Information”) all of which we may store and use as set forth in
      this Policy. In addition, we may collect the following information in connection with the Services and
      Site: <br><br>

      <ul class="disc">

        <li>If you tell us where you are (e.g., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location), we may store
          and use that information to provide you with location-based information. This feature may be deactivated in
          the location settings of your device. 
        </li>

        <li>After you establish an account, our Site lets you store preferences like how your content is displayed, your
          location, and safe search settings. As more fully described in our <a href="/about/legal">Terms of Use</a>, we
          may associate these choices with your ID, browser or mobile device. 
        </li>

        <li>We retain information on your behalf, such as content submitted via the Services in connection with an
          order, the creation of content, or the distribution of content. 
        </li>

        <li>If you provide us feedback or contact us via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address, as well
          as any other content included in the e-mail, in order to reply. 
        </li>

        <li>If we provide the ability to post messages to the Site (i.e., a forum), the information in your posting will
          be stored on our servers and other users will be able to see it. 
        </li>

        <li>We also collect other types of Personal Data that you may provide to us voluntarily in connection with
          support for the Services, such as your operating system and version and mobile device or computer type. 
        </li>

        <li>If you participate in a survey, contest or giveaway on our Site, we may ask for your e-mail address and/or
          phone number (to notify you if you win or not). We may also ask for first and last names, and sometimes post
          office addresses to verify your identity or to send prizes. Surveys and contests are voluntary and you should
          read the rules for each contest that you enter. 
        </li>

        <li>We may also collect Personal Data at other points during your use of our Site or Services that state that
          Personal Data is being collected.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Information Collected via Technology</strong><br>We use standard online and mobile technologies to
      perform
      and improve the Services, and in some cases, these technologies provide additional information about you: <br><br>

      <ul class='disc'>
        <li><strong>Information Collected by Our Servers.</strong> To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our
          servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) collect information from you, including your
          browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to
          your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a
          date/time stamp for your visit. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Log Files.</strong> As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and
          store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider
          (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this
          information to analyze trends, administer the Services, track users’ movements around the Site, gather
          demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs.
          For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again,
          it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve information more appropriate to your
          interests. Except as noted in this Policy, we do not link this automatically-collected data to Personal Data. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cookies.</strong> “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s
          hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close
          your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you
          with a more personal and interactive experience of the Services. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pixel Tags.</strong> In addition, we use “Pixel Tags” (also referred to as clear Gifs, Web beacons,
          or Web bugs). Pixel Tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to Cookies,
          that track online movements of web users. In contrast to Cookies, Pixel Tags are embedded invisibly in Web
          pages and not stored on a user’s computer. Pixel Tags also let us to send e-mail messages in a format users
          can read, and tell us whether e-mails have been opened to ensure that we are sending only messages that are of
          interest to our users. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixel Tags to our users’ Personal Data. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Flash LSOs.</strong> When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as
          “Flash Cookies,” to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash
          Cookies are different from browser Cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored.
          Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash Cookies. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals.</strong> Users may use the Lulu Privacy Setting tool to
          customize the amount of data that they will allow Lulu to collect when the User is accessing Lulu’s Site(s) or
          Services.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Services.</strong> Other companies may set their own cookies or similar tools when you
          visit our Site or use the Services. This includes third party analytics services that we engage to help
          analyze how users use the Services. We may receive reports based on these parties’ use of these tools on an
          individual or aggregate basis. We use the information we get from Analytics Services only to improve our Site
          and Services. The information generated by the Cookies or other technologies about your use of our Site and
          Services (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services, which use Analytics
          Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer information to third
          parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their
          behalf. Each Analytics Services’ ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such
          Analytics Services’ Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. By using our Site and Services, you consent to the
          processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a
          full list of Analytics Services, please contact us at
          <a href="mailto: supportcc@lulu.com">supportcc@lulu.com</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Information Collected from Third Parties</strong> <br>
      We may receive Personal and/or Anonymous Data about
      you from companies that provide our Services by way of a co-branded or private-labeled Site or companies that
      offer their products and/or services on our Site. We may add this information to the information we have already
      collected from you as described in this Policy in order to improve the Services
    </li>

          indicate their home city, but will obtain the user’s consent prior to posting this information with the
          testimonial. We may post user feedback with a first name and last initial, or an Account handle that does not
          allow identification of the user, without obtaining advance consent. When you provide Feedback with respect to

        </ul>
      </li>

    <li><strong>Disclosure of Personal Data.</strong>
