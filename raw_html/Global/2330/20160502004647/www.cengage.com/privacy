			<h2>Privacy Statement</h2>
			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<p>Cengage Learning, and its subsidiaries and divisions, are committed to protecting the privacy and security of personal information entrusted to us on our websites. This privacy statement explains our online privacy practices.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>Scope</h3>
				<p>This privacy statement applies to the Cengage Learning, website (<a href="http://www.cengage.com">www.cengage.com</a>) and all Cengage Learning company and brand websites that link to it. Some Cengage Learning websites may have different privacy statements, so please read the privacy notice posted on each such website. For example, Cengage Learning has created a number of websites for the schools we serve, and those websites are subject to the school's own privacy policy.</p>
				<p>Additionally, some Cengage Learning websites may provide direct links to various sponsor and marketing partner sites. This privacy statement does not describe the practices of our partners. Before disclosing personal information to any other company's website, you should also read the privacy statement associated with that site.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>Information That We Collect</h3>
				<p>When you visit our website, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information such as contact and other information about your profession or your interests that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the website. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our website's content or services.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>How We Use Personal Information</h3>
				<p>In general, we use all of the information we collect in order
					to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>respond to your requests for information,</li>
					<li>provide you with products and services,</li>
					<li>determine if you are eligible to receive certain products or services,</li>
					<li>provide customer service, and</li>
					<li>provide you with additional	information that may be of interest, including marketing and
						educational materials from us and our partners.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>We will tailor the materials we provide you based on the information in your profile, such as your professional interests. Also, certain products (such as teachers' guides) are only available to qualified educational professionals, so you may not receive access to all of the services we offer if we cannot confirm your qualification.</p>
				<p>If you purchase a product from us (such as a book or newsletter subscription), you may provide us with a credit card number or other payment information. Payment information will only be used for transaction processing.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>When We Disclose Personal Information</h3>
				<p>We may also share any contact information and professional information with our affiliates or, unless you tell us not to, with third parties. For example, like most publishers, we share our subscriber lists with selected business partners so that they may offer you products and services directly. Additionally, we may share any information with third parties as needed to fulfill your requests for information, products or services.</p>
				<p class="address_indent">
					<i>If you do not want us to share your information with third parties for their own marketing, you can opt-out by deselecting the options to keep you informed about Cengage Learning products and services, or by contacting our Customer Service department by email at: <a href="mailto:cengagebrain.support@cengage.com">cengagebrain.support@cengage.com</a> or phone at +1 800.354.9706 (M - F, 8:00 am - 6:00 pm ET) and requesting the desired change (e.g., opting in or out of faxes).</i>
				</p>
				<p class="address_indent">
					<i>You can also opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us
						and our partners at any time by following the opt-out instructions
						provided on every email.</i>
				</p>
				<p>Please note that we may disclose any information as permitted or required by law, when necessary for health or safety purposes, or to protect our legal rights. For example, we may disclose information about you to our auditors or legal advisors or in response to a subpoena. We may also disclose information about you in connection with the transfer of assets of our businesses.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>A Special Note About Children</h3>
				<p>Although parts of the galeschools.com website provide information and activities for students, we do not knowingly collect any personal information about children. Teachers must provide their own personal information in order for students to participate in our online quizzes and contests.</p>
				<p>We encourage parents and teachers to spend time online with children and to monitor their online activities. Please protect your child's privacy by instructing them to never provide personal information on this site or any other, or within any software registration process, without your permission.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>Information Collected on Behalf of
					Educational Institutions</h3>
				<p>Some Cengage Learning companies administer websites that provide course materials and services for educational institutions. Information collected on these websites is only used by Cengage Learning as needed to support the educational institution and provide the services requested by the course instructors. We do not use this information for our own purposes. Most student course records are also protected by the Family and Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA). For information on your school's privacy statement and FERPA, please contact that school's administration.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>Cookies and Website Information</h3>
				<p>Like most other commercial websites, we use standard "cookie" technology and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by your web browser on your hard drive. The cookies allow our web servers to recognize the computers used to access our websites. Cookies allow you to move from page to page on the website, by remembering the information about the entire session.</p>
				<p>Information gathered through cookies and by our web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our website and the websites visited just before and just after our website.

					Information or Choices?</h3>

You should be aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in our databases. In addition, please be aware that your ability to opt-out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our website.</p>
				<hr class="faded-divider" />
				<h3>How We Secure Your Information</h3>
				<p>We have implemented reasonable technical, physical and administrative safeguards to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access or loss.

			<h2>
				Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA) Cengage Learning
				Compliance Information
			</h2>
			<div class="content-wrapper">
				<p>The Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA), effective July 1, 2010, contains requirements for publishers regarding transparency of information to prospective adopters at institutions of higher education (including both 2-year/4-year and career schools) and the availability of bundle components.</p>
				<p>Cengage Learning worked for over a year to ensure complete and timely compliance with HEOA. These efforts have included reviewing and developing processes and practices involving Marketing, Editorial, Sales, Finance and Production. Here are the details:</p>

				<h4>Transparency</h4>
				<p>HEOA requires publishers to provide prospective
					post-secondary adopters “at the time of the adoption discussion”
					with information regarding the following:</p>
				<div class="press">
					<ul>
						<li>Net and list prices</li>
						<li>Substantial changes to the content of a new edition</li>
						<li>Alternate formats</li>
						<li>Previous copyright years (to serve as an indicator of
							when the next edition might be published)</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>Cengage Learning is loading all of the required information
					onto our titles’ online product pages. This provides prospective
					adopters with direct access to all of the information centrally in
					a convenient location with which they are already familiar.</p>
				<p>We will now provide faculty with direct access to this
					information through messaging integrated into the following
					customer touchpoints which represent the various initial
					interactions we have with prospective adopters:</p>
				<div class="press">
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Review copies</strong>: Packing slips that
							accompany review copies will now refer faculty to the online
							product pages. In addition, the book’s preface contains detailed
							content changes to new editions and the title page now includes
							copyright years for up to three previous editions.</li>
						<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: All title-specific marketing
							emails will now link faculty to the title’s product page or to
							the Cengage Learning website with direction to find the required
							information by accessing the product pages in which they are
							interested.</li>
						<li><strong>Printed title-specific collateral</strong>:
							Collateral will now contain a reference to the availability of
							the required information on the online product pages and advise
							faculty to access those in their interest area.</li>
						<li><strong>Cengage Learning Website</strong>: More and more
							instructors come to the Cengage Learning site to find information
							on titles in their interest areas. They will now find the
							required information loaded onto the product pages.</li>
						<li><strong>Cengage Sales Representative pre-pub
								visits</strong>: If Cengage Sales Representatives contact instructors
							before any other touchpoint has occurred (usually in a
							pre-selling situation), they can initiate a templated faculty
							email out of the Cengage Sales Representative Database that will
							advise instructors of the availability of the required
							information on the online product pages.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<p>This is the language that Cengage Learning employs to direct
					prospective adopters to the HEOA-mandated information:</p>
				<p>
					<em>For valuable information on pricing, previous editions and
						alternate formats, visit <a
						href="http://www.cengage.com/highered/">www.cengage.com/highered</a>
						and search by ISBN, author, title, or keyword for materials in
						your area.
