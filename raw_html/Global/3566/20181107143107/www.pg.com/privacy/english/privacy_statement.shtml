	<h1><a name="how_we_collect" id="how_we_collect" tabindex="0"></a>How We Collect Your Information</h1>
<p>
    We collect information about you in many ways from many places. Some of the
    information we collect may include personal information that can be used to
    identify you; for example, your name, email address, telephone number, or
    postal address. In some countries like those in the EU, things like IP
    address or cookie and mobile device identifiers may also be considered
    personal information.
</p>
<p>
    <em><u>Please note</u></em>
    <em>
        : We may combine all of the information we collect about you to give
        you better products, services, and user experiences.
    </em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>you provide it to us.</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    You give us your information when signing up for an account on our websites
    or in mobile apps or by calling or emailing us. We may ask for things like
    your name, email or home address, date of birth, payment information, your
    age, gender, the number of people in your family, and the way you want us
    to send you information about our products and services—for example, to
    your home address, email address, or by texting you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>from sites and emails.</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    We may use technologies that automatically collect information when you
    visit our sites, view our advertisements, or use our products or services.
    For example, we use cookies (a tiny file stored on your computer’s browser)
    to tell us what browser and operating system you are using, your IP
    address, web pages you visit, links you click, or whether you have or have
    not opened an email from us.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>from mobile applications and internet connected devices.</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    To give you the best possible user experience, we may use technologies that
    collect information from your phone when you use our mobile apps or from
    “smart” devices in your home. You consent to do this when downloading the
    app or installing household internet connected devices. This information
    could include your mobile phone or other device advertising ID, information
    about your phone’s operating system, how you use the app or device, and
    your physical location. You will get a pop up notice on your phone or
    device that gives you the option to accept or reject allowing us to know
    your precise geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where you are
    accessing the internet).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>from other places. </strong>
    We may get information that other companies share with or sell to us. For
    example, you may have given consent for another company to share your
    personal information with us when you signed up for telecom services or a
    retailer loyalty points program. We may also collect information from
    places that you know everyone can see, such as from internet postings, blog
    entries, videos, or social media sites. We may also receive information
    from other companies who are in the business of collecting or aggregating
    information about you sourced from publicly available databases or from
    consent you have given to their use and subsequently our use of your
    information. This might be information about your income level, age,
    gender, number of people in your family, and products you have bought on
    the internet or from stores in your neighborhood.
</p>

</div><br>

<div class="all_grid">
    <h1><a name="how_we_use" id="how_we_use" tabindex="0"></a>How We Use Your Information</h1>
   
   <p>
    We use your information to help us meet our purpose of touching and
    improving the lives of people like you every day around the world. We use
    your information to respond to your questions or requests for information,
    send you products or samples you have requested, help you manage your
    P&amp;G site or app preferences, allow you to enter our contests or
    sweepstakes, or process your payment for the products you buy from us. We
    may also use your non-personal information (e.g., purchase data, sample
    requests, etc.) in consumer research or analytics (or personal information
    when you have consented to participate in such research) to learn more
    about what consumers want so that we can make new products or improve the
    ones we already have.
</p>
<p>
    Another way we use your information is to make sure that what you hear from
    us is relevant and useful to you as an individual. For example, we may send
    you information about Gillette® products if you have shown interest in our
    shaving products by visiting Gillette.com. When we do this, we will use
    your information – a cookie ID or device ID -- to limit the number of times
    you see the same advertisement from Gillette. We want you to hear from us
    about the products you use and love without you hearing the same message
    over and over again.
</p>
<p>
    We may also use aggregate information from many people without identifying
    any individuals to better understand how our websites are being used or to
    study consumer habits so that we can make products and offer services that
    meet the needs of all consumers sharing some of the same things in common.
    For example, we can learn a lot about consumers who are new parents reading
    our baby product websites, so that we can better serve new parents
    everywhere with the products and services they want. Use of such
    non-personal information in this way helps to safeguard your privacy. We
    will always try to use non-personal information whenever possible for this
    reason.
</p>
<p>
    To further protect your privacy, we will also use the least amount of
    information we can to accomplish the task at hand, put measures in place to
    prevent mixing information in ways that would allow cookie and device IDs
    to specifically and directly identify you (e.g., by name), and delete your
    information when we no longer need it for our business purposes.
</p>
</div><br>

<div class="all_grid">
<h1><a name="how_we_safeguard" id="how_we_safeguard" tabindex="0"></a>How We Safeguard Your Information</h1>
<p>
    We respect your personal information and take steps to protect it from
    loss, misuse, or alteration. Where appropriate, these steps can include
    technical measures like firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention
    systems, unique and complex passwords, and encryption. We also use
    organizational and physical measures such as training staff on data
    processing obligations, identification of data incidents and risks,
    restricting staff access to your personal information, and ensuring
    physical security including appropriately securing documents when not being
    used
</p>
</div><br>
<div class="all_grid">
    <h1><a name="what_we_share" id="what_we_share" tabindex="0"></a>What We Share</h1>
  <p>
    <strong>with other companies.</strong>
    <strong> </strong>
    When we have your consent, we may share your information with select
    partners so they can send you offers, promotions, or ads about products or
    services we believe you may be interested in. For example, people who
    receive P&amp;G emails from our diaper brands such as Pampers® may also
    consent to hear about baby formulas made by other companies. We do not sell
    your personal information to marketers outside of P&amp;G. We may share
    information that does not personally identify you with other companies for
    any purpose.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>with service providers.</strong>
    We may need to share your information with companies who help us run our
    business, including hosting our sites, delivering our emails to you,
    analyzing the data we collect, and sending you the products and services
    you requested. We share only the personal information needed for these
    companies to complete the tasks we request. They are required to protect
    your information in the same way we do and will not share it or use it for
    any other purpose.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <strong>other situations. </strong>
    If a brand or one of our businesses with which you’ve shared personal data
    is sold to another company, your data will be shared with that company. As
    a result, your account and the personal data in it will not be deleted
    unless you tell the brand or new company that you want it deleted. We may
    also share your information with companies who help us protect our rights
    and property, or when required by law or government authorities.

<h1><a name="cookies" id="cookies" tabindex="0"></a>Cookies</h1>
<p>
    Cookies are small files sent to your computer as you surf the web.  They store useful information about how you interact with the websites you visit.  Cookies do not collect any information stored on your computer or device or in your files.  Cookies do not contain any information that would directly identify you as a person.  Cookies show your computer and device only as randomly assigned numbers and letters (e.g., cookie ID ABC12345) and never as, for example, John E. Smith.     

</p>
<p>
    We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as:
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        to serve you with relevant advertising
    </li>
    <li>
        to learn more about the way you interact with P&amp;G content
    </li>
    <li>
        help us improve your experience when visiting our websites
    </li>
    <li>
        to remember your preferences, such as a language or a region, so there
        is no need for you to customize the website on each visit
    </li>
    <li>
        to identify errors and resolve them
    </li>
    <li>
        to analyze how well our websites are performing
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    These are the types of cookies we use:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>session cookies. </strong>
        Webpages have no memory. Session cookies remember you (using a randomly
        generated ID like: ABC12345) as you move from page to page so that you
        don’t get asked to provide the same information you’ve already given on
        the site. For example, session cookies are extremely helpful when
        shopping online—without them the items you place in your shopping cart
        would disappear by the time you reach the checkout! These cookies are
        deleted as soon as you leave our site or close your browser.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>persistent cookies.</strong>
        Persistent cookies allow sites to remember what you prefer when you
        come back again. For example, if you choose to read the site in French
        on your first visit, the next time you come back the site will appear
        automatically in French. Not having to select a language preference
        every time makes it more convenient, more efficient, and user-friendly
        for you.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>advertising cookies.</strong>
        These cookies can be used to learn about what interests you generally
        might have, based, for example, on the websites you visit and the
        products you buy. This can also help us infer things about you such
        your age, marital status, and how many kids you may have. That data
        allows us to send you ads for products and services that better fit the
        things you like or need. It also allows us to limit the number of times
        you see the same advertisement.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>analytics cookies.</strong>
        These cookies tell us how our websites are working. In many cases, we
        use Google analytics cookies to monitor the performance of our sites.
        Our ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
        about your visits to our sites is restricted by the
        <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html">
            Google Analytics Terms of Use
        </a>
and the        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google Privacy Policy</a>
        .
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong>How you can control cookies. </strong>
    You can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie
    is being sent to your computer. However, this may prevent our sites or
    services from working properly. You can also set your browser to delete
    cookies every time you finish browsing.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Other Technologies.</strong>
</p>
<ul type="disc">
    <li>
        <strong>proximity-based beacons. </strong>
        Beacons send one-way signals to mobile apps you install on your phone
        over very short distances to tell you, for example, what products are
        on-sale as you walk through a store. Beacons only talk to your device
        when you get close enough and after you have given consent within the
        mobile application associated with a particular beacon. In turn, apps
        may provide us location information to help customize advertising and
        offers to you. For example, when you are near a beacon in the skin care
section of a supermarket, we may send you a $4 off coupon.        <strong></strong>
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>pixels. </strong>
        These are small objects embedded into a web page, but are not visible.
        They are also known as "tags,” “web bugs,” or "pixel gifs." We use
        pixels to deliver cookies to your computer, monitor our website
        activity, make logging into our sites easier, and for online marketing
        activity. We also include pixels in our promotional email messages or
        newsletters to determine whether you open and act on them.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>mobile device identifiers and SDKs.</strong>
        We use software code in our mobile apps to collect information similar
        to what cookies collect on the internet. This will be information like
        your mobile phone identifiers (iOS IDFAs and Android Advertising IDs)
        and the way you use our apps. Similar to cookies, the device
        information we collect automatically as you use our apps will never
        identify you as a person. We only know a mobile device as randomly
        assigned numbers and letters (e.g., advertising ID EFG4567) and never
        as, for example, John E. Smith.
    </li>
	</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>precise geolocation.</strong>
        We may receive information about your exact location from things like
        global positioning system (GPS) coordinates (longitude and latitude)
        when you use our mobile apps. You will always get a pop-up notice on
        your phone or device asking for you to accept or reject allowing us to
        know exactly where you are in the world. You should understand that we
        will not always ask for consent to know generally that you are in a
        broader city, postal code, or province. For example, we do not consider
        it to be precise location if all we know is that you are somewhere in
        Manila, Philippines.

<h1><a name="iba" id="iba" tabindex="0"></a>Interest-Based Advertising</h1>
<p>
    When you visit our partner sites, we can show you ads or other content we
    believe you would like to see. For example, you may receive advertisements
    for Tide® laundry detergent if we notice that you are visiting sites that
    sell children’s clothing or school supplies. And from that information we
    may conclude that you have children and therefore could well be interested
    in a powerful laundry-cleaning product. In this way, we intend to send you
    relevant information about our products that might be of benefit to you.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        we learn from groups of consumers sharing similar interests.
    </strong>
    We may place you into a particular group of consumers who show the same
    interests. For example, we may put you in the group of “razor aficionados”
    if we see you frequently purchase razors online or you could be a
    “bargain-shopper” if we notice you use online coupons or look for discounts
    or sales. We notice these things about you as you look at web pages, links
    you click on our websites and other websites you visit, mobile applications
    you use, or our brand emails you view and links you click in the emails. We
    group together cookie and device IDs to help us learn about general trends,
    habits, or characteristics from a group of consumers who all act similarly
    online and/or offline. By doing this, we can find and serve many others who
    “look like” those already in the group and thereby send them what we
    believe will be relevant and beneficial product offers and information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>we link other information to your cookie and device IDs. </strong>
    Your cookie and device IDs may be supplemented with other information, such
    as information about the products you buy offline or information that you
    provide directly to us when creating an account on our sites. We generally
    do this in ways that will not directly personally identify you. For
    example, we could know that cookie ID ABC12345 belongs to the razor
    aficionado group based on person’s web site visits, age, gender, and
    shopping habits, but we would not know that person’s name or address or
    other information that would identify him or her as a person. Should we
    ever want to personally identify your cookie or device information (web and
    app viewing history), we will always ask you before doing so.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        we may know you across all of your computers, tablets, phones, and
        devices.
    </strong>
    We may know that cookie ID ABC12345 is from a computer that that may be
    connected to the same person or household owning the mobile phone with
    device ID EFG15647. This means that you may search for diapers on your
    laptop, click on a Google search result link which we have sponsored, and
    then later see an ad for our Pampers® brand diapers on your mobile phone.
    We might assume or deduce that the same person owns the computer and phone
    because, for example, they sign on to the same WiFi network every day at
    the same time. Understanding what devices seem to be used by a person or
    household helps us limit the number of times you see the same ad across all
    of your devices. And this is important because that way you don’t get
    annoyed at us for spamming you with the same ad and we don’t pay for such
    repetitive ads that we don’t want you to receive.

    browser(s), declining the “access to data” requests that apps usually
    present when you install them, or by adjusting the ad tracking settings on
    your device.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        you will still see “contextual” ads even if you opt out of
        interest-based ads.
    </strong>
    Even if we stop sending you interest-based ads, you will still get ads from
    our brands on your computer or mobile devices. These ads, however, are
    based on the context of the sites you visit and are called contextual ads.
    Unlike interest-based ads which are based on pages you visit on your mobile
    phone or computer viewing activities, contextual ads are ads shown to you
    based on the context of the specific site you are visiting. For example,
    you still may see an ad for one of our baby care brands while looking at
    nursery products online because these sites traditionally have had mostly
    new or expecting parents as visitors. You should also know that we may
    still collect information from your computer or devices and use it for
    other purposes like evaluating how our websites work, for consumer
    research, or detecting fraud.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>deleting cookies also deletes your opt out. </strong>
    When you opt out of interest-based advertising, we send an opt-out cookie
    to your browser that tells us that you no longer want to receive
    interest-based ads from us. Your opt-out cookie will be deleted if you
    decide to delete <u>all</u> cookies. This means that you will need to
    opt-out again if you still do not want to receive interest-based ads.

<p>
    This section applies only to our processing of personal data of EU country
    residents. It aims to provide increased transparency into our processing,
    retention, and transfer of EU resident personal data that is in line with
    the letter and spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation.

<p>
    <a class="Heading Black" name="entities"><strong>entities.</strong></a>
    Different P&amp;G entities may be the controller of your personal data. A
    data controller is the entity which directs the processing activity and is
    principally responsible for the data. The chart below identifies our data
    controllers for EU country data. For example, when you register for email
    on one of our French (.fr) websites, the P&amp;G entity listed next to that
    country name will be the controller of that personal data (e.g., Procter
    &amp; Gamble France SAS (LE 577).

    <strong>transfers of your data to other countries.</strong>
    Your personal information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a
    country other than the one in which it was collected, including the United
    States. For example, we may store your data on a server in the United
    States because that is where a particular database is hosted; and that data
    may be “transferred” again when one of our marketers accesses that data
    from Switzerland to send you a product sample. We perform such transfers,
    both between P&amp;G entities and between P&amp;G and our service
    providers, using contractual protections that EU regulators have
    pre-approved to ensure your data is protected (known as model contract
clauses). If you would like a copy of a transfer agreement,    <a href="mailto:euprivacy@pg.com">contact us</a>.

    <strong>children’s online privacy laws.</strong>
    We follow all applicable data protection laws when collecting personal
    information online from children. For example, in the EU we do not collect
    personal information from children under 16 years of age unless we get
    consent from a parent. Similarly, in the U.S., we obtain verified parental
    consent when collecting personal information from children younger than 13.
