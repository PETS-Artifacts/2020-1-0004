3. General Privacy Information.<br>
<br>
MarathonGuide.com makes various public forums (such as message boards, chat rooms or news groups) available to its users. When you disclose personal information in such public forums, that information can be collected and used by others in various ways, including by sending unsolicited messages. You are solely responsible for any postings you make on public forums on MarathonGuide.com, and for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. Further, the MarathonGuide.com web site contains links to partners, advertisers and third party Internet sites and services that may collect data in connection with registrations, promotions, e-commerce, etc. MarathonGuide.com is also linked to by certain partner web sites. Each of the web sites (linked from MarathonGuide.com, or linking to MarathonGuide.com) have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of MarathonGuide.com, and MarathonGuide.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. MarathonGuide.com also displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Third party advertisers (including ad-serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. However, MarathonGuide.com does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. However, by interacting with or viewing an advertisement you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the advertisement.

4. Security.<br>
<br>
MarathonGuide.com has established and maintains reasonable security procedures to protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of your personally identifiable information. We use a variety of industry-standard security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. For example, credit card numbers are encrypted in MarathonGuide.com's secure database which is located behind a firewall. Personal information and such encrypted credit card numbers collected on MarathonGuide.com are stored in a secure operating environment that is not available to the public. All credit card and registration information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. MarathonGuide.com conducts frequent site-security audits. "Perfect security," however, does not exist on the Internet. Although your privacy is very important to us, due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, MarathonGuide.com will disclose personal information about an individual user if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to comply with an applicable law or valid legal process.<br>
