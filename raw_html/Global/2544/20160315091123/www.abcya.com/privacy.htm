<br>
<br>
ABCya.com is a teacher-created web site that is intended to provide free fun and educational games kids to use under the guidance of their parents and teachers.  We recognize that visitors to our Site will include children younger than the age of 13 (“Children”).  As required by The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), we provide this privacy policy to inform parents and legal guardians (collectively, “Parents”) and other Site users about our privacy practices.<br>

This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for www.abcya.com and any other website, mobile application, or other interactive features or downloads that are operated by ABCya.com LLC ("ABCya") and that link to this Privacy Policy (the "Site”).  This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Site and does not cover information collected offline by ABCya (unless specifically stated) nor does it apply to any of our mobile apps that do not link to this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
Please review our full privacy policy below – but here are some key points to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Site does not require Children to provide their name, address, or other contact information in order to play the games on the Site. The Site, and its third party service and content providers, may collect IP address and similar device identifiers --– but only for analytical and other internal-operations purposes -- by means of cookies, beacons and other technologies.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>The Site does collect personal information from parents, teachers, and other adults when such adult subscribes to a paid account on the Site.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In order to keep the Site free, we have advertisements on the Site. We work with ad companies to facilitate the placement of these advertisements. However, we use only contextual-advertising methods and not interest-based (a/k/a “online behavioral”) advertising methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please review this Privacy Policy carefully.

<h3><a name="info_the_site_collects" id="info_the_site_collects"></a>INFORMATION THE SITE COLLECTS</h3>

<p><a name="personal_info" id="personal_info"></a>Personal Information</p>

<p>
“Personal Information” is information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (for example, first and last name, mailing address, email address, or telephone number). The Site does not generally collect name, address, or other contact information from Children, other than the limited circumstances set forth below. However, we and our third-party service and content providers may collect IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) that is associated, on a persistent or on-going basis, with the computer, mobile phone or other device used to access the Site, and which is considered Personal Information for Children. We, and our third party service and content providers, use Device Identifier information solely to support internal operations, including maintaining, securing, and analyzing the functioning of the Site and serving contextual advertisements. 
  <br>
  <br>
The Site may also, on limited occasions, collect first name and online contact information (typically, an e-mail address) of Children solely for the following purposes: 
<br>
<br>
For one-time use of that information, such as to respond directly to a specific request (for example, answering a question submitted through the Site). We delete the contact information provided from our records once it is used to fulfill the specific one-time purpose and will not use it to re-contact the Child; OR  <br>
<br>
For the sole purpose of any of the following: to protect the security or integrity of the Site; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; and, to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety. 
<br>
<br>
If the Site offers a feature that collects a Child’s Personal Information in addition to the information described above, ABCya will provide the Child's Parent prior notice of the Site’s privacy practices and obtain the Parent's consent to the collection of the Child's Personal Information. 
<br>
<br>
Please note that, as required by law, we will not condition a Child's participation in an activity on the Site on the Child's disclosing more than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.  We use Personal Information only for the purpose that it was provided and for internal purposes. 
<br>
<br>
In some cases, we will collect Personal Information from a parent, teacher, or other adult, such as in connection with his or her registration for a paid subscription with the Site, which requires payment via a payment card.  We will use Personal Information collected from adults to process the transaction and provide our products and services as applicable; to provide information, products, or services that we believe will interest you or you have agreed to receive, including information and special offers from us and our third-party business partners; to contact you regarding your account or your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to Site policies; to improve the Site, our products and services, and for our internal business purposes; and for other purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as further described in this Privacy Policy.

<p>Effective Date: This policy was updated and became effective on June 8, 2015.
<br>
<br>
ABCya.com is a teacher-created web site that is intended to provide free fun and educational games kids to use under the guidance of their parents and teachers.  We recognize that visitors to our Site will include children younger than the age of 13 (“Children”).  As required by The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), we provide this privacy policy to inform parents and legal guardians (collectively, “Parents”) and other Site users about our privacy practices.<br>

This Privacy Policy explains our privacy practices for www.abcya.com and any other website, mobile application, or other interactive features or downloads that are operated by ABCya.com LLC ("ABCya") and that link to this Privacy Policy (the "Site”).  This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Site and does not cover information collected offline by ABCya (unless specifically stated) nor does it apply to any of our mobile apps that do not link to this Privacy Policy.<br>
  <br>
Please review our full privacy policy below – but here are some key points to know:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Site does not require Children to provide their name, address, or other contact information in order to play the games on the Site.

<br>
</li>
<li>The Site does collect personal information from parents, teachers, and other adults when such adult subscribes to a paid account on the Site.<br>
<br>
</li>
<li>In order to keep the Site free, we have advertisements on the Site. We work with ad companies to facilitate the placement of these advertisements. However, we use only contextual-advertising methods and not interest-based (a/k/a “online behavioral”) advertising methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="info_the_site_collects" id="info_the_site_collects"></a>INFORMATION THE SITE COLLECTS</h3>

<p><a name="personal_info" id="personal_info"></a>Personal Information</p>

<p>
“Personal Information” is information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally (for example, first and last name, mailing address, email address, or telephone number). The Site does not generally collect name, address, or other contact information from Children, other than the limited circumstances set forth below. However, we and our third-party service and content providers may collect IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”) that is associated, on a persistent or on-going basis, with the computer, mobile phone or other device used to access the Site, and which is considered Personal Information for Children. We, and our third party service and content providers, use Device Identifier information solely to support internal operations, including maintaining, securing, and analyzing the functioning of the Site and serving contextual advertisements. 
  <br>
  <br>
The Site may also, on limited occasions, collect first name and online contact information (typically, an e-mail address) of Children solely for the following purposes: 
<br>
<br>
For one-time use of that information, such as to respond directly to a specific request (for example, answering a question submitted through the Site). We delete the contact information provided from our records once it is used to fulfill the specific one-time purpose and will not use it to re-contact the Child; OR  <br>
<br>
For the sole purpose of any of the following: to protect the security or integrity of the Site; to take precautions against liability; to respond to judicial process; and, to the extent permitted under other provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety. 
<br>
<br>
If the Site offers a feature that collects a Child’s Personal Information in addition to the information described above, ABCya will provide the Child's Parent prior notice of the Site’s privacy practices and obtain the Parent's consent to the collection of the Child's Personal Information. 
<br>
<br>
Please note that, as required by law, we will not condition a Child's participation in an activity on the Site on the Child's disclosing more than is reasonably necessary to participate in such activity.  We use Personal Information only for the purpose that it was provided and for internal purposes. 
<br>
<br>
In some cases, we will collect Personal Information from a parent, teacher, or other adult, such as in connection with his or her registration for a paid subscription with the Site, which requires payment via a payment card.  We will use Personal Information collected from adults to process the transaction and provide our products and services as applicable; to provide information, products, or services that we believe will interest you or you have agreed to receive, including information and special offers from us and our third-party business partners; to contact you regarding your account or your use of the Site and, in our discretion, changes to Site policies; to improve the Site, our products and services, and for our internal business purposes; and for other purposes as disclosed at the time you provide your information, with your consent, and as further described in this Privacy Policy.
