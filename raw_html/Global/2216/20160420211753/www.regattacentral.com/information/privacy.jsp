					<b><i>Disclosure to overseas recipients</i></b> <br />
					<b><i> </i></b> <br />We may disclose your Personal Information to
					overseas recipients such as host organisations, governing bodies,
					clubs or event organisers which may be located in Australia,
					Canada, England, Germany, Belgium, Italy or the United States of America
					when you have sought our assistance to participate in an event or
					program or where disclosure is required for verification purposes.
					As such, the location of these overseas recipients will depend on
					the specific events or programs to which you apply or where such
					verification is required. <br /> <br />The information disclosed to
					overseas recipients consists of any information you have given to
					us to provide the relevant services. By accepting services from us,
					you consent to us providing your Personal Information to the

					<b>5. </b><b>The steps we take to protect and keep secure the
						Personal Information we hold</b> <br />
					<b> </b> <br />We take reasonable steps to protect the Personal
					Information we hold against interference, loss, unauthorised
					access, use, modification or disclosure, and other misuse. <br /> <br />The
					steps we take include: <br /> <br />&#183; maintenance of computer
					and network security measures such as including firewalls, use of
					password and other appropriate measures where information is held
					in electronic form; <br /> <br />&#183; regular updates to security
					systems to protect our systems from malicious software; <br /> <br />&#183;
					restriction of access to data to only those staff that need access
					to carry out our business activities; <br /> <br />&#183; training
					and ensuring that all our employees are required, as a condition of
					employment, to treat Personal Information held by us as
					confidential; <br /> <br />&#183; whenever we collect Sensitive
					information such as credit card data, that information is encrypted
					and transmitted to us in a secure way using secure socket layer
					technology (SSL). You can verify this by looking for a closed lock
					icon at the bottom of your web browser, or looking for
					&#8216;https&#8217; at the beginning of the address of the web
					page. <br /> <br />You should however, be aware that if you submit
					information to us electronically the internet is not a secure
					environment. We take reasonable steps to provide a secure channel
					for receiving information but cannot absolutely protect Personal
					Information before it reaches us.  If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at support@regattacentral.com<br /> <br />We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. When the Personal
					Information that we collect is no longer required, we will destroy,
					delete it in a secure manner, or ensure that the information is
					de-identified in accordance with our information destruction and
					de-identification policy, unless we are required by law to retain a
					copy of the Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. <br /> <br />
					<b>6. </b><b>How individuals can access and correct their
						Personal Information held by us</b> <br />
					<b> </b> <br />You have the right to seek access to any of your
					Personal Information held by us unless there is a valid reason
					under an applicable privacy law for us to withhold the information.
					<br /> <br />Valid reasons include where: <br /> <br />&#183; we
					have reason to suspect that unlawful activity or misconduct of a
					serious nature has been engaged in and giving access would be
					likely to prejudice the taking of appropriate action in relation to
					the matter; or <br /> <br />&#183; giving access would reveal
					evaluative information generated within us in connection with a
					commercially sensitive process; or <br /> <br />&#183; giving
					access would have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of other
					individuals; or <br /> <br />&#183; giving access would be
					unlawful. <br /> <br />If your personal details change, or you
					believe the information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete
					or out-of-date, please contact us so that we can correct our
					records or you can make the change on your Account Information
					page. <br /> <br />Requests for access, deletion or correction to
					Personal Information should be addressed to the RegattaCentral
					Privacy Officer. All requests for access, deletion or correction to
					Personal Information will be responded to in writing within a
					reasonable period of time. As part of this process we will verify
					the identity of the individual requesting the information prior to
					providing access or making any changes. If access, deletion or
					correction to your Personal Information is refused we will provide
					reasons for our refusal. <br /> <br />
					<b>7. </b><b>Mechanisms for complaint if you are unhappy about
						how we have dealt with or are dealing with your Personal
						Information</b> <br />
					<b> </b> <br />We have procedures in place to deal with your
					inquiries or complaints. <br /> <br />If you have any questions
					about our policy or any complaint regarding the treatment of your
					privacy by us, please contact us at the respective addresses below.
