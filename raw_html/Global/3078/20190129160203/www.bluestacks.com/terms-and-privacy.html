<h2 id="change"><b>Will these Terms ever change?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with the Services.  We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will bring it to your attention by placing a notice on the website (https://www.bluestacks.com/terms.html), by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services.  However, if you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and BlueStacks.</span></p>
<h2 id="about"><b>What about my privacy?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueStacks takes the privacy of its users very seriously.  For the current BlueStacks Privacy Policy, please click </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/privacy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under 13.  We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under 13; if you are a child under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us.  If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at eula at bluestacks dot com.</span></p>
<h2 id="what"><b>What are the basics of using BlueStacks?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be required to download and install certain software to your mobile device or computer, and sign up for an account, and select a password and user name (“BlueStacks User ID”).  You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not select as your BlueStacks User ID a name that you don’t have the right to use, or another person’s name with the intent to impersonate that person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf).   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you.  If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will not share your account or password with anyone, and you must protect the security of your account and your password.  You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</span></p>

<h2 id="point"><b>What is BlueStacks Store and BlueStacks Points?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueStacks Store is part of our Services. Please refer to our webpage (https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005549003) for more details about the BlueStacks Store program governed by these Terms (the “BlueStacks Store”). </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free BlueStacks Points </span><br />
We endeavor to reward and thank you for being a loyal user of our Services through the Free BlueStacks Points program. We may, but have no obligation to, grant you any BlueStacks Points free of charge (such point, “Free BlueStacks Points”). You can redeem the Free BlueStacks Points you earned for certain goods, products, or items on the BlueStacks Store.  A Free BlueStacks Point is not cash or a cash equivalent and cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents. You may not transfer your Free BlueStacks Points to another individual unless otherwise required by applicable laws.<br />
We reserve the right to change, modify and/or eliminate Free BlueStacks Points and the terms applicable thereto at any time upon notice to you (which may be provided through the Services or by modifying these Terms).  We reserve the right to terminate your participation in the Free BlueStacks Point program if we determine in our reasonable discretion that you have violated these terms or that the use of your Free BlueStacks Point is unauthorized, deceptive, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paid BlueStacks Points </span><br />
If your Free BlueStacks Points are not sufficient to redeem one item, you may purchase additional BlueStacks Points as described below. We allow you to pay for BlueStacks Points through BlueStacks App Player or BlueStacks.com website (such points, “Paid BlueStacks Points”).  Paid BlueStacks Points you purchased will be credited to your BlueStacks account within 24 hours. With Paid BlueStacks Point, you can redeem additional goods, products, or items on the BlueStacks Store. The dollar value that you paid for your Paid BlueStacks Points is a prepayment only for the redemption of goods available for redemption on our platform via the Services. No credit card, credit line, overdraft protection or deposit account is associated with your BlueStacks Points account.  No interest, dividends or any other earnings on funds deposited in your account for Paid BlueStacks Points will accrue or be paid or credited to you by Bluestacks. The value associated with your BlueStacks Points is not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).</li>

</ul>
<p>You can pay for Paid BlueStacks Points by using a payment method accepted by  the Bluestacks Store. We reserve the right to submit your transaction or redemption history as evidence of funds being used to the disputing bank, in the event you dispute or attempt to chargeback any charge for Paid BlueStacks Points with your bank or card provider. Holders of any Paid BlueStacks Points are not sent statements of itemized transactions from us. You can check the balance of your Paid BlueStacks Points through the Services. We reserve the right not to accept or otherwise limit use of any Paid BlueStacks Points if we reasonably believe that the use is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful.</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Refund of Paid BlueStacks Points</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can request a refund of all the Paid BlueStacks Point(s) you acquired in a single purchase within 48 hours of such purchase, provided that none of such Paid BlueStacks Point(s) has been used. Unless permitted by the foregoing sentence or otherwise required by law, any amount you paid for your Paid BlueStacks Points is nonrefundable and may not be redeemed for cash. For clarity, if all or part of your Paid BlueStacks Point(s) in a single purchase has been used to redeem any item on our platform, none of the Paid BlueStacks Point(s) in the same purchase can be refunded. The refund will be applied to the purchaser’s original method of payment. For refund of any eligible Paid BlueStacks Points, please contact us at fulfillment at bluestacks dot com</p>
<p>We do not charge any fees for the opening, activation or use of your BlueStacks Points account. The dollar value in your Paid BlueStacks Points has no expiration date.  Please note, however, that if you have not redeemed the value in your Paid BlueStacks Points for a certain period of time after such value was added, applicable law may require us to remit such value to the state in which the purchasing user was or is located, or the state in which Bluestacks is incorporated. This time period will vary from state to state; it may be as short as one year. Accordingly, please remember to use your Paid BlueStacks Points in a timely manner. You release us from any liability in connection with its compliance with laws applicable in this regard.</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Item Redemption; Cancellation. </span><br />
You may redeem an item with all BlueStacks Points from the BlueStacks Store. You may also purchase an item from the BlueStacks Store by using a payment method through the Bluestacks Store, without using any BlueStacks Points. If you don’t have enough BlueStacks Points to redeem an item, you may purchase additional Paid BlueStacks Points and redeem the item with all BlueStacks Points.You can cancel your order for a physical item by contacting us at fulfillment at bluestacks dot com within 24 hours of your order for a full refund. Digital items are eligible for refund within 48 hours after redemption. Refund will be made in the same form as the original order.  Except as permitted by the foregoing or otherwise required by law, no other order is cancellable or refundable.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delivery of Redeemed Item</span><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you redeem a digital item on our platform, the item will be delivered and made available to you within 24 hours. You may access your order(s) from the My Orders page inside the BlueStacks Store. Some digital items may be redeemed more than once and each redemption is considered a separate transaction.<br />
When you redeem a physical item on our platform, we’ll ask for your mailing address to verify such address so that we can properly deliver the item you redeemed. If we are unable to verify your mailing address, we’ll notify you via email to correct the mailing address.  Please promptly respond to such email. If we don’t hear from you within 15 days after the initial email, we will send you a reminder email notifying you of the problem with the mailing address. If we don’t hear from you within 24 hours after the reminder email, we will send you a final reminder email. If we still don’t hear from you within 24 hours after the final reminder email, we will have to cancel your order. An order cancellation email will be sent to you and any BlueStacks Points used to redeem such item will be credited back to your BlueStacks account.<br />
After we successfully verified your mailing address, we’ll send your order to our fulfillment center, which will aim to ship out your redeemed item within 72 hours of their receipt of the order.  Please note that delivery of a redeemed item may take some time (in rare cases, longer than 30 days) to arrive to your address, depending on various factors out of our control, such as the carriers’ speed and delivery timeframe, and customs processing time. Any delivery time notified to you is estimate only. BlueStacks does not promise any delivery time, and is not responsible for any delay or seizure by the customs of any item.<br />
If you have any questions regarding the order delivery status, please feel free to contact us at fulfillment at bluestacks dot com. Please inspect any item upon its delivery, and report any damaged item without 24 hours of its delivery.  All such notifications should be sent to fulfillmentfulfillment at bluestacks dot com, accompanied with a detailed description and picture(s) or video(s) of the damaged item. If we verified that an item is not received by you due to carrier misplacement or customs seizure, we may ship you a replacement item in our reasonable discretion.<br />

<h2 id="card"><b>What is Bluestacks’ Card Program?</b></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We endeavor to reward and thank you for being a loyal user of our Services through the Bluestacks card(s) (the “Card”).  The term “Card” used in these Terms in the singular, where the context so permits, shall be deemed to include the plural and vice versa.</p>
<p>You can earn the Card by performing certain tasks within our Services. You may also use BlueStacks Points to purchase the Card, either individually or in packs of random selection, from the BlueStacks Store.  A Card is not cash or a cash equivalent and cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalents. You may not transfer your Cards to another individual unless specifically permitted herein or otherwise required by applicable laws.</p>
<p>Some of the Cards might be or become useful in games available on our platform now or in the future. We’ll specify the terms for such Cards on the page where you can acquire them.</p>
<p>Some of our Services allow users to interact with each other to buy and sell Cards for BlueStacks Points (the “Marketplace”). You may purchase a Card from other users for the number of BlueStacks Points they set for the sale of such Card. If you want to sell any Card, you may set the price for such Card (in the form of BlueStacks Points) in your sole discretion and offer it for sale in the Marketplace. You can withdraw the sales offer at any time before another user purchases your Card. However, all sales are final, once a sale completes there is no mechanism to undo the sale and restore the Cards to their original owners.</p>
<p>Some of our Services allow users to interact with each other to trade their Cards for other Cards (the “Trading Square”). You may choose, at your sole discretion, to offer one or more of your Cards for trade and select what Card(s) you will need to receive to complete the trade.  You don’t need to always trade one Card or another Card. You may trade multiple Cards for one Card, or vice versa. You can withdraw the trading offer at any time before another user offers the requested Cards for your trading offer. However, all trades are final, once a trade completes there is  no mechanism to undo the trade and restore the Cards to their original owners.</p>
<p>Bluestacks only acts as an independent platform for any transaction through the Marketplace and the Trading Square, is not involved in any transactions between users, and does not act as a provider or a purchaser (or agent for providers or purchasers) with respect to any such transactions. Please use caution, common sense, and practice safe trading when dealing with other users or otherwise using the Services. We have no control over, and assume no responsibility for, the sales, trading, or transactions by any third party that you interact with through the Services.  You agree that Bluestacks shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between users on our Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that Bluestacks is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release Bluestacks, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “&#8221;A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="services"><b>Your use of the Services is subject to the following additional restrictions:</b></h2>
<p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including BlueStacks);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violates any law or regulation, including any applicable export control and data privacy laws;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, offensive, graphically violent, pornographic, or otherwise objectionable;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeopardizes the security of your BlueStacks account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes, or attempt to post or transmit any information that constitutes a virus, bug, malicious code, or other harmful item;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services. BlueStacks has a zero-tolerance policy against child pornography and will terminate any account and make reports to the appropriate law enforcement authorities about any user who publishes or distributes child pornography. </span></p>
<h2 id="rights"><b>What are my rights in BlueStacks?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, audio media, videos, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions, and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including BlueStacks’) rights. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</span></p>
<h2 id="have"><b>Do I have to grant consent to BlueStacks to communicate with me?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge that our collection, use, and sharing of your information is subject to our </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/privacy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="grant"><b>Do I have to grant any licenses to BlueStacks or to other users?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” The Services may allow you to share your User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that other users can view. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that the following license is subject to our </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/privacy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For your User Submissions, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services, you hereby grant BlueStacks a license to use, display, reproduce, distribute and otherwise exploit and act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to make that User Submission accessible to all BlueStacks users and to enable us to operate the Services, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that User Submission in connection with the Services and our business. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access your User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, you understand and agree that BlueStacks, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</span></p>
<h2 id="see"><b>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like BlueStacks, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/copyrights.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">click here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</span></p>
<h2 id="third"><b>Third Party Services:</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You acknowledge and agree that the Services operate on or with or using application programming interfaces (APIs) and/or other services or technology provided by third parties, and the Services may enable you to access and use third party websites, content, materials, apps or services (all of the foregoing, “Third Party Services”), and may contain links or connections to such Third Party Services that are not owned or controlled by BlueStacks. Third Party Services may be subject to limitations, delays, and other problems inherent in the use of such Third Party Services. Your right to use Third Party Services is governed by the terms of the license agreements for Third Party Services specified by such third party and not under this Terms of Use. BlueStacks is not responsible for the operation of any Third Party Services nor the availability or operation of the Services to the extent such availability and operation is dependent upon Third Party Services. You are solely responsible for procuring any and all rights necessary for you to access Third Party Services and for complying with any applicable terms or conditions thereof. BlueStacks does not make any representations or warranties with respect to Third Party Services or any third party providers. Any exchange of data or other interaction between you and a third party provider is solely between you and such third party provider and is governed by such third party’s terms and conditions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you access Third Party Services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that BlueStacks is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each Third Party Services that you visit or utilize. BlueStacks has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any Third Party Services or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, BlueStacks will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any Third Party Services. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals.

You agree that BlueStacks shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that BlueStacks is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release BlueStacks, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</span></p>
<h2 id="will"><b>Will BlueStacks ever change the Services?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice. </span></p>
<h2 id="does"><b>Does BlueStacks cost anything?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our Services are currently free. We reserve the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services. To the extent that certain of our Services may be subject to payments now or in the future (the “Paid Services”), the following terms apply: </span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Billing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you through a payment account linked to your BlueStacks account on the Services (your “Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to these Terms. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge your chosen payment provider (your “Payment Method”). You agree to make payment using that selected Payment Method. We reserve the right to correct any errors or mistakes that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.<br />
If the Payment Processor identifies or we otherwise believe that your transaction may pose an unacceptable level of risk, that you have breached these Terms, or that your account has been compromised, we may take various actions to avoid liability and reduce potential fraud and disputes. The actions we may take (and we expressly reserve the right to take) include, but are not limited to, suspending or limiting your ability to purchase any Paid Services, refusing or rejecting your transaction, or blocking you from accessing or using some or part of the Services (especially for users with a record of fraudulent transactions, requesting refunds on multiple occasions without valid reasons, having caused chargebacks, or otherwise posing high risks). If possible, we will provide you with advance notice of our actions and resolution steps. However, advance notice will not be provided if there is an immediate need to take actions such as a security threat, potential fraud, or illegal activity.<br />
</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Payment Method</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The terms of your payment will be based on your Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between you and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of your chosen Payment Method. If we, through the Payment Processor, do not receive payment from you, you agree to pay all amounts due on your Billing Account upon demand.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Current Information Required</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You must provide current, complete and accurate information for your billing account.  You must promptly update all information to keep your billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address, credit card number, or credit card expiration date) through your BlueStacks account, and you must promptly notify us or our payment processor if your payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your user name or password.  Changes to such information can be made through your BlueStacks account. If you fail to provide any of the foregoing information, you agree that we may continue charging you for any use of Paid Services under your billing account unless you have terminated your Paid Services by means of sending us an email to premium dot support at bluestacks dot com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Change in Amount Authorized</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If the amount to be charged to your Billing Account varies from the amount you preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), you have the right to receive, and we shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your Payment Method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reaffirmation of Authorization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Your non-termination or continued use of a Paid Service reaffirms that we are authorized to charge your Payment Method for that Paid Service. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you. Your charges may be payable in advance or as otherwise described when you initially selected to use the Paid Service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Subscription Services. </b></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Good standing:</strong> BlueStacks reserves the right to offer the premium subscription version of the Services (“Subscription Services”) to you only if you are a customer in good standing. BlueStacks reserves the right to refuse Subscription Services for any other reason including but not limited to a) your creditworthiness, b) you have purchased Subscription Services and cancelled them frequently in the past, or c) you have disputed payments for Subscription Services with your credit card company without pursuing the nominal cancellation process through premium dot support at bluestacks.com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fees and Payments.</strong> You agree to pay the subscription fees and any other charges (including any applicable taxes) incurred in connection with using software and Services at the rates in effect when the charges were incurred. The subscription fees stated at the time of purchase will be charged to your credit card. As soon as BlueStacks has received full payment, your paid premium subscription will begin. BlueStacks will bill all charges automatically to your credit card. Subscription fees will be billed at the beginning of your subscription period or any renewal. Unless BlueStacks states in writing otherwise, all fees and charges are nonrefundable. BlueStacks may change the fees and charges then in effect, or add new fees or charges, by giving you notice in advance. If you want to use a different credit card or there is a change in credit card validity or expiration date, please respond to the subscription confirmation email to make changes. If you believe someone has accessed Services using Your user name and password without Your authorization, please contact premium dot support at bluestacks dot com. You are responsible for any fees or charges incurred to access Services through an Internet access provider or other third-party service.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Auto-Renewal.</strong> Unless you opt out of auto-renewal, which can be done through your BlueStacks account any subscription services you have signed up for will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of the same duration as the subscription term originally selected, at the then-current non-promotional rate. To change or resign your subscription services at any time, go to your BlueStacks account.  If you terminate a subscription service, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Cancellation.</strong> For annual subscriptions, BlueStacks will contact you within a reasonable time before the expiry of your subscription term to give you the opportunity to cancel or opt out of the renewal of your subscription for a further year. If you fail to opt out, your subscription will automatically renew on the subscription expiry date, at the then current yearly subscription rate, and you will be charged accordingly, except as otherwise required by law. For all subscriptions, you must cancel your subscription before it renews in order to avoid billing of subscription fees for the renewal term to your credit card. BlueStacks may cancel your subscription at any time by notifying you. You may cancel your subscription by contacting our Customer Support at premium dot support at bluestacks dot com.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Refund.</strong> If you cancel a yearly subscription before 30 days after the subscription start date, you will generally be entitled a full refund for any reason. If you cancel a yearly subscription between 2 and 6 months after the subscription start date, you will generally be entitled to a pro rata refund for any unused months.  No refund will be paid (and no cancellation fee will apply) in relation to month-to-month subscriptions, trial subscriptions, or yearly subscriptions cancelled after 6 months of the subscription start date.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="stop"><b>What if I want to stop using BlueStacks? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’re free to uninstall the BlueStacks software at any time; please refer to our </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/privacy.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Privacy Policy </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueStacks is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. BlueStacks has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately at premium dot support at bluestacks dot com – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitation of Liability</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL BLUESTACKS (OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR (B) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) $100 OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO BLUESTACKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (C) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Assignment</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without BlueStacks’ prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Choice of Law; Arbitration</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction. For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Santa Clara County, California. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Term and Termination</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Unless otherwise provided in a written agreement between you and BlueStacks, any licenses granted by BlueStacks to you in connection with your use of the Services is effective until terminated.

Upon the termination, you shall cease all use of the Services (including any software) and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the software.

<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">e) Geo-location Information</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When you use a location-enabled app and if you have opted in for the app to access your location, we may collect, process and retain information about your actual location. We may use geo-location information to the greatest extent permitted by law. Some devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). We may also use various technologies to determine location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers. The location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used by us to provide and improve location based products and services. By using a location-enabled app, you consent to us processing information about your actual location.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave the websites of our Services.  Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites.  Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.</span></p>
<p><b>Will BlueStacks Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">provided certain Personal Information may be transferred in connection with business transfers, as described below. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</span></p>
<p><b>Information that’s no longer personally identifiable.  </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide anonymized information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To gain a better understanding of how our users use our Services, BlueStacks may track user actions (such actions may include, without limitation, downloads completed successfully; installations completed successfully; Android apps installed successfully; Android apps started successfully; Android apps failed to start; and Android apps started but failed midstream) and record or report them over the Internet to a central analytics database.  We use Google Analytics to grow our business, to improve or develop our products, to monitor and analyze use of our Services, for our technical administration, to increase the functionality and user-friendliness of our Services, and to verify that users have the authorization needed for us to process their requests. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, visit http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html. You can opt out of the Google Analytics by visiting </span><a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"><span style="font-weight: 400;">http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><b>Advertisers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We allow advertisers and/or merchant partners (“Advertisers”) to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers and you agree that we may provide any of the information we have collected from you in non-personally identifiable form to an Advertiser, in order for that Advertiser to select the appropriate audience for those advertisements and/or offers. For example, we might use the fact you are located in San Francisco to show you ads or offers for San Francisco businesses, but we will not tell such businesses who you are.  Or, we might allow Advertisers to display their ads to users with similar usage patterns to yours, but we will not disclose usage information to Advertisers except in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Note that if an advertiser asks us to show an ad to a certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that ad, the advertiser may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they were trying to reach.</span></p>
<p><b>Affiliated Businesses:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us).  You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</span></p>
<p><b>Agents:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use certain third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve our Services (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics and payment processing) for purposes of and under obligations to adequately safeguard the information.  Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us or perform the tasks on our behalf. </span></p>
<p><b>User Profiles and Submissions:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Certain user profile information, including your name, location, and any video or image content that such user has uploaded to the Services, may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Services or address your request for our services.    Please remember that any content you upload to your public user profile, along with any Personal Information or content that you voluntarily disclose online in a manner other users can view (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, etc.) becomes publicly available, and can be collected and used by anyone.  Your user name may also be displayed to other users if and when you send messages or comments or upload images or videos through the Services and other users can contact you through messages and comments. Again, we do not control the policies and practices of any other third party site or service.</span></p>
<p><b>Business Transfers:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. </span></p>
<p><b>Compliance with Laws; Protection of BlueStacks and Others:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we reasonably believe is necessary to (a) comply with law or court order; (b) enforce or apply our </span><a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/terms.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terms of Use</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and other agreements; (c) or protect the rights, property, or safety of BlueStacks, our employees, our users, or others; or (d) prevent fraud or abuse of Bluestacks, our employees, our users, or others. </span></p>
<p><b>Is Personal Information about me secure</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service.  You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.  If we receive instructions using your BlueStacks account information we will consider that you have authorized the instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records. But unfortunately, no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee complete security.  Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. </span></p>
<p><b>What Personal Information can I access</b><b>?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please keep your information up to date and accurate. Through your account settings or by using features of our Services, you may access, and, in some cases, edit or delete the following information you’ve provided to us:</span></p>
