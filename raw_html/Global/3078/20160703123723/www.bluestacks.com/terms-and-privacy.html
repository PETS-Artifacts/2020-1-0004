<p>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices and let us know if you have any questions.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to your use of (regardless of means of access) any of the current set of products from Bluestacks, collectively referred to as Bluestacks Products, such as the Bluestacks website (bluestacks.com), the Bluestacks App Player for Windows, the Bluestacks App Player for Mac, the Bluestacks Cloud Connect Android app, the GamePop Console, the GamePop Android App, the GamePop iOS App, the FoneLink Android app, the FoneLink iOS app, the FoneLink Web app, the FoneLink Windows 8 app, the BlueStacks Cloud Services, and the Bluestacks Help and Support forum.

<p>You can access, download or use Bluestacks Products, through applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third parties. A Device is any computer used to access the Bluestacks Products, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic Device.</p>
<p>Bluestacks Products can enable you to sync information from your Android phone to another Device you own; play applications developed by third parties, individually and collectively referred to as Third Party Apps, on a Device, such as an Android app on a Device running either the Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X or Linux operating systems.</p>
<h4>1) Information we collect from you</h4>
<p>All of the different forms of data, content, and information, including that which can be used to identify an individual, as described below are collectively referred to as Information. We collect Information to provide better services to all of our users from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like how to provide the best user experience for using BlueStacks Products on your particular Device.</p>
<p>We collect Information in two ways:</p>
<p>A) Information you give us: In the course of you using the Bluestacks Products, we may collect Information with your consent that can be used to contact or identify you (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;).</p>
<p>When you use FoneLink through your Google account login, we may collect Personal Information such as your name, email address, phone number, and ancillary information such as phone call history, contacts, SMS messages, mobile applications installed on your phone, so that you can view and use such information on other Devices you own.</p>
<p>When you register for a Bluestacks account, we may collect some Personal Information such as your email address, or social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services, or your phone number. You may be asked to choose login Information, such as your email address and a password, which will be used to access your account. You may also provide us ancillary information such as your friends’ email addresses for inviting your friends to use Bluestacks Products or sharing your experience of using such Bluestacks Products with them. If you provide us with Information about another person you represent that you have their permission to do so.</p>
<p>If you contact us via email or our electronic Help Forum, we may collect some Personal Information such as email address and contact information, and also keep your message to respond to your request.</p>
<p>B) Information we get from your use of Bluestacks Products: We (or our service providers acting on our behalf) may collect Information about the Bluestacks Products that you use and how you use them.

Some Analytics may be correlated with your Personal Information. Usage Information may include:</p>
<p>a) Device Information: We may collect Device-specific Information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique Device identifiers and mobile network Information including phone number). We may associate your Device identifiers or phone number with your Bluestacks Account.</p>
