<br />
<b>1. Introduction</b><br />
<br />
<b>1.1</b> Journal Media Limited (‘we’, ‘us’ ‘our’) is committed to protecting your Personal Data. This Privacy Notice applies to your use of the websites and applications: TheJournal.ie, The42, FORA, DailyEdge, and Boards.ie (each, a <b>“Site”</b>) and sets out how we collect, use and protect your personal data. If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Notice, please do not use the Sites.<br />
<br />
<b>1.2</b> This notice (<b>“Notice”</b>) has been developed to inform our users about the privacy and security of personal data and to meet our obligations under the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation (the <b>“Data Protection Law”</b>). Under Data Protection Law, personal data is information that identifies you as an individual or is capable of doing so (<b>“Personal Data”</b>).<br />

<br />
<b>2.3</b> We gather Personal Data when you have logged in with a social media account, when you open an account or when you have provided us with Personal Data; for example, by contacting us via email, private message or through a Site.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>3. What kinds of Personal Data do we collect?</b><br />
<br />
<b>3.1</b> We receive and store information you enter on a Site or give us in any other way, including when registering for a commenting account, installing an application, subscribing to a mailing list, making a purchase, as well as provided in your comments, posts and requests.<br />
<br />

<br />
<b>3.3</b> If, during your use of a Site, you post comments, we will keep a record of your commenting history.<br />
<br />
<b>3.4</b> The Sites create a user profile when you install an application. We will collect or process data you provide to us in the course of creating or updating a user profile. This information will vary but typically includes your device ID, the versions of our apps you have installed on your device, your reading interests in our Sites.<br />
<br />
<b>3.5</b> If you register with Boards.ie we collect the information you supply on registration as well as any other information you provide to us by email or private message.

<br />
<b>3.10</b> For full details on Personal Data and posts, please refer to individual sites’ Terms of Use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>4. Legal basis for processing</b><br />
<br />
Given the varied functionality of each Site we rely on the following legal bases under Data Protection Law in processing your Personal Data:<br />
<br />
<div class="table"><table><tr><td><b>Legal Basis</b>            </td><td> <b>Example</b><br /></td></tr><tr><td>Performance of a contract</td><td>We will process your Personal Data to the extent required to deliver the service requested.<br /></td></tr><tr><td>Compliance with legal obligations</td><td> We may need to disclose Personal Data to comply with a request from law enforcement, or other government agencies or court order.<br /></td></tr><tr><td>Legitimate interests</td><td> We may need to disclose Personal Data in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any comment or content posted by that user. We may process Personal Data to personalise content or advertisements.</td></tr></table></div><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>5. How we may use your Personal Data</b><br />
<br />
<b>5.1</b> Except as disclosed in this Privacy Notice, we will not disclose Personal Data that we collect to any parties other than those with whom we partner or are affiliated with, without your consent. Except as disclosed below, we will not sell, share, trade, rent, or give away your Personal Data.<br />
<br />
<b>5.2</b> We may use your Personal Data to process any requests made by you for example, to create a user account, subscribe to a mailing list or make a complaint about a comment/post, respond to your inquiry, and communicate with you when necessary to provide customer service and/or follow-up information related to a Site. We may also use information you provide to communicate with you about your interest in our events and our company, to help us improve, operate and enhance your experience on a Site, to promote our events, notify you about important functionality changes to a Site, new services, and special offers we think you will find valuable, to tailor advertisements, content, and other aspects of your experience on and in connection with a Site, for other administrative purposes, to prevent or detect abuses of our terms of use, for identifying, modifying or deleting nuisance or defamatory material posted by users, and to enable third-parties to carry out technical or other functions on our behalf as well as any other purpose that we may disclose to you at the point at which we request your Personal Data. We may combine non-personal information that you provide with supplemental information (including mailing address updates and demographic data) that we obtain from public sources or reputable third-parties. Information combined with personally identifiable information becomes, and is treated as, Personal Data under this Privacy Notice.<br />
<br />
<b>5.3</b> When you contact us, we may request your affirmative, positive consent to use your contact information for marketing or other business purposes. In the event you do not consent to the use of your contact information for marketing or other business purposes, your data will not be used for those purposes. If you provide your consent but subsequently do not wish to receive notifications about related opportunities, you will be able to modify your preferences by following the instructions on any marketing correspondence.<br />
<br />
<b>Other websites</b><br />
<br />
<b>5.4</b> The Site interfaces social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter, and may use social media plugins (e.g., the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button, '&quot;Share to Twitter&quot;' button) to facilitate social media functions.<br />
<br />
<b>5.5</b> If you are a member of a social media platform or website, and log in to such social media or platform, the interfaces may allow the social media platform or website to connect your visit to a Site to your Personal Data. The social media plugins also may allow the social media website to share information about your activities on a Site with other users of their social media platform. We have no control over the information that other websites or social media websites or plugins collect, store, or use. Before you choose to access other websites from a Site or “like” or share information from a Site through any social media platform or website, please be certain that you review the privacy notice of that social media platform or website.<br />
<br />
<b>Do we disclose Personal Data to anyone else?</b><br />
<br />
<b>5.6</b> We disclose customer information to third parties only when it is necessary as part of business practices or when there is a legal or statutory obligation to do so. Whenever we disclose customer information to third parties, we will only disclose that amount of information necessary to meet such business need or legal requirement. Third parties that receive customer information from us must satisfy us as to the measures taken to protect the personal data such parties receive, in accordance with Data Protection Law and as stated in this Privacy Notice. Appropriate measures will be taken to ensure that all such disclosures or transfers of customer information to third parties will be completed in a secure manner and pursuant to contractual safeguards.<br />
<br />
<b>5.7</b> We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, including processing credit card payments, marketing, and providing analytics assistance. From time to time, we may also share Personal Data or non-personally identifiable information with third-parties that we have engaged to perform certain services in connection with the operation of certain aspects of a Site, including to customise, deliver, measure, analyse, improve and support our services, content, advertising and layout, your interaction with those aspects, and to deliver more relevant messages and advertisements to you.

<b>6.6 </b>Each Site is published in Ireland and is governed by Data Protection Law and Irish law.<br />
<br />
<b>6.7 </b>We do not transfer any Personal Data outside of the EEA.
