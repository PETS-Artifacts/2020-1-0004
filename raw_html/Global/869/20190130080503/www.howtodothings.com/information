Some of this information is provided to us voluntarily by the users of the Website, and other information is collected automatically through cookies or other Internet tracking technologies.&gt;</p></li><li><p><strong><a name="2" title="2"></a>Information Collected Automatically</strong></p><p>Each time you visit the Website, your browser or internet session automatically sends to us, and we automatically collect, the following types of information:</p><ul><li>Your browser, e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator,</li><li>Your Internet domain, e.g., AOL, Netcom, Earthlink, etc.,</li><li>You computer's operating system, e.g., Windows, Macintosh, UNIX, Linux, etc.,</li><li>Your navigation path, i.e., the URLs of where you come to our site from, which of our pages you visit, and where you go as your leave (sometimes called “clickstream data”),</li><li>Your computer’s IP Address, and</li><li>A date/time stamp.</li></ul><p>This information is automatically stored in log files, and helps us analyze trends with regard to use of the Website so we can make the Website more useful.  For example, we use this information to track how users are finding the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, determine which pages are visited the most often, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  However, this information does not identify individual users.  </p></li><li><p><strong><a name="3" title="3"></a>Information You Provide to Us Voluntarily</strong></p><p>In addition, when you register as a Contributor and set up an account on the Website, we collect certain personal information, such as your first and last name and e-mail address.  However, even if you do not register as a Contributor, from time to time, we may collect information that you choose to provide to us.  For instance, you may provide us with personal information when:</p><ul><li>Requesting additional information from us or our advertisers,</li><li>Submitting questions, opinions, or other feedback regarding the Website, or</li><li>Participating in community or interactive features that we may provide on the Website.</li></ul><p>Examples of personally identifiable data that you may provide to us include name, address or other location information, email address, gender, age, marital status, occupation, and other similar personal information.</p></li><li><p><strong><a name="4" title="4"></a>How We Use Information Collected Automatically</strong></p><p>We use the information we automatically collect only in the general administration of the Website, and to help us improve the Website to better meet your information needs.</p></li><li><p><strong><a name="5" title="5"></a>How We Use Information That You Provide to Us Voluntarily</strong></p><p>Your e-mail address will be used <em><strong>only</strong></em> in the following circumstances:</p><ul><li>If a user of the Website has registered and been accepted as a Contributor, we may send notifications to the Contributor relating to the use of the Website or the article submission, editorial, or publication processes;</li><li>Provided such Contributor has given us permission to do so, we may send additional notifications of other features on the Website to the Contributor; and</li><li>If a Contributor has given us permission to do so, we may send regular notifications, periodic updates, newsletters, or other news regarding the Website, our other promotions, products, or services, or our partners and their promotions, products, or services.  </li></ul><p>If you are a Contributor or otherwise have provided your e-mail address to us when using the Website, your e-mail address will never be shared with or displayed to any other person without your prior consent.  For a description of how a user’s permission or consent is given, see “Opt-in/Opt-out Procedures” below.</p><p>We will use the other personal information you have voluntarily provided to us for marketing purposes <em><strong>only</strong></em> with your prior permission.  Otherwise, all personally identifiable information you provide is maintained in confidence.  </p><p>Except as explained above, or where you are expressly informed otherwise, we will not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information, unless required by law, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on the Website, or for the protection of a Contributor’s use of the Website or participation in the publication process.  However, we <em><strong>will</strong></em> share certain aggregate Website usage information or other aggregated demographic information about users of the Website in a <em><strong>non-personally identifiable</strong></em> manner with advertisers, partners, and other third parties in order to present to users of the Website more targeted advertising, products and services.  In such situations we will <em><strong>never </strong></em>disclose information that would personally identify you.  </p></li><li><p><strong><a name="6" title="6"></a>Opt-in/Opt-out Procedures</strong></p><p>If you become a Contributor or otherwise provide your e-mail address to us, we provide you the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information.  For example, if a Contributor registers or signs up for a promotion, contest, or other feature provided through the Website, but does not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, the Contributor can indicate his or her preference on the applicable registration or personal profile page.</p><p>If a Contributor no longer wishes to receive any of our notifications, updates, newsletters or promotional communications, he or she may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each of such communications or on his or her personal profile page.</p><p>You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent or service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.</p></li><li><p><strong><a name="7" title="7"></a>Our Security Measures</strong></p><p>The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p><p>If you have any questions about security on the Website, you can email us at <u><font color="#0000ff">admin@howtodothings.com</font></u>.</p></li><li><p><strong><a name="8" title="8"></a>Why We Use “Cookies”</strong></p><p>A “cookie” is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” or “options” file.  </p><p>If you are a Contributor, we may set a persistent cookie to store your e-mail address or password, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as promotions, contests, or surveys, will be limited.  </p><p>Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) use cookies on our site.
