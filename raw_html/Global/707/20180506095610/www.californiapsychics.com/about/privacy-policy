                    Outlook collects various types of personal information about you, both online and offline, during the course of our business relationship. Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to Outlook for information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this California Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our “family” of companies, such as those companies we own, that own us, or under common control with us. To make such a request, please send an email to privacy@californiapsychics.com.

                <div class="tab-legal-content2">
                        California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing
