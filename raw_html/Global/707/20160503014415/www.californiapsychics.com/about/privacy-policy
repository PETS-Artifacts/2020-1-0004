                        Outlook collects various types of personal information about you, both online and offline, during the course of our
                        business relationship. Under California law, if you are a resident of California, you may make a written request to
                        Outlook for information about how we have shared your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing
                        purposes during the prior calendar year, as well as a list of categories of information shared. For purposes of this California
                        Privacy Rights notice, third parties include companies within our “family” of companies, such as those companies we own, that own us,
                        or under common control with us. To make such a request, please send an email to 
                        <a href="mailto:privacy@californiapsychics.com" class="ui-link" style="font-weight: 400;text-decoration: underline;">Privacy@californiapsychics.com</a><br /><br />
                        California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing

                        Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year,
                        and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.
