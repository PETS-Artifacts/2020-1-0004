<h4>What information may we collect and access?</h4>

<p><b><span class="blue">Personally Identifiable Information</span></b><br /> We may collect personally identifiable information, including name, physical address, email address, telephone number, credit card information, and other personal information (collectively, "PII") from Customers. We may also obtain Customers&rsquo; credit report. &nbsp;If you create an account or access our Services through your account with a third party service, such as Facebook, Google or Twitter, or use a social media feature through our Service, certain PII from those third party social media services may be shared with us. We will treat this information shared with us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Any information that third party social media services collect is subject to those respective entities&rsquo; own privacy policies.</p>
<a name="section_2_2"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Your Contact Lists and Address Book</span></b><br /> If you use our Mobile Apps, we may request your permission to access and store the contact list or address book maintained on your mobile phone, tablet, or other broadband-connected device (&ldquo;Mobile Device&rdquo;). Your contact list is considered your PII. We may use your contact list information to facilitate certain Services such as to enable you to make calls easily and to facilitate free calls, texts, and other Services. We may also facilitate the delivery of messages to individuals in your contact list that you wish to invite to download our Mobile Apps so that you can utilize our Services with these selected individuals. We will not use your contact list information for other purposes without first notifying you of the proposed use. If you do not allow us to access your contact list information, certain features of our Mobile Apps may not be available to you. You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your Mobile Device&rsquo;s contact list via the Mobile App&rsquo;s privacy settings on your Mobile Device.</p>
<a name="section_2_3"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Access to Mobile Device Camera, Microphone and Photos</span></b><br /> If you use our Mobile Apps, we may request your permission to access the camera, microphone and photos on your Mobile Device.

<a name="section_2_4"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Your Precise Location Information</span></b><br /> Our Mobile Apps may collect precise information about the geographic location of your Mobile Device. If your Mobile Device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your Mobile Device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your Mobile Device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location. If you have consented, the geographic location of your Mobile Device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that the Mobile App is running (even if you are not actively using the Mobile App, it is minimized, or it is closed on your Mobile Device). Once you set your Mobile Device to transmit its location information to us, your Mobile Device will continue to transmit its location information to us until you set your Mobile Device to no longer do so. Your precise geographic location is considered your PII unless it is aggregate data and does not identify you. To the extent our Mobile Apps collect precise geographic location, you may at any time opt out from further allowing us to have access to your Mobile Device&rsquo;s precise location information via the Mobile App&rsquo;s location settings on your Mobile Device.</p>

<p><b><span class="blue">Use of PII</span></b><br /> We use the information we collect to provide the Services to you, to enhance your experience with the Services, and to improve the Services and our business. In addition to other purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we use PII, for example:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>to provide, localize and bill for Services requested by Customers;</li>
<li>to respond to questions from Customers;</li>
<li>to market products and Services that we believe may be of interest to Customers, including by telephone, email, postal mail and SMS/text message;</li>
<li>to enable our vendors, contractors and partners to provide and assist us in the provision and marketing of Services to Customers and to participate in joint marketing efforts;</li>
<li>to engage in research and development and to evolve and create new product and service offerings;</li>
<li>to monitor quality control, integrity, and security of the Services, to investigate potential misuse of the Services or violations of our Terms of Service, and to protect our rights and property; and</li>
<li>for other purposes disclosed when information is submitted to us or described in agreements we may have with you.</li>
</ul>
<p>To perform the above functions and others described in this Privacy Policy, we may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, including PII and Usage Information, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources (including third parties) such as contact information, demographic information, personal interest information, and information provided to us by governmental agencies and regulators. We or our service providers may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, our Services, our emails and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate.</p>
<p>Vonage will not read, listen to or disclose to any third parties the content of your private email, conversations, or other communications that are transmitted using our Services without your prior consent except, on an as needed basis, for quality control, customer support, and voicemail transcription services, or as otherwise authorized or required by law.</p>
<a name="section_4_2"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Your Consent to Communications</span></b><br /> By providing your contact information to us, you consent to receive email messages, text messages, phone calls, faxes and postal mail, including that of a promotional nature, from Vonage and our affiliates at the contact information you provide. You consent to receive phone calls from Vonage and its affiliates even if your phone number is listed on the federal or state &ldquo;do not call&rdquo; registries. <b>An auto-dialer and/or artificial or prerecorded message may be used to make calls to you.</b> You agree to enter into, sign and receive this consent to receive communications electronically. You represent that you are legally competent and have legal authority to form a contract and provide this consent with respect to the contact information you provide. You must be 18 years of age or older. You may not consent on behalf of someone else or provide someone else&rsquo;s contact information. You are not required to agree to promotional communications in order to purchase goods or services from us.</p>
<p>Text messages may be informational, or about our promotional offerings. Informational text messages may include, for example, registration verifications, texts containing a Mobile App download link after you have requested our Mobile App, texts to set up certain Service features you have selected, account balance information or notifications of price or Service changes, and texts informing you of voice messages received in your account. Your wireless carrier may charge fees for text messages, emails and calls to your Mobile Device. Msg&amp;Data Rates May Apply. Text &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; to opt out of text our messages. Text &ldquo;Help&rdquo; for Help.</p>
<a name="section_4_3"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Your Choices</span></b><br /> If you do not want your PII or CPNI used by Vonage for any direct marketing purposes, or shared with third parties for their own marketing use, then you may opt out of such use or sharing by contacting us as described in the <a href="#section_6_10">Questions and Contact Information Section</a> below, even if you have previously consented to such use. &nbsp;You may also control whether our Mobile Apps can access certain content on your Mobile Device via the settings on your Mobile Device. We may offer additional choices at the time Customers sign up for Services or within marketing communications, such as email opt-outs.</p>
<p>However, we are not responsible for removing your PII from the records of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this or a prior Privacy Policy. In addition, because we must use a Customer&rsquo;s PII in order to provide our services, Customers cannot opt out of all uses of their PII unless they cancel their Service.</p>
<a name="section_4_4"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Aggregate De-Identified Information</span></b><br /> We aggregate our customer information together in a way that does not reveal our customers&rsquo; names, contact information or personal identities. Once we do this, we may use and disclose such aggregate and de-identified information in any way and for any purpose allowed under applicable law without your consent.</p>
<a name="section5"></a>
<h4>Why and with whom do we share information?</h4>
<p>We may share PII with affiliates, vendors and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose or make available any Consumer PII to any third parties seeking to market third party products without your consent. We only work with carefully selected vendors, and we require any vendors with whom we share PII to protect the confidentiality of such information and use it solely for the purposes for which it was shared.</p>
<p>If you purchase certain products and Services offered by Vonage or a partner through a special marketing arrangement (for example, through a co-branded advertisement or offer, or an arrangement where we and a partner market or offer the other&rsquo;s products or services), PII may be received and shared by both Vonage and our partner. Each company&rsquo;s own privacy policy applies.</p>
<p>We will not share your credit card or other financial account information with any third parties, even joint marketing partners, unless they are involved in processing payments for Services that you have purchased from Vonage.</p>
<p>We may disclose your <a href="#section_2_4">precise geographic location information</a>, subject to applicable law, for example, to emergency service providers, law enforcement, family members in the event of an emergency, and otherwise with your express prior authorization.</p>
<p>The name on your account, or a portion thereof, and/or your phone number may be displayed to people that you make calls to and to other users of the Services so that they may contact you.</p>
<p>If you are a business customer, and have requested this, your business name and phone number may be included in public directories.</p>
<p>We may also use and disclose PII, subject to applicable law, to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activities that threaten the integrity of our Service, network, or business; to investigate fraud or violations of our <a href="/tos">Terms of Service</a>; as required by courts or administrative agencies; in response to a subpoena, court order, or lawful law enforcement request, or in connection with a sale, merger, liquidation, or reorganization of our business or assets.</p>
<p>We may disclose your PII to credit bureaus, such as to report late payments and other defaults on your account. With regard to CPNI, this is subject to the CPNI Section above.</p>
<p>Your calls and messages made through our Service may be transmitted through your own Internet access provider. Naturally, if so, your Internet access provider handles your communications as they flow through their lines. We have no responsibility for what your Internet access provider does or does not do with your information.</p>

<h4>Other Important Information About Your Privacy</h4>
<a name="section_6_1"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Interest Based Advertising</span></b><br /> We work with third party ad networks that serve advertisements displayed to you on our Services and elsewhere. These companies may use information about your online activities over time and across our Services and other online properties, the region of the country or world where your IP address indicates you are located, as well as other information about you, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These companies may employ cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to collect information about your online activities to personalize advertising content to you and to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. The information practices of these ads networks are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. For more information about third-party advertisers and how to prevent them from using your information, visit Aboutads.info at <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>. You have to opt out using each of your Web browsing applications, computers and Mobile Devices separately.</p>
<a name="section_6_2"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Information Security</span></b><br /> Vonage has implemented administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to help protect the PII that we transmit and maintain. However, no system or service can give a 100% guarantee of security, especially a service that relies upon the public Internet. Therefore, you acknowledge the risk that third parties may gain unauthorized access to your information.</p>
<p>Keep your account password secret. You are responsible for any activity under your account using your account password or other credentials.</p>
<p>If we believe that the security of your PII in our care may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we will endeavor to notify you as promptly as possible under the circumstances, subject to any legal obligations to notify law enforcement and regulators first. If we have your email address, we may notify you by email, subject to applicable law. You consent to our use of email as a means of such notification.</p>
<a name="section_6_3"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Public Forums</span></b><br /> You should be aware that any PII which you voluntarily include and transmit through publicly accessible forums (such as chat rooms, blogs, social networking sites, or listservs) may be viewed and used by anyone with access to such forums. Vonage is unable to control such uses of your PII, and by using such Services, you assume the risk that the PII provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties.</p>
<a name="section_6_4"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Account Information and Access</span></b><br /> Consistent with applicable laws and data security requirements, Vonage will reasonably honor written requests from Consumers to access or amend their account information, such as name, address, and billing information. Customers are responsible for ensuring that the information on file with Vonage is current and accurate. Customers may access and update their information by <a href="http://www.vonage.com/?login">logging in to their account</a> or contacting us as described in the <a href="#section_6_10">Questions and Contact Information Section</a> below. Where permitted by law, Vonage may charge a reasonable fee to process requests for access to data and may limit the number of requests per year. Your right to amend your information is subject to our records retention policies.</p>
<a name="section_6_5"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Children's Privacy Policy</span></b><br /> Vonage does not sell products or services for purchase by children. Vonage does not knowingly solicit or collect PII from children or teenagers under the age of eighteen. If you believe that a minor has disclosed PII to Vonage, please <a href="#section_6_10">report this to us</a>.</p>
<a name="section_6_6"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Third Party Web Sites and Services</span></b><br /> Our Services may contain links to other Web sites and services not maintained by Vonage or its affiliates. In addition, other Web sites and services may also reference or link to our Service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our Service or browse the Internet, and to read the privacy statements of the third party Web sites and services that you visit. We do not endorse, screen, or approve, and are not responsible for the privacy practices, or the content of, such other Web sites and services.</p>
<p>Vonage does not assume, and expressly disclaims, any liability for third parties that have been provided with information as permitted by this Privacy Policy or who have collected information as permitted by this Privacy Policy (such as advertisers using third party cookies).</p>
<a name="section_6_7"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Changes to this Policy</span></b><br /> We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this Privacy Policy at any time by posting such changes here. You should review this Privacy Policy regularly for changes, and can easily see if changes have been made by checking the Effective Date below. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use PII collected under this Privacy Policy in a way that differs materially and adversely from this Privacy Policy, we will post such changes here and we may request your consent or approval before implementing the change with respect to PII that you provided to us before the change in policy.</p>
<a name="section_6_8"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Transfer of Your Information to the United States of America and Other Countries</span></b><br /> Our Services are primarily maintained in the United States of America, where PII is stored and processed to provide our Services and for our operations. Vonage also has limited-purpose offices in the United Kingdom. We and/or our service providers also process data in some other countries for customer care, account management and service provisioning. When you sign up for Service with Vonage or inquire about our Services, we transfer your information to the United States and other countries as necessary to perform our agreement with you or to respond to an inquiry you make. Accordingly, by using our Services, you authorize the transfer of your PII to the United States, where we are based, and to other locations where we and/or our service providers operate, and to its (and their) storage and use as specified in this Privacy Policy and any applicable Terms of Service or other agreement between you and Vonage. In some cases, Vonage may seek specific consent for the use or transfer of your information overseas at the time of collection. If you do not consent, we may be unable to provide you with the Services you requested. The United States and other countries where we operate may not have protections for PII equivalent to those in your home country.</p>
<a name="section_6_9"></a>
<p><b><span class="blue">Your California Privacy Rights</span></b><br /> California's "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California Consumers asking about the businesses' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy, as we do, only to disclose personal information of Consumers to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes if the Consumer has opted into such information-sharing.</p>
