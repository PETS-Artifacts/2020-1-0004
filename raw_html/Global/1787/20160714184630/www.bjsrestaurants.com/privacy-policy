We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites, except for persistent identifiers that may be collected through children&rsquo;s sections of our Sites which (as permitted by applicable law) we will use solely to support the internal operations of the Sites. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, then you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this Privacy Policy below and request that we delete that information from our systems.</p>

<p><strong>Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>

<p>Please note that we may share information collected about you with our affiliates and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information with respect to the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties, within the immediately preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at <a href="mailto:CaliforniaPrivacyRights@bjsrestaurants.com" rel="nofollow">CaliforniaPrivacyRights@bjsrestaurants.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Links to Third-Party Sites</strong></p>

<p>There may be links on our Sites that will take you to third-party sites. Please be aware that we do not control any such third-party sites, and we are not responsible for the contents of any third-party site or any link contained in such a site. The inclusion of any link on one of our Sites does not imply endorsement of the third-party site. The use and privacy practices of the operator of any third-party site as to any information you provide is in no way subject to this Privacy Policy. Each third-party site may have its own policy that could differ considerably from our Privacy Policy, or the third-party site may not display any privacy policy at all.</p>

<p>We use reasonable technical, administrative and physical measures to protect information contained in our systems against misuse, loss or alteration.

<p>You can choose not to receive promotional emails from us by &ldquo;unsubscribing&rdquo; using the instructions in any email you receive from us. This will not stop us from sending emails about your account or your transactions with us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have agreed to let us send you text messages, you can withdraw your consent at any time by sending a text to us with the word &ldquo;STOP&rdquo;, in response to any text message we send you. We may send you one immediate confirmation text acknowledging receipt of your message.</p>
