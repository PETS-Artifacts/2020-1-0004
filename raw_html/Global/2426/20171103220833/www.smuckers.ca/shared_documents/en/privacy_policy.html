    <h2>Other Information Collected Automatically</h2>
    <p>In some cases, we may collect information automatically that is not generally personally-identifiable.

    <p>However, we also collect and use your Internet protocol (IP) address, which is a set of numbers that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you log on to your internet service provider or through your company's local area network (LAN) or wide area network (WAN). When you view a web page, the web server automatically identifies your computer by the IP address assigned to it during your session online. We may store and use the IP address and other automatically collected information for the purposes of administering our Site and auditing the use of our Site.

    <p>If you register on the Site, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, it allows us to tailor the Site to better match your interests and preferences and provide you with the requested product or service, and respond to your request for information in your registration form. If Cookies are disabled in your browser you will be unable to access those areas of the Site to which registration is required (e.g., the Smucker's Community).</p>
    <p>You may choose not to use Cookies at any time after you have registered by selecting the "NO" option in question 2 of "Edit My Profile."
