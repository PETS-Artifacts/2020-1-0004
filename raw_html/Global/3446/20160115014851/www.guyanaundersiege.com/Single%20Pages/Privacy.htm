        Jan. 3 — A novice crime writer who has been jailed for more than five

        Vanessa Leggett, 33, is to be freed from a federal detention center in 
        Houston because the grand jury that had demanded all her research for 
        a book on a killing has ended its investigation of the victim's husband,

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Leggett 
        was jailed on contempt charges on July 20 after refusing to hand over 
        her research. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal prosecutors 
        contend that she is not a journalist and therefore does not fall under 
        the First Amendment's protection of the press. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Ms. Leggett 
        has never published a book or news article; her previous writings have 
        appeared in academic journals. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In an effort 
        to protect herself from being jailed again over her research, Ms. Leggett 
        will continue her appeal of an appellate court decision that upheld her 
        incarceration, Mr. DeGeurin said.</font></p>

      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. 
        District Court Judge Nicholas H. Politan has granted the government's 
        motion to keep secret--for now--the technical details of a computer keystroke 
        logging tool. The judge will privately review a detailed description of 
        the device, without revealing it to the defense. He will consider the 
        government's claim that national security would be at risk if the method's 
        details become public. If Politan decides the government's national security 
        claim is valid, then the defense--and the public--will see only a limited 
        description of the key logger system's inner workings. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FBI 
        agents acting with a warrant surreptitiously broke into the office of 
        Nicodemo S. Scarfo Jr.'s in May 1999 to plant a keystroke logging device 
        on his PC. In an earlier raid on the office, FBI computer experts found 
        one encrypted file they could not break. The keystroke logger enabled 
        agents to record the file's password as Scarfo typed. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;There's 
        a lot about the technology used by the FBI that could be publicly discussed, 
        and deserves to be publicly discussed,&quot; says James Dempsey, deputy 
        director for the Center for Democracy and Technology, an advocacy group. 
        &quot;This is a hugely important case, because the government says if 
        it can't get what it wants by other means, it will break into your house 
        and plant a device that records everything you type until it gets what 
        it wants.&quot;</font></p>

      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        U.S. Department of Justice, working with the FBI, charged Scarfo with 
        racketeering, illegal gambling, and loan sharking as a member of what 
        they call a Mafia crime family. Scarfo's father is jailed mob boss Nicodemo 
        S. &quot;Little Nicky&quot; Scarfo Sr. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        warrant specifically required that the key logger device not be used to 
        monitor Scarfo's Internet traffic, because tracking a user's surfing requires 
        a warrant equivalent to one for a wiretap. The defense has argued that 
        it cannot determine if the technology violates the warrant, because the 
        government won't reveal information about the program. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prosecutors 
        contend that if details of the key logger system are made public, it will 
        be useless in further investigations and will jeopardize current ones.

        Scarfo case raises new issues for privacy, but not all have to do with 
        emerging technology, Dempsey says. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;The 
        troubling thing is the lack of notice,&quot; he says. &quot;Here, they 
        had a Fourth Amendment warrant ... but they didn't issue notice for the 
        search. In the Scarfo case, and a growing number of cases, the government 
        is claiming it can dispense with the notice requirement and can come into 
        your house secretly, plant things, take pictures, copy things, and leave 
        without telling you. That is a huge attack on the Fourth Amendment.&quot; 
        </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        key logger system illustrates the increasing role of technology in government 
        surveillance, and the increasing gap between the pace of the law and the 
        advance of science. Another prominent electronic-surveillance issue involves 
        Carnivore, now renamed the more public relations-friendly DCS1000 surveillance 
        system. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carnivore 
        allows law enforcement agents to intercept e-mail, ostensibly sifting 
        through public electronic transmissions to get to the target's correspondence. 
        The system raises privacy concerns because it isn't clear if Carnivore 
        prevents agents from capturing e-mail beyond the target of a warrant.

        federal judge in New Jersey has rejected a defense motion to suppress 
        computer evidence gained in an FBI case against an accused Mafia loan 
        shark, possibly clearing a path for the government to use secretly installed 
        keystroke logging tools to defeat encryption. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">FBI 
        agents acting with a warrant in May 1999 installed a keystroke logging 
        device on the computer of Nicodemo S. Scarfo Jr., hoping to record a password 
        for a file encrypted with PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) software. Scarfo's 
        attorneys hoped to suppress the evidence as unconstitutional, a violation 
        of the U.S. Constitution's Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable 
        search and seizure. The defense also objected to the government's effort 
        to keep the workings of the keystroke logger secret. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Federal 
        prosecutors call Scarfo a mobster--Scarfo's father is jailed mob boss 
        Nicodemo S. &quot;Little Nicky&quot; Scarfo Sr. The DOJ charged the younger 
        Scarfo with racketeering, illegal gambling, and loan sharking. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Prosecutors 
        invoked the Classified Information Protection Act in August of 2000, asserting 
        that the technical details of the computer keystroke logging tool must 
        remain a secret in the interest of national security, a move more typically 
        associated with protecting military or espionage secrets like those involved 
        in the Wen Ho Lee nuclear secrets case or the spy case of Robert Hanssen,

      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        warrant permitting the keystroke logger to be installed specifically prohibited 
        the government from monitoring Scarfo's Internet communication. Scarfo's 
        attorneys claimed that by keeping details of the logger's mechanisms secret, 
        the defense could not determine if the warrant had been breached. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">&quot;We 
        didn't capture any kind of electronic communications,&quot; said Ronald 
        Wigler, an assistant U.S. attorney for the New Jersey district. While 
        the judge received a classified briefing on the workings of the keystroke 
        logger, he concluded based on unclassified parts of the briefing that 
        no communication interception occurred, Wigler said. </font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">U.S. 
        District Court Judge Nicholas H. Politan rejected defense arguments in 
        his ruling, indicating that the summary description of the keystroke logger 
        made public in court meets the defendant's need to know what facts or 
        documents the prosecutors are likely to use at trial to make their case.

      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        legislation is known as the Patriot (Provide Appropriate Tools Required 
        to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism) Act. It expands the government's 
        ability to monitor communications, including e-mail and cell phone conversations, 
        and share that information among agencies. Its aim is to &quot;provide 
        law enforcement agencies with the appropriate tools to prevent&quot; terrorism 
        like that which occurred on September 11, with the attack on the Pentagon 
        and World Trade Center, according to F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr. (R-Wisconsin), 
        chair of the House Judiciary committee.</font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now,

        addition, the U.S. attorney general is required to report semiannually 
        to Congress on its use of the so-called Carnivore e-mail and Internet 
        surveillance system, renamed DCS 1000</font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The 
        law requires agencies keep a record of who installed e-mail taps, when 
        and for how long, how Carnivore was configured, and what was recorded.</font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Carnivore 
        can be used only after a judge signs a pen register, and the records must 
        be given under seal to a judge 30 days after the court order for e-mail 
        filtering expires.</font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">For 
        agents to tap without a warrant, an ISP must own its network, law enforcement 
        must be involved in a lawful investigation, and only the suspect's communications 
        can be intercepted. While the police must have &quot;reasonable grounds 
        to believe that the contents of the computer trespasser's communications 
        will be relevant to the investigation,&quot; the law is not specific to 
        hacker terrorists and can be applied to any computer crime investigation.</font></p>
      <p class=black13lh15><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">ISPs

        advocates have reacted strongly to the antiterrorism bills, arguing that 
        civil liberties are at stake. The Electronic Privacy Information Center 
        has urged lawmakers not to limit civil liberties in its attempt to investigate 
        terrorists. EPIC has focused specifically on computer and communication
