        <h5>Indianapolis Motor Speedway, LLC Privacy Policy &ndash; Effective &amp; Last Modified September 9, 2016</h5>
<!--<p align="center"><strong>PRIVACY POLICY</strong><br>
  <em>(Effective &amp; Last  Modified September 9, 2016)</em></p>-->
<p>This website is a service  of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, LLC together with its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, vendors,  and licensees (collectively, &ldquo;IMS,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; &ldquo;we,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). We have adopted  this privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) to explain what information may be  collected when you access the website <a href="http://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com">www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com</a> or any other website we place this Privacy  Policy on (&ldquo;Website&rdquo;), use any of our mobile or other applications  (&ldquo;Applications&rdquo;), or access or use any of our social media pages, how we and  others use this information, under what circumstances we may disclose the  information to third parties, and the instances in which we may allow third  parties to collect information directly.&nbsp;  Depending on your activities when using or accessing our Website,  Applications, or social media pages (collectively, &ldquo;Services&rdquo;), you may from  time-to-time be required to agree to additional terms and conditions. Without  limiting the foregoing, our Services include any promotion, contest, or  sweepstakes which refers to this Privacy Policy with respect to the collection  and use of your information.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies regardless of  whether you use our Services via a computer, mobile device, or other platform or  equipment (collectively, your &ldquo;Equipment&rdquo;).&nbsp;  This Privacy Policy also applies only to information we collect through  our Services, including, without limitation, our Website, Applications, and  social media pages, and does not apply to our collection of information from  other sources. </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Modifications to this Privacy Policy</em></strong></p>
<p>We generally keep this Privacy Policy posted on  our Website and accessible in our Applications.&nbsp;  You should review this Privacy Policy frequently, as it may change from  time to time without notice. Any changes will be effective immediately upon the  posting of the revised Privacy Policy.&nbsp;  WHEN YOU USE OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY.&nbsp; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY, OR  TO ANY CHANGES WE MAY SUBSEQUENTLY MAKE, IMMEDIATELY STOP USING OUR SERVICES.&nbsp; Please note, however, that if we decide to  use your personally identifiable information in a manner materially different  than what is provided in this Privacy Policy or what we advised at the time it  was collected, we will notify you of this change by email to the last email  address provided to us or through our Applications. &nbsp;You will have a choice (by means of an &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo;  opportunity) as to whether or not we use your information in this different  manner.&nbsp; In such case, we will use your  personally identifiable information in accordance with the terms in place when  the information was collected. </p>
<p>
<strong>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; INFORMATION WE COLLECT<br />
</strong><br />
We  typically collect two kinds of information about you when you use our Services:  (a) information that you provide that personally identifies you; and (b)  information that does not personally identify you, but that we automatically  collect when you use our Services or that you provide us. </p>
<p><strong>(1)&nbsp; Personally Identifiable Information:&nbsp; </strong>Our  definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that  may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name,  address, or phone number. As a general policy, we do not automatically  collect your personally identifiable information when you visit our Website. In certain  circumstances, we may request, allow, or otherwise provide you an opportunity  to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a  feature, program, promotion, or some other aspect of our Services. &nbsp;For instance, you  may: (a) provide your name, mail/shipping address, email address, credit card  number, and phone number when registering with our Services, including the use  of our online store, or in connection with a contest entry; (b) provide certain  demographic information about yourself (e.g., age, gender, purchase preference,  usage frequency) when using our Services, participating in a survey or poll, or  joining a club; or (c) post a general comment and/or recommendation on our Services. Certain  information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your  age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age  and name). Whether  or not you provide this information is your choice; in many instances, however,  this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity,  realize a benefit we may offer, or gain access to certain content or features  available through our Services.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>(2) &nbsp;Non-Personal Information:</strong>&nbsp;Our definition of  non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify  you.&nbsp;Non-personal  information can include certain personally identifiable information that has  been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We obtain  non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either  separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically  collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Services  with your Equipment.&nbsp;This information can include, among other  things, your mobile device, other applications or software that you are using, your  wireless carrier, your IP addresses, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet  Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Opera), the websites you were on previously, the  third party website from which your visit originated, the operating system you  are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, Android, iPhone) on your Equipment,  the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., CenturyLink, Google, Cox,  AOL), the search terms you use on our Services, the specific web pages you  visit, how much you use our Services, and the duration of your visits. </p>
<p><strong>(3) &nbsp;Location Information:</strong> When  you use our Services, particularly our Application(s), we may automatically  collect certain Equipment (mobile device) specific information.&nbsp; This includes the general or specific  location of your Equipment through GPS, Bluetooth, or WiFi signals.&nbsp; Before we collect or send location-specific  information, it is our practice to ask for your consent.&nbsp; In some instances, your operating system may  not allow you to install an Application without giving us consent. In all  instances, you may withdraw your consent by disabling location features for  your Equipment &ndash; the Application will still work although certain location  features may not function.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW WE USE &amp;  SHARE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED </strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) &nbsp;Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> The personally identifiable information you submit to us is  generally used to carry out your requests, respond to your inquiries, better  serve you, or in other ways naturally associated with the circumstances in  which you provided the information. We may also use this information to later  contact you for a variety of reasons, such as customer service, providing you  promotional information for our products or those of our parent company,  subsidiaries, or other affiliated companies (&ldquo;affiliated companies),  or to communicate with you about content or other information you have posted  or shared with us via use of our Services. You may opt-out from receiving  future promotional information from us or our affiliated companies, or direct  that we not share your information with any affiliated companies, as set forth  below.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In  certain instances we may also share your personally identifiable information  with third parties performing functions on our behalf (or on behalf of our  affiliated companies) or accessing the Services (e.g., vendors that process  credit card orders, deliver our merchandise, administer our promotions, provide  us marketing or promotional assistance, analyze our data, assist us with  customer service). These third parties agree to use this information  and we share information with them only to carry out our requests or provide  Services. In  addition, we may share your personally identifiable information with  participating sponsors to a program or promotion (e.g., a sweepstakes or  contest) you enter via our Services, and with third parties who assist us in  using the content or other information you have posted or shared with us via  our Services (e.g., production companies we may use). Further, we may share your personally  identifiable information with third parties such as our co-promotional partners  and others with whom we have marketing or other relationships.&nbsp;Except as provided  in this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or as set forth when you submit the  information, your personally identifiable information will not be shared or  sold to any third parties without your prior approval.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>(2)&nbsp; Non-Personally Identifiable Information:</strong> We use non-personally identifiable information in a variety  of ways.&nbsp; For example, we may use  non-personally identifiable information to evaluate use of our Services (e.g.,  visits to our Website, use of our Applications), analyze site traffic, track  purchases, gauge coupon redemption rates, understand customer needs and trends,  carry out targeted promotional activities, and to improve our Services. &nbsp;We may use your non-personally identifiable  information by itself or aggregate it with information we have obtained from  others. &nbsp;We may, among other things, share  your non-personally identifiable information with our affiliated companies,  allow third parties to collect such information directly from you, and/or sell  the non-personally identifiable information to third parties to achieve these and  any other business objectives (e.g., generate revenue, form alliances).&nbsp; It is, however, important to remember that your  non-personally identifiable information is anonymous information that does not  personally identify you. </p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COOKIES AND  PREFERENCE BASED ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p><strong>(1) &nbsp;</strong><strong>Cookies and  Web Beacons:</strong>We  automatically receive and store certain types of non-personally identifiable  information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we  use "cookies" and "web beacons" (also called &ldquo;clear gifs&rdquo;  or &ldquo;pixel tags&rdquo;) and embedded scripts to obtain certain types of information  when you use or access our Services.&nbsp; Cookies are small files that we  transfer to your computer's hard drive or your web browser memory to enable our  systems to recognize your browser and to provide convenience and other features  to you. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in  function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of users,  when an email has been opened, and to provide other information.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Examples of the information we collect and analyze  in this manner include: the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your  Equipment to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser  type and version, operating system, and platform; your activities on our  Website, including the products you view or searched for, as well as the URL  you come from and go to next (whether this URL is on our Website or not); and cookie  number. <strong>It is important to note that the  cookies and Web beacons that we use do not contain and are not tied to  personally identifiable information about you. </strong><br />
<br />
If you are concerned about the storage and use of  cookies, you may block or limit the storage of cookies via browser controls or  other software (we do not make any promise that our Services will recognize or  be able to work with any such browser controls/software &ndash; see below for Do Not  Track options).&nbsp; You may also be able to  delete cookies manually from your Equipment through your internet browser,  operating system, or other programs. &nbsp;Please  note, however, that some portions of our Services will not function properly or  be available if you are able and do block and/or delete cookies. </p>
<p><strong>(2)&nbsp; <strong>Preference Based Advertising: </strong></strong>We may work with third parties,  including advertising companies and website analysis firms, who use cookies and  web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you use our  Services, including without limitation our Website and third party sites. &nbsp;This non-personally identifiable information,  collected through cookies and web beacons, is typically used by these third  party advertising companies (i.e., advertising networks) to serve you with advertisements  while on third party sites tailored to meet your preferences and needs.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not wish to participate in this  activity, go to <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a> and follow the simple opt-out  process. </p>
<p>A couple of important notes about  this opt-out tool: (1) it includes all the advertising networks that we may  work with, but also many that we do not work with; and (2) it may rely on  cookies to ensure that a given advertising network does not collect information  about you (&ldquo;Opt-out Cookies&rdquo;) &ndash; an explanation of how Opt-out Cookies work can  be found on <a href="http://www.aboutads.info">www.aboutads.info</a>.&nbsp;  Therefore, if you use different Equipment, change web  browsers, or delete these Opt-out Cookies from your computer, you will need to  perform the opt-out task again.</p>
<p><strong>(3)  Do Not Track Features: </strong>Certain  browsers may offer you the option of providing notice to websites that you do  not wish for your online activities to be tracked for preference based  advertising purposes (&ldquo;DNT Notice&rdquo;). Some browsers are, by default, set to  provide a DNT Notice, whether or not that reflects your preference. Providing  DNT Notice is often touted as a means to ensure that cookies, web beacons, and  similar technology are not used for preference based advertising purposes &ndash;  that is, to restrict the collection of non-personally identifiable information  about your online activities for advertising purposes. Unfortunately, given how  preference based advertising works, DNT Notices may not effectively accomplish  this goal. For this and a variety of other reasons, with respect to our  Website, we do not take any action based on browser based DNT Notices. Rather,  if you do not wish to participate in preference based advertising activities,  you should follow the simple opt-out process identified above.<strong>&nbsp; </strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OTHER USES &amp; INFORMATION </strong></p>
<p><strong>(1)&nbsp; IP Addresses:</strong> An  IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your Equipment  whenever you access the Internet. Web servers (computers that serve up web pages) automatically identify your Equipment by its IP address. When  visitors request pages from our Website, our servers typically log their IP  addresses. We collect IP addresses for purposes of system administration, to  report non-personal aggregate information to others, and to track the use of  our Services. IP  addresses are considered non-personally identifiable information and may also  be shared as provided above. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to  anything personally identifiable; that is, the visitors session will be logged, but the visitor remains anonymous  to us. We reserve the right, however, to use IP addresses to identify a visitor:  (a) at the request of the visitor; (b) when we feel it is necessary to enforce  compliance with our Service rules; (c) to fulfill a government request; (d) to conform  with the requirements of the law or legal process; (e) to protect or defend our  legal rights or property, our Services, or other users; or (f) in an emergency  to protect the health and safety of our customers, fans, or the general public. </p>
<p><strong>(2)&nbsp;</strong> <strong>Social Networks: </strong>We may offer you the ability to create or login to  your account with us through accounts you may have with various social network  platforms, such as Facebook or Twitter (each a &ldquo;Social Network Account&rdquo;). &nbsp;To do so, you may be required to provide, or  allow our Services to access, your Social Network Account login  information.&nbsp; By granting us access to  your Social Network Account, you understand and agree that we may access, make  available, and store any content that you have provided to and stored in your  Social Network Account (e.g., friends, mutual friends, contacts). &nbsp;We may make this information available on or  through our Services and to our users.&nbsp;  You may be able to restrict what information is shared and how it is  used through privacy and other settings.&nbsp;  Also, depending on the privacy settings you have set in your Social  Network Account, personally identifiable information may be shared with us and  made available through our Services and to our users.</p>
<p><strong>(3) &nbsp;Email  Communications:&nbsp; </strong>If you  send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personally  identifiable information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may  save your questions or comments for future reference.&nbsp; For security reasons, we do not recommend  that you send non-public personal information, such as passwords, social  security numbers, or bank account information, to us by email.&nbsp; We may send you emails for a variety of  reasons &ndash;such as emails in response to your request for a particular service or  your registration for a feature that involves email communications, that relate  to purchases you have made with us (e.g., product updates, customer support),  about our other products, services, or events, or when you consent to being  contacted by email for a particular purpose. &nbsp;In certain instances, we may provide you with  the option to set your preferences for receiving email communications from us &ndash;  that is, agree to some communications but not others. You may &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; of  receiving future commercial emails from us by clicking the &ldquo;unsubscribe,&rdquo; &ldquo;opt-out,&rdquo;  or similar link included at the bottom of most emails we send, or as provided  below; we reserve the right, however, to send you transactional emails such as  customer service communications.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>(4) &nbsp;Transfer of  Assets:</strong>&nbsp; As we continue to  develop our business, we may sell or purchase assets. &nbsp;If another entity acquires us or all (or  substantially all) of our assets, the personally identifiable information and  non-personal information we have about you will be transferred to and used by  this acquiring entity, though we will take reasonable steps to ensure that your  preferences are followed. &nbsp;Also, if any  bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such  information may be considered an asset of ours and as such may be sold or  transferred to third parties. </p>
<p><strong>(5) &nbsp;Other:</strong> Regardless  of any other provision in this Privacy Policy, we reserve the right to disclose  any personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information about  you if we are required to do so by law, with respect to copyright and other  intellectual property infringement claims, or if we believe that such action is  necessary to: (a) fulfill a government request; (b) conform with the  requirements of the law or legal process; (c) protect or defend our legal rights  or property of our Services, or other users; or (d) in an emergency to protect  the health and safety of our customers or the general public. </p>
<p><strong>(6) &nbsp;Your  California Privacy Rights:&nbsp; </strong>Under certain  provisions of the California Civil Code &sect;  1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from  companies conducting business in California a list of all third parties to  which the company has disclosed certain personally identifiable information as  defined under California law during the preceding year for third party direct  marketing purposes. You are limited to one request per calendar year. In your  request, please attest to the fact that you are a California resident and  provide a current California address for our response. You may request the  information in writing as provided in Section I below.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<strong>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PUBLIC  FORUMS </strong></p>
<p>We may offer chat rooms,  blogs, message boards, or similar public forums where you and other users of  our Services can share information and communicate &ndash; e.g., places where you can  post your resume and/or profile. The protections described in this Privacy  Policy do not apply when you provide information (including personal  information) in connection with your use of these public forums. &nbsp;We may use personally identifiable and  non-personal information about you to identify you with a posting in a public  forum. &nbsp;Any information you share in a  public forum is public information and may be seen or collected by anyone,  including third parties that do not adhere to our Privacy Policy. &nbsp;We are not responsible for events arising from  the distribution of any information you choose to publicly post or share  through our Services.</p>
<p><strong>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHILDREN </strong></p>
<p>The features, programs, promotions, and other  aspects of our Services requiring the submission of personally identifiable  information are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personally  identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Certain benefits of our Services may be restricted  to adults, age 18 or older.&nbsp; If you are a  parent or guardian of a child under the age of 13 and believe he or she has  disclosed personally identifiable information to us please contact us as  provided in Section I below.&nbsp; A parent or  guardian of a child under the age of 13 may review and request deletion of such  child's personally identifiable information as well as prohibit the use  thereof. </p>
<p><strong>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KEEPING  YOUR INFORMATION SECURE </strong></p>
<p>We have implemented  security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the  loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised,  however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable  information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any  information you disclose or transmit to us online or through our Services, and  are not responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of  your personally identifiable information.
