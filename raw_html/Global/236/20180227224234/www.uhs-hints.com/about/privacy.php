<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you
visit our website and to monitor certain pages of our website for the
purpose of reporting website traffic, statistics, advertisement
clickthroughs, and/or other activity on our website. These companies
may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies to
compile anonymous statistics about our website visitors.  No
personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email
address, or telephone number) is collected by these technologies.</p>

<p>If you would like more information about this practice and to limit
the cookies placed by these companies, please see their sites

<div class="header-bar-post">

<p>We do not share any personally identifiable information about you
with any third party, except when we reasonably believe that we are
required to so by law, to report activities generally accepted as
abuse or misconduct (e.g., to report users sending us spam to their
internet service providers), or as noted in the section below.</p>

<blockquote>
<b><font color="#31506D">For those purchasing our products and services:</b></font>

<p>When you place an order with us, we will share certain information
about you with third parties as is absolutely necessary to complete
the processing of your order.  For example, we send credit card
numbers and addresses to the payment processor for authorization and
fraud screening.</p>

<p>We will respond to any valid request from law enforcement agencies
or bank representatives who are investigating any suspected fraud
related to your order.  We also may contact these parties ourselves
if we reasonably suspect that your order is fraudulent.</p>

<p>We will also provide the contact information for customers of the
UHS Reader for MacOS to the developer of that program, Illume
Software.  Illume Software will contact you only if you have also
indicated that you wish us to contact you and will not give your
contact information to anyone else.</p>

<p>You may choose to purchase our products through several third-party
companies.  We will identify when we use these resellers in our
ordering instructions.  We do not share any personally identifiable
information about you with our resellers, except as we reasonably
believe is necessary to assist them in the processing or refunding of
any order that you may place with them.</p>
