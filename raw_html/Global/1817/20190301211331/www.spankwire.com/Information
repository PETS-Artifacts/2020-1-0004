Mediation will take place in Tortola, British Virgin Islands. The language of the mediation will be English. Each party will participate actively and constructively in mediation proceedings once started and will attend at least one joint meeting between the mediator and the parties.

		<p class="box_over"><b>25.4	<i>Arbitration</i></b>. If the parties cannot settle a dispute through mediation, the parties will settle any unresolved dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms by arbitration under the British Virgin Islands Arbitration Act of 2013.

		<p><b>25.5	<i>Right to Injunctive Relief</i></b>.

		<p><b>25.6	<i>Recovery of Expenses</i></b>. In any adversarial proceedings between the parties arising out of this agreement or relating to the subject matter of this agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover from the other party, besides any other relief awarded, all expenses that the prevailing party incurs in those proceedings, including legal fees and expenses.

		<p><b>25.7	<i>Waiver of Jury Trial</i></b>. Both parties hereby waive the right to a trial by jury for any dispute arising out of (or relating to) the Website or these terms. Either party may enforce this waiver up to and including the first day of trial.</p><br/>

		<h2 class="headerTitle titleBold"><a name="rate"></a>How can I rate, share or download a video?</h2>
		<p>On the video player page, just below the player screen, you will see green and red thumb icons. This is where you can Rate a video. Give it a thumbs up if you like it, or a thumbs down if you don't. Further to the right you will see buttons marked "Share Video", "Download Video" and "Comments". (We will get to Downloading videos in a moment.) Click "Share Video" and a small menu will drop down, allowing you to share the clip on Twitter, Reddit, StumbleUpon, Delicious and many other networks with a click of a button! By clicking "Comments", the page will automatically scroll down to the Comments section, where you can add and read comments on the video.</p>

				<li>The video must be under 500 MB and uploaded in a supported file format</li>
				<li>The video should be tagged and titled with accurate terms</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
