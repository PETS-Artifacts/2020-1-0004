<p><b>7.&nbsp; Methods to Collect Information:</b></p>
<p>A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us in many ways to make your visit to our website more enjoyable and meaningful to you. For example, cookies avoid you having to log in every time you come back to one of our websites. They also allow us to tailor a website or advertisement to better match your interests and preferences.&nbsp; There are a couple different types of cookies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A “session” cookie is stored only in your computer’s working memory (RAM) and only lasts for your browsing session. When you close all your browser’s windows, or when you shut down your computer, the session cookie disappears forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Persistent cookies stay on your computer until either a) they expire, b) they are overwritten with newer cookies, or c) you manually remove them.&nbsp; Most browsers can be configured not to accept cookies, however, this may prevent you from having access to some site functions or features.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lincoln.com may use spotlight ads/web beacons/GIF/pixel tags which are site instrumentation tools that help us to determine, for instance, whether a page has been viewed or not and, if so, how many times. &nbsp;Emails or electronic newsletters we send may use tools (e.g., pixel tags or web beacons) to gather email metrics and information to improve the reader’s experience such as how many of the emails are opened, if they were printed or forwarded, the type of device (e.g., mobile or PC) from which they were opened, and the city, state, and county associated with the applicable IP address. &nbsp;In general, any electronic image viewed as part of a webpage, including an ad banner, can act as a web beacon. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This website may generate a “session log” when you visit our site.&nbsp; We use session logs to help us determine how people travel through our site. In this way, we can structure our pages so that the information most frequently visited is easier to find.
