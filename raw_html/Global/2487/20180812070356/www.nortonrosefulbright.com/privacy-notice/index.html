<h3>5. Who we share your personal data with</h3>
<p>Norton Rose Fulbright is a global law firm and as such any personal data that we collect or you provide to us may be shared with and processed by any Norton Rose Fulbright entity among our global network. Please <a href="http://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/about-us/global-coverage/">click here</a> for a full list of our entities and locations.</p>
<p>We may also share your personal data with a variety of the following categories of third parties:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our professional advisors (e.g. legal, financial, business, risk management or other advisors), bankers and auditors;</li>
<li>Our insurers and insurance brokers;</li>
<li>Third party service providers, including a service center based in the Philippines that is operated by Accenture UK Limited, to whom we outsource certain functions such as information and document management, office support, technology and IT services, word processing, photocopying and translation services (we have agreements in place with these service providers to protect the confidentiality and security of information (including personal data) shared with them);</li>
<li>Other third party external advisors or experts engaged in the course of the services we provide to our clients and with their prior consent, such as barristers, local counsel and technology service providers such as eDiscovery and document review platforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also process your personal data to comply with our regulatory requirements or in the course of dialogue with our regulators as applicable, which may include disclosing your personal data to government, regulatory or law enforcement agencies in connection with enquiries, proceedings or investigations by such parties anywhere in the world or where compelled to do so. Where permitted, or unless to do so would prejudice the prevention or detection of a crime, we will direct any such request to you or notify you before responding.<a id="6"></a></p>
<h3>6. Which countries we transfer your personal data to</h3>
<p>As a global law firm, we cannot limit our processing of an individual&rsquo;s personal data to the country in which that individual is based. In the course of providing our services, we will likely need to transfer personal data to locations outside the jurisdiction in which you provide it or where you are viewing our website. If you are based in the European Economic Area (EEA), this will mean that your personal data may be transferred to, accessible from, and/or stored at, a destination outside the EEA in which data protection laws may not be as comprehensive as in the EEA.</p>
<p>Regardless of the location of our processing, we will impose the same data protection safeguards that we deploy inside the EEA and implement appropriate measures to ensure that your personal data is protected in accordance with applicable data protection laws. Norton Rose Fulbright has a data sharing agreement in place signed by all Norton Rose Fulbright entities which includes EU standard contractual clauses. Similarly, where a third party service provider processes the personal data of EEA residents on our behalf, we will ensure that appropriate measures are in place to ensure an adequate level of protection for your personal data, usually by including EU standard contractual clauses in our agreements with such third party service providers.</p>
<p>Please contact us as directed below if you would like to see a copy of the specific safeguards applied to the export of your personal data.<a id="7"></a></p>
<h3>7. How long we keep your personal data</h3>
<p>We will retain your personal data for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which this data was collected and any other permitted linked purpose (for example certain transaction details and correspondence related to any legal services we provide may be retained until the time limit for claims in respect of the transaction has expired or in order to comply with regulatory requirements regarding the retention of such data). If your personal data is used for two purposes we will retain it until the purpose with the latest period expires; but we will stop using it for the purpose with a shorter period once that period expires. Our retention periods are also based on our business needs and good practice.<a id="8"></a></p>
<h3>8. How we protect your personal data</h3>
<p>We recognise that information security is an integral element of data privacy. While no data transmission (including over the Internet or any website) can be guaranteed to be secure from intrusion, we implement a range of commercially reasonable physical, technical and procedural measures to help protect personal data from unauthorised access, use, disclosure, alteration or destruction in accordance with data protection law requirements.</p>
<p>Information that you provide to us is stored on our or our service providers&rsquo; secure servers and accessed and used subject to our security policies and standards, or those agreed with our service providers. Norton Rose Fulbright LLP has held the ISO/IEC 27001:2013 (ISO 27001) accreditation for its UK IT operations since 2011 and we align our other IT operations globally to these standards. ISO27001 is an internationally recognised certification that information security is managed in line with best practice.</p>
<p>Everyone at Norton Rose Fulbright and any third party service providers we may engage that process personal data on our behalf (for the purposes listed above) are also contractually obligated to respect the confidentiality of personal data.</p>
<p>Alongside our role, please also note that where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our websites or online services, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential and for complying with any other security procedures that we notify you of. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.<a id="9"></a></p>

<li>restrict how we use your information whilst a complaint is being investigated.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it is our policy to respect the rights of individuals, please be aware that your exercise of these rights is subject to certain exemptions to safeguard the public interest (e.g. the prevention or detection of crime), our interests (e.g. the maintenance of legal privilege) and some of these rights may be limited (for example the right to withdraw consent) where we are required or permitted by law to continue processing your personal data to defend our legal rights or meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>
<p>If you contact us to exercise any of these rights we will check your entitlement and respond in most cases within a month.</p>
