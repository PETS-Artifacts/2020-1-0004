<p dir="ltr">In order to comply with recent GDPR compliance we also updated our Advertising policy. Please check our <a href="https://www.steadyhealth.com/polices/advertising">Advertising Policy</a> to learn more.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">User content</h3>

<p dir="ltr">We may collect and retain any posts, comments or other content you share through the Service ("User Content"). We treat this information as Personally Identifiable Information when it is combined and stored with Personally Identifiable Information. In all other cases, we treat it as Non-Personally Identifiable Information, even where the User Content itself may identify you.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Should you terminate or deactivate your account with the Service, we may retain and continue to use the information we have collected from you, including User Content, indefinitely.</p>

<p dir="ltr">User Content posted to the Service is available to the public and may be viewed and used by others. We are unable to control such uses of your User Content, and by using the Service you assume the risk that your User Content may be viewed and used by third parties.</p>

<p dir="ltr">If you do not want people to be able to see any Personally Identifiable Information, such as your username, through the Service, you can request the anonymization and removal of your account by going to your Profile page, clicking on Edit Profile, and selecting the <strong>close account, anonymize my content, or close account and anonymize my content button </strong>at the bottom of the edit profile page. Please note that while the removal and anonymization of your account will remove any Personally Identifiable Information from your content, anyone who visits a page where you left a post will still be able to see your posts in an anonymized form.</p>

<p dir="ltr">LifeForm reserves the right to monitor, moderate, and delete the User Content you post on the Service for any or no reason. This includes deleting material that violates or may violate the Service’s Terms of Service or the law, and removing content to protect or defend our rights or property or those of any third party. LifeForm also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Privacy in public</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Any information disclosed on the Service becomes public information. We advise you to keep in mind that all discussion board posts are subject to search engines with world-wide access to any reader. Do not post or offer your real name, email address, home address, telephone number, or any other contact information.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Publicly sharing email addresses with people you have met online, including in private messages, can attract spammers that are difficult to control, so we emphatically advise you against doing this. We also recommend that you do not designate your real name, your unique email address, or the name of a website, as a your username. Should you decide to post personally embarrassing or sensitive content, in order to seek help or share information, please consider the possibility your username or the personal details you provide in your content could still be attributed to you indirectly by your friends, family, or potential employers. The best practice is to choose a username that cannot be linked to you. Keep your username anonymous.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Information including, but not limited to, email addresses, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, names, websites or links, personal profile settings, signature, posts, surveys, polls, private messages, websites, and research studies will be removed without any prior notice, as defined in our Terms of Service.</p>

<p dir="ltr">All registered users may review, update or correct the Personally Identifiable Information provided in their registration or account profile by changing the "user preferences" in their account. You will find these options at the bottom of your profile page in edit mode:</p>

<ul dir="ltr">
	<li><strong>Close my account:</strong> If you close your account, your SteadyHealth profile will be deleted. Content you wrote will still be visible under your username.</li>
	<li><strong>Anonymize my content: </strong>If you anonymize your content, your username will be removed from all the content you created up to this point. You can continue to write content, but your username will be attached to any future content you create.</li>
	<li><strong>Close account and anonymize my content:</strong> If you close your account and anonymize your content, your SteadyHealth profile will be deleted. Any content that you submitted will no longer be published under your username.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">However, you understand and agree that we are not able to remove your Personally Identifiable Information from the records of any third party who has previously been provided with your information.</p>

<p dir="ltr">You will continue to see targeted ads (interest-based ads) from our advertising partners.

<p dir="ltr">You may opt out of receiving subscription emails from us at any time by using the opt-out mechanism contained in such emails (the "unsubscribe" feature). You may also unsubscribe or manage your email subscription in Notification settings in the edit section of your Profile. Please note that unsubscribing from LifeForm emails will unsubscribe your from notification emails and digest emails. You will still receive transactional emails necessary for the LifeForm Service to function. These include, but may not be limited to, emails confirming the creation of a new account, emails helping you reset your password, etc.</p>
