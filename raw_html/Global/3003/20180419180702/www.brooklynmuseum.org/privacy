<p><strong>1.&nbsp; INTRODUCTION; GENERAL TERMS</strong></p>

This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect and use in connection with your use of the Services and how and when we disclose such information. Please take a few minutes to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand how we treat your information. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use any of the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.2&nbsp; This Privacy Policy governs only the information collected by us on or through your use of the Services, and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other third party, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided any of your information to third parties, including, without limitation, marketing companies, advertisers and product/service providers, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information (as defined herein) [and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.]</p>

<p>1.3&nbsp; For purposes of this Privacy Policy, (a) when we use the term &ldquo;<ins>Personal Information</ins>&rdquo; we mean any information that we collect on or through the Services that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, email address, physical address, payment card information, telephone number(s), etc., and (b) when we use the term &ldquo;<ins>Additional Information</ins>&rdquo;, we mean any information that we collect about you on or through the Services other than Personal Information (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to herein as &ldquo;<ins>Information</ins>&rdquo;).</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp; INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU</strong></p>

In addition, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive additional newsletters, email communications, other communications and promotions from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information and other news about the Services, and to publicize and promote certain events, content, initiatives, programs, products and services offered by us, which may require that you provide certain Information.</p>
