Therefore, pursuant to the California Civil Code, we are not required to maintain or disclose a list of the third parties that received your Personal Information for marketing purposes during the preceding year. If you are a California resident and wish to request information about how to exercise your third party disclosure choices, please send a request by email to our Privacy Officer at <a href="mailto:privacy@brooklynmuseum.org">privacy@brooklynmuseum.org</a> detailing your privacy request.

If you visit, access, interact with, and/or otherwise use the Services from a location outside the United States, please be advised that any Information you provide in connection with any such activity may be processed in and/or transferred to the United States of America and/or other territories and locations, where privacy protections may not be as comprehensive as those in the territory or location where you interact with or otherwise use the Services.</p>

<p><strong>13. DATA PROTECTION PRIVACY UNDER THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;)</strong></p>

<p>The GDPR protects personal data collected from citizens of European Union Member States. The Museum collects and stores certain personal data through our Site, Apps, in person, or over the phone for the reasons set forth above in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>In order for the Museum to collect this information, you must consent to the collection of your Information. The Museum will only use your Information for the purposes established in this Privacy Policy, unless we discover another purpose that is in line with the Museum&rsquo;s original purpose for collection.

The Museum will store your Information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the Information was collected and processed, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, accounting, or reporting requirements.
