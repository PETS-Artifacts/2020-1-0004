                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel4" role="tab"><h4 class="p1"><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
<p class="p2">Guidelines regarding confidential and sensitive content on a USD website, how information is secured on USD web servers, as well as how web systems are monitored.</p>
<p class="p2">By default any information stored on USD web servers is not secured and can be viewed by anyone and may be crawled by search engines. In addition, any information stored on USD-affiliated websites created <strong>outside the sandiego.edu domain</strong> are not secured. As a result, websites should not collect and store confidential or sensitive information unless the data can be properly secured.</p>
<h4 class="p2"><strong>Application</strong></h4>
<p class="p2">These policies apply to websites on the USD domain (*.sandiego.edu) that are supported by ITS University Web Services, as well as personal USD Sites (WordPress-powered) websites.</p>
<p class="p2">University websites and personal WordPress websites will be reviewed annually by University Web Services to assess ongoing security of data and check for any inappropriate confidential or sensitive information.</p>
<p class="p2">University Web Services will periodically review storage utilization reports and file listings for the campus web server and will contact persons who violate this procedure and request they remove the offending files or provide justification for their storage on the campus web server.</p>
<h4 class="p2"><strong>Practice/Standard</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Acceptable use</strong> and <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/legal/policies/community/technology/computing.pdf"><span class="s1">responsible use of university computing resources</span></a> applies to all maintainers who add content to any pages on the USD website.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Confidential and sensitive data</strong>, including FERPA and HIPAA, is identified in the <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/documents/its/Finance_ITSMemo.pdf"><span class="s1">Information Security Policy</span></a>. Servers are scanned for specific violations on a periodic basis.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Security against hackers and malware attacks.</strong> For security purposes and to make sure USD websites and personal WordPress websites remain available to all users, we use special software programs and scripts to monitor network traffic and identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the system. These programs collect no information that would directly identify individuals, but can collect information to help identify someone attempting to tamper with USD websites.&#160; Activities may be monitored and recorded. Anyone using USD websites expressly consents to such monitoring.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Obtaining access to a university website.</strong> Any USD-affiliated department/organization, faculty/staff member or student is eligible to add content to the site. For the university website, users must complete the Content Management System (CMS) training and e-mail <a href="mailto:web@sandiego.edu"><span class="s1">web@sandiego.edu</span></a> after training is complete to have their account created. All academic and administrative websites must be housed on the university web server and are required to use the *.sandiego.edu domain.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Obtaining a personal USD Sites website.</strong> The university provides a USD Sites (WordPress-driven) solution offering users a web-based content management system and themes to choose from.&#160;USD Sites&#160;is a self-service personal or professional website system that can be used to build class websites, e-portfolios, individual or group blogs, or project or group websites. There are several dynamic USD-branded themes to choose from allowing you to create your website with little coding knowledge or web software needed. Activate your account by completing the 'Register' form on the&#160;<a href="%22htt"><span class="s2">USD Sites</span></a>&#160;landing page. Currently, there is no technical assistance provided for this intuitive platform&#160;after your account is opened. Refer to <a href="http://wordpress.org./"><span class="s2">Wordpress.org</span></a>&#160;for documentation and other resources.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Web Server Storage.</strong> The campus web servers should only be used to store files that are needed for the website. They should not be used as file storage space for files not needed for the actual website. This would include all non-web files, unedited images or video clips, or personal files. Appropriate usage of storage space is reviewed periodically.</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="p1"><strong>Exceptions</strong></h4>
<p class="p1">It is highly discouraged to create a separate domain from sandiego.edu. However, if an exception is made on an outside server, such as through Squarespace, GoDaddy, etc., the same policies apply for exposing confidential/sensitive information. However, these spaces cannot be maintained or monitored by University Web Services.</p>
<h4 class="p1"><strong>Examples of Potential Cases</strong></h4>

<li>After an account owner leaves the university his/her USD Sites account will be closed; if the individual oversees organizational or group accounts beyond a personal or professional site or blog for themselves, the affected sites/blogs will need to be transferred to new ownership in order to remain open.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Design</h4>
<ul>
<li>Only themes designed and developed by or through University Web Services can be used on USD Sites. We cannot upload custom themes for users at this time, as we do not provide access to the CSS or other features that would be needed for customizing individual sites or blogs.</li>
<li>When a site or blog is activated it automatically receives the &#8216;standard&#8217; theme; to select one of the other options, please see the&#160;<a href="http://sites.sandiego.edu/theme-gallery/" title="Theme Gallery">theme gallery</a>.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<ul>
<li>All blogs in the USD Sites service must have comments moderated (i.e. reviewed prior to publication).</li>
<li>Blogs will be set up with moderation enabled, and blog owners are responsible for ensuring that moderation takes place.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Recommendations</h4>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel7" role="tab"><h4 class="columns">The Law</h4>
<p>A federal law related to commercial e-mail is now in effect.&#160; The "Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003" or "CAN-SPAM Act of 2003" was signed into law in January 2004.&#160; This law will provide some relief from the ever-increasing amount of spam e-mail that we all receive.&#160;</p>
<p>One of the keys to this new law is that it applies to many types of e-mail messages and has very specific requirements for&#160;<em>commercial e-mail that offers or promotes products or services</em>. Upon review we have found that this law applies to a considerable amount of e-mail that is sent to recipients both on and off campus from USD organizations and individuals. This laws covers not only unsolicited commercial e-mail, but also electronic communications where the recipient has initiated the exchange.&#160; There are some exceptions for e-mail sent as a result of our transactional relationship (students, employees, vendors, etc.), however the exclusions are very specific and examples are detailed below.</p>
<p>In general we must ensure that we are truthful in addresses and subject descriptions and offer recipients an opportunity to decline from receiving future messages. It is important to remember that if an individual has opted out from receiving unsolicited commercial e-mail from USD and is sent another e-mail message covered by this law, then the University can be fined up to $750 per unlawful message.&#160; To reduce the possibility of this occurring we are in the process of instituting policies and capabilities to comply with the law while minimizing the effect on the business of the University.</p>
<h4>How it Affects You</h4>
<p>Any individual, group, or organization (internal or external to USD) that sends an e-mail on behalf of the University that promotes a commercial product or service is affected.&#160; Frequently as part of our normal course of business, e-mail messages are sent to faculty, staff, students, alumni, and others informing them of upcoming events and activities.&#160; If there is a charge for engaging in these activities or receiving services, then this new law is applicable.&#160; The law does not make a distinction between an electronic communication to a single recipient or a mass e-mail campaign.</p>
<p>While the new law covers all commercial e-mail, there are specific requirements to provide notices and opt-out capability for specific types of e-mail messages.</p>
<h4>What types of e-mail communications are subject to the notice and opt-out requirement?</h4>
<p>Here are some examples of messages that would be affected by the new law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tickets for a play, movie or event where there is charge for admittance. It doesn't matter whether the event is on or off our campus.</li>
<li>E-mail sent to student prospects. You must provide them with an opt-out notice, even if they have initiated the e-mail exchange.</li>
<li>An offer to sell computers, cars, furniture, or just about anything. This applies whether you are offering the items through your capacity at USD or using your USD e-mail&#160; account for personal use. If it is on behalf of the University, then USD is considered the sender.</li>
<li>An external organization sending electronic e-mail on behalf of the University. For example a marketing or publishing company that sends an electronic newsletter or e-mail that contains any promotion for a commercial product or service such as an athletic event, play, or exhibit.</li>
<li>An e-mail that contains a Web link to a USD site that promotes a product or service. For example, a link to a USD Web page that sells clothing. This would not apply if you were including a link to&#160;<a aria-expanded="false" href="http://www.sandiego.edu/">http://www.sandiego.edu</a>&#160;in a non-commercial e-mail message.</li>
</ul>
<h4>General Requirements for Commercial Email</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide recipients with a clear and conspicuous opportunity to decline (opt-out) to receive further commercial e-mail messages from USD. We can provide an opportunity for the recipient to specify the types of messages they decline to accept. In any case we must provide the capability for them to opt-out from&#160;<em>all</em>&#160;commercial e-mail from USD.</li>
<li>Include a fully functional and clearly displayed return e-mail address or other Internet-based mechanism to comply with the opt-out option described above.</li>
<li>If the e-mail message is unsolicited (exchange not initiated by the recipient) they you must clearly indicate that it is an advertisement or solicitation. The opt-out message we provide below provides this notification.</li>
<li>Include the valid physical postal address of USD. Post office boxes are not acceptable.</li>
<li>Subject lines and headers must be accurate. This applies to all e-mail.</li>
<li>The "from" line must be accurate. No anonymous, fictitious, or misleading addresses are permitted.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What types of electronic communications are not subject to notice or opt-out requirements?</h4>
<p>If the email is directly related to an employment or transactional relationship or is non-commercial in nature, then it is not affected.&#160; This is narrowly defined by the law and doesn't provide for very much variance. Here are some examples that would be exempt from the new law:</p>
<div class="content active" id="accordion-panel4" role="tab">
<ul>
<li>Human resources sending email directly related to benefit plans in which the recipient is currently involved, participating, or enrolled. An e-mail describing changes in benefits would be exempt, while an e-mail describing discounts for products or services would require the disclaimer.</li>
<li>Financial Aid sending email related to loans and grants for which the student is either currently receiving or has applied for consideration.</li>
<li>An electronic message that details charges that are owed to the University.</li>
<li>Announcements of free events or services. If any money is collected, whether or not it is clearly indicated in the e-mail, it is covered by the law.</li>
<li>An electronic newsletter sent by an external organization on behalf of USD that does not contain any solicitation or advertisement of product or services.</li>
</ul>
<p>While e-mail that is clearly not commercial in nature is exempt from the disclaimer, it may be prudent to offer individuals an opportunity to opt-out from your list. Of course this would not be applicable to e-mails that involve a transactional relationship.</p>
<h4>How do you comply with the new law?</h4>
<p>If your email message meets the above criteria we have developed methods for both internal and external mailing. If in doubt, please call the Tech Support Center (x7900) and we will help you make the determination.</p>
<h4>Internal Mailings</h4>
<p>We have modified the on-campus mass email system to accommodate the new law. You can submit your e-mail through the existing approval process and we will append the necessary notice and only send your message to the appropriate individuals.</p>
<h4>External Mailings</h4>
<p>We have two methods of compliance:</p>
<p>1. A Web site has been created where you can compose your message (or cut and paste) and upload your list of addresses. The system will automatically append the required notice and cleanse your list of opt-out addresses before sending the message. This is a limited access site, currently only available to a few people that represent the Vice Presidents in their area.&#160;</p>
<p><span>NOTE:</span>&#160;If you need access to this site, please contact the Tech Support Center and we can help you.</p>
<p>2. Another capability on the Web site is the ability to upload an address list and the system will purge your list of opt-out addresses and then return to you a clean list. This address list is a file that contains e-mail addresses that are delimited by commas, tabs, or one on each line.</p>
<p>You can then take your list and use your own email program to compose and send your message. You will need to append the opt-out notice at the end of your message.</p>
<p>If you have external organizations that send email on the behalf of&#160; USD, you could pass the address list through this system and obtain a clean file that can be sent to the vendor. It will be important that everyone uses the same opt-out link for email. This is especially important for external vendors.&#160; If they don't use our opt-out link, we won't know the preferences of the recipients for other email, which could jeopardize our compliance.</p>
<h4>Opt-Out Notice</h4>
<p>The following notice will be appended to all commercial email messages:</p>
<p><span>This message is considered a commercial message. You have the option of opting out of receiving commercial messages from USD or only from a specific area. You can visit the&#160;<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/optout">USD Opt Out of Commercial Messages</a>&#160;site for more information.</span></p>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel8" role="tab"><h4>Rationale</h4>
<p>USD's academic and business units require continuous use of network services in order to reach both on-campus and Internet resources.&#160; Devices that have been compromised or improperly configured can negatively affect services to part or all of the USD community. In order to prevent this from occurring, the attachment of equipment to USD's network is regulated by Information Technology Services.</p>
<h4>Statement</h4>
<p>The University of San Diego requires that all network devices (e.g., hubs, wireless access points, routers) connected to the campus network must be approved by the ITS department. Actual connections of such devices to the campus network must be performed by the ITS department.</p>
<h4>Standards</h4>
<ol class="list_indent">
<li>Only authorized personnel from the ITS department may connect devices to USD's network. No other USD employees or students may do so.</li>
<li>Non-University personnel and outside vendors can gain temporary connection to the campus network via a designated campus point of contact. The campus point of contact is responsible for arranging initiation and termination of the temporary connection with ITS. Requests for network service may be sent to&#160;<a href="mailto:telecom@sandiego.edu">telecom@sandiego.edu</a>.</li>
<li>Access to campus building wiring closets is limited to Network Services and Telecommunications staff only.</li>
<li>Changes to campus network routing and topology are limited to the NETS staff.</li>
<li>Any attached wired or wireless devices that cause a service disruption will be removed from the campus network.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Areas Covered</h4>
<p>All areas of the University, its students, vendors, visitors, and other guests, are covered.</p>

                                                                        <li class="accordion-navigation" id="accordion10"><a href="#accordion-panel10">Email Transition Policy</a>
                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel10" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This policy is intended to clarify a long standing practice of transitioning email accounts for business continuity purposes when USD employment is ended.</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The Practice/Standards below apply to USD administrator and staff email accounts.&#160;&#160; They do not apply to faculty and student email accounts.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>Faculty who end employment with USD and who are entitled to retain their email accounts for life due to retirement/emeritus status will retain their existing email account name in the sandiego.edu domain.&#160;</p>
<p>Students who end employment with USD and have email accounts in Torero Mail (Gmail) will retain their existing email account name in the sandiego.edu domain.</p>
<h4>Practice/Standard</h4>
<p>When administrators and staff end employment with USD, the University of San Diego will assess the need for transitioning email accounts for business continuity reasons.&#160; This assessment is done on a case-by-case basis and is typically initiated through a request from a supervisor within a business or academic unit (such as Associate Dean, Director, Business Officer, Human Resource Officer, etc.).&#160;&#160;&#160; Requests to forward administrator/staff email for business continuity reasons must be submitted to the Vice Provost/CIO or Senior Director of NISS (Network Infrastructure Systems and Services) for consideration.&#160; An ITS Help Desk Ticket will be created to manage the request and steps associated with creating the email forwarding. &#160;If the request is determined to have merit, then the existing administrator/staff email account will have mail forwarding turned and email will be routed to an appropriate person in the business or academic unit.&#160; The email forwarding will be turned on for a 90-day period. &#160;&#160;If the departing administrator or staff member is entitled to retain their email account for life, because they qualify under alumni status, then they will be issued an entirely new Torero Mail (Gmail) account name in the sandiego.edu domain.&#160; However, if the departing administrator or staff member is entitled to retain their email account for life, because they qualify under the retirement benefit provision, then they will be issued an entirely new Microsoft Exchange email account for life.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>When employment ends for an administrator or staff member who is also an actively enrolled University of San Diego student, then the existing email account will be retained by that individual for academic purposes.&#160;&#160; Specifically, the account name will be retained in the sandiego.edu domain; however the email account may be transitioned from Microsoft Exchange to Torero Mail (Gmail).&#160;&#160; Forwarding of email for business continuity purposes cannot be provided in this case.</p>
<h4>Examples of Potential Cases</h4>
<ul>
<li>Administrator or staff employee leaves USD (employment ends due to change of job, retirement, termination) and the individual&#160;<strong><span>does not qualify</span></strong>&#160;for &#8220;email benefit&#8221; for retiree, alumni or emeritus status. OUTCOME: Microsoft Exchange email account is automatically disabled; in 18 months the account is deleted. If warranted,&#160;<strong><span>email forwarding is turned on for business continuity purposes to send email to another USD employee in the business unit</span></strong>.&#160;</li>
<li>Administrator or staff employee leaves USD (employment ends due to change of job, retirement, termination) and the individual&#160;<strong><span>does qualify</span></strong>&#160;for &#8220;email benefit&#8221; as an alumni. OUTCOME: Microsoft Exchange email account, contacts, and calendar events are ported over to USD Student/Alumni Torero Mail (Gmail) for life.&#160; If warranted,&#160;<strong><span>email forwarding is turned on for business continuity purposes to send email to another USD employee in the business unit</span></strong>.&#160; Note that the mailbox owner is responsible for porting non-business related email and contacts to Torero Mail. In 18 months the Microsoft Exchange email account is deleted.</li>
<li>Death of an Employee.&#160; OUTCOME: Microsoft Exchange email account is automatically disabled; the Vice President of the Division or Dean is consulted and&#160;<strong><span>email forwarding is turned on for business continuity purposes to send email to another USD employee in the business unit if warranted</span></strong>.&#160; In 18 months the account is deleted.</li>
<li>Administrator or staff employee leaves USD (employment ends due to change of job, retirement, termination); the individual&#160;<strong><span>does qualify</span></strong>&#160;for &#8220;email benefit&#8221; under retiree status. OUTCOME: Microsoft Exchange email account, contacts, and calendar events are ported over to&#160;<strong><span>an entirely new Microsoft Exchange email account&#160;</span></strong>for life (the retiree would be issued a new email account name).&#160; The original Microsoft Exchange email account is disabled but&#160;<strong><span>email forwarding is turned on for business continuity purposes to send email to another USD employee in the business unit</span></strong>.&#160; In 18 months the original Microsoft Exchange account is deleted.</li>
<li>Administrator or staff employee (primary role) is also an enrolled USD student and leaves USD (employment ends due to change of job, retirement, termination) and retains student status.&#160; OUTCOME: Microsoft Exchange email account, contacts, and calendar events are ported over to USD Student/Alumni Torero Mail (Gmail) for life.&#160;&#160;<strong><span>Business continuity requests cannot be honored</span></strong>&#160;because the student&#8217;s access to academic course content and student administrative roles in Banner, MySanDiego, and Blackboard must be maintained with the existing sandiego.edu account.&#160; In 18 months the Microsoft Exchange email account is deleted.</li>

                                                                        <li class="accordion-navigation" id="accordion11"><a href="#accordion-panel11">Windows Server Installation and Configuration Policy</a>
                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel11" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This policy is intended to standardize the deployment of WINDOWS SERVERS (i.e., Windows 2012 R2 Server, etc.)</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The Practice/Standard applies to all USD ITS staff members, vendors, and contractors who require or have the ability to install the Window Operating System in either Virtual Servers (VM&#8217;s running inside the VCE vBlock system in University of San Diego datacenters) OR install and configure the Windows Server Operating System on physical hardware (e.g. a Dell Server within a University of San Diego datacenter).&#160; For change management purposes and to facilitate a documentation of our servers,&#160; installation and configuration steps are initiated with a Footprints (Helpdesk) ticket requesting the server be created and assigned to a member of the ITS Systems Team.</p>
<h4>Practice/Standards</h4>
<p>This Practice/Standard extends to USD ITS System Administrators and Architects, or anyone who is authorized by an Infrastructure Manager or Sr. Director to deploy a&#160;<strong><span>Windows</span></strong>&#160;Server.</p>
<h5>a. Installation</h5>
<p>Requests come in via ITS Help Desk&#8217;s ticketing system and are approved by Systems team Manager.&#160; Once approved, a Windows System Administrator and/or Architect will begin installation.&#160; Base installation is deployed via Virtual Server template.&#160; See Windows Server Install Check List for building VM Template.</p>
<h5>b. Configuring/Updating</h5>
<p>Standard practice is to check/perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request IP&#8217;s and use IP&#8217;s provided by the Networking team.</li>
<li>Install all Windows updates and configure &#8220;Download but let me install them&#8221;.</li>
<li>Install the latest AV program and updated (4 hours) by local Symantec Endpoint server.</li>
<li>Join to the AD Domain.</li>
<li>Configure Firewall.</li>
<li>Configure SNMP to accept monitoring via OpenNMS.</li>
<li>Add root password to Secret Server.</li>
<li>Add necessary Local Admin privilege to AD user to administer application.</li>
<li>Add AD account to Remote Group for Application Administrator.</li>
</ul>
<h5>c. Disabling/De-provisioning</h5>
<p>De-provisioning will come for the application owner that system is no longer needed.<strong>&#160;&#160;</strong>System will then be shut down and typically sit for a period of 1 month before be deleted or removed from inventory.</p>
<h5>d. Documentation</h5>
<p>More technical documentation is kept by System Administrator and/or Architect. / See Appendix for Installation Checklist.</p>
<h5>e.&#160;Windows Updates</h5>
<p>Updates to the operating system will be performed automatically (e.g. Monthly) based upon update availability from Microsoft.&#160; However; software vendors/applications will sometimes insist that the &#8216;latest&#8217; version of an operating system or service (e.g. Apache) are not yet supported.&#160; In this case, updates are delayed.</p>
<h5>d. Anti-Virus Updates/Scanning/Monitoring</h5>
<p>Anti-Virus updates shall be set to automatic every 4 hours. &#8220;Live Scanning&#8221; and alerting are also automatically configured. Server scans should be done weekly during off hours as not to impact server/disk performance.</p>
<p>Monitoring is set to automatic reporting to the AV Dashboard in both ITS Help Desk and Systems Area. Alerts of a virus should be routed to the ITS Help Desk ticketing system with the following information;</p>
<ul>
<li>Username or computer name information</li>
<li>Virus information</li>
<li>Dispatch Desktop service technician for remediation</li>
</ul>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>In rare cases, some software manufacturers will not support additional software running on a server (i.e. CommVault Simpana Backup Agent, Symantec Endpoint Anti-Virus Software, etc.)&#160; In these rare cases additional steps are required by the Systems Administrator/Architect to make sure the system is backed up and secure.</p>
<h4>Appendix &#8211; Update/Security Requirements</h4>
<ul>
<li>Prior to turning the server over to the requestor (client), the latest GA operating system updates are installed/deployed.</li>
<li>Configure Anti-Virus for &#8220;Live Scan&#8221; and automatic &#8220;Quarantine&#8221;</li>
<li>Configure Anti-Virus for weekly scan during off-hours.</li>
<li>If the server will need access from outside the USD campus (i.e. a NAT request on Port X thru the main USD firewall) the system is scanned for open ports/vulnerabilities by the ITS Systems Security Administrator Prior to turning the server over to the requestor (client).</li>

                                                                        <li class="accordion-navigation" id="accordion12"><a href="#accordion-panel12">Computer Equipment Replacement</a>
                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel12" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>ITS follows several procedural guidelines for the Computer Replacement Program to ensure that employees can request and receive upgraded technology in a timely manner.</p>
<p>Eligible employees should contact their faculty/staff representative, area technician, or a staff member in Information Technology Services as the third anniversary of their desktop equipment approaches or to find out if their computer is up for replacement. All appropriate administrative and technical representatives are listed on our&#160;<a href="../../resources/hardware/" title="Hardware">Computer Options</a>&#160;site.</p>
<p align="left">Eligible employees should review standard computer configurations and specifications on the Computer Options Web site. Standard specifications are reviewed and updated biannually (or as needed) so that USD employees have access to current information tools.</p>
<p>Employees may then submit their computer requests to their faculty/staff representative. Employees are strongly encouraged to speak with their area technician prior to submitting a request form so that the equipment requested meets the employee's work requirements. No changes or modifications can be made to a request after the equipment has been approved and ordered. The employee's department will be responsible for purchase of any external hardware items for the system if additional capabilities become necessary after the fact.</p>
<p>Approved requests are forwarded to Information Technology Services for ordering. Orders are placed every few weeks, since ITS normally places orders in bulk to receive discounted pricing.</p>
<p>Depending on the vendor involved, computer systems generally take one to three weeks to arrive to campus. After a system arrives to campus, it is placed into the queue of a member of Desktop Support Services who images and prepares the computer. You will then be contacted to schedule an appointment for installation of your new computer and pickup of your old computer system.</p>
<p><strong>Please note that when your new computer is delivered and installed in your office, the displaced equipment cannot remain in your office.</strong>&#160;Prior instances of this practice resulted in a shortfall of recycled workstations for part-time faculty, staff, and student employees not eligible for equipment through the Computer Replacement Program. More importantly, with the recent changes in state law, there is an increased liability associated with accidental release of personal information. We need to ensure that all disk contents are removed before a workstation is reallocated for other uses, even if this is within the same office. We also need to ensure that workstations are maintained with current security patches and updated anti-virus software.</p>
<p>After you receive your new computer (or if you have received a computer through the replacement program in the past), you cannot swap the system with a co-worker. At no time is it permissible to exchange equipment with other co-workers or other departments. We inventory machines by employee name and computer serial number and exchanging equipment makes it difficult for us to locate and collect equipment when it is needed for return.</p></div>

                                                                        <li class="accordion-navigation" id="accordion13"><a href="#accordion-panel13">Wireless Spectrum Management Policy</a>
                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel13" role="tab"><h4><span>Purpose</span></h4>
<p>This policy is intended to provide a mechanism for managing the wireless communications spectrum at the University of San Diego.&#160; Wireless communications for data, voice, and video are an increasingly important part of the overall technology plan of the University.&#160; Thoughtful management of that spectrum will improve reliability, availability and security of these services to all members of our community.&#160; This policy applies only to over-the-air use of wireless spectrum.&#160; It does not include any broadcast over wired systems, such as Cable TV.</p>
<h4><span>Definitions</span></h4>
<h5>Access Point:</h5>
<p>An access point is a device which is intended to provide a communication path from a wireless network to a wired network.</p>
<h5>Wireless Network Interface Card (WNIC):</h5>
<p>A Wireless Network Interface Card is a device which is installed into a computing system for the purpose of communication with a wireless network operating in an unregulated band.&#160; A computing system includes, but is not limited to desktop computer, laptop computer, workstation, cellphone, smart phone, tablet, mablet, and various wearable wireless devices when using an unlicensed band.</p>
<h4><span>Policy</span></h4>
<p>This policy applies to both the licensed and unlicensed portions of the Radio Frequency Spectrum.&#160; It does not apply to wireless technologies which are outside of that spectrum, such as Infrared.</p>
<h5>Licensed Spectrum:</h5>
<p>The use of licensed spectrum is controlled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/its/about/policies/WirelessSpectrumManagementPolicy.php#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1" name="_ftnref1">&#160;</a>.&#160; It is the responsibility of the license holder to maintain a valid license and to comply with all applicable Federal, State and Local regulations regarding the use of such equipment.&#160; Departments which utilize licensed spectrum must annually report the frequencies used to the Senior Director of Network Infrastructure Systems and Services.</p>
<h5>Unlicensed Spectrum:</h5>
<p>The FCC provides several portions of the R Spectrum for public use without licensing. While the lack of license requirements provides accessibility, the lack of control increases the likelihood of radio interference.</p>
<p>Currently, the FCC provides the following Spectra for unlicensed use 902-948 MHz, 2400 &#8211; 2483.5 MHz and 5725-5850 MHz<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/its/about/policies/WirelessSpectrumManagementPolicy.php#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2" name="_ftnref2">&#160;</a>. This policy will apply to any future unlicensed spectrum which may from time to time be made available by the FCC.&#160; Should such bandwidth become available, the most restrictive policy will apply.&#160; Each section of Spectrum has difference requirements and will be treated separately.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>902-928MHz:&#160;</strong>This band is typically used by consumer electronics such as cordless telephones.
<ul>
<li>Restrictions: No reporting is required.&#160; Users causing interference to any other frequency user are expected and required to amend their usage to eliminate interference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>2400-2483.5 MHz:&#160;</strong>This band is currently used for a variety of technologies today, including Bluetooth, Cordless Telephones, and 802.11, WiFi.
<ul>
<li><strong>Bluetooth:&#160;</strong>There are no restrictions for Bluetooth users.&#160; Bluetooth use may cause interference with other devices in this spectrum and with each other.&#160; Users causing interference for any other user are expected and required to amend their usage to eliminate the interference.&#160; Failure to perform such remediation could result in removal of access by the University.&#160; Due to the limited security available with Bluetooth devices, users are responsible for ensuring the proper security for all of their devices.</li>
<li><strong>Cordless Telephone:&#160;</strong>Cordless Telephones that operate in this spectrum may not be used.</li>
<li><strong>802.11, WiFi:</strong>&#160;Information Technology Services is responsible for the deployment of a campus-wide wireless network.&#160; No Access Points may be installed without the express, written permission of the Information Systems Department.&#160; In cases where particular locations on campus are not served, members of the University of San Diego Community may request access contracting the Information Technology Services Help Desk.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>5725-5850 MHz:&#160;</strong>&#160;This spectrum is reserved solely for&#160; Data Communications purposes.&#160; No Access Points operating within this spectrum may be installed on campus without the express written permission of the Chief Information Officer, University of San Diego.&#160; Only University approved WNICs may be used.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Security:</h5>
<p>Due to the public nature of the wireless signals themselves, access to the University of San Diego Wireless network is permitted only to persons with valid USD Network Accounts.&#160; Visitors and guests that have a valid requirement for access to the Campus Wireless Network will be granted such access.&#160; Assistance with guest wireless may be obtained through the USD USD ITS Help Desk (x7900) or online at help@sandiego.edu.</p>
<h5>Standards:</h5>
<p>It is the policy of the University of San Diego to standardize personal computing technologies whenever possible.&#160; Non-standard Access Points are not permitted.&#160; Non-Standard WNICs are permitted, but will not be supported by Information Technology Services.&#160; Such non-standard WNICs must comply with all appropriate 802.11 standards.&#160; WNICs which do not conform will be removed from the campus network.</p>
<h4><span>Applicability</span></h4>
<p>The University&#8217;s policies on Responsible Use of University Computing Resources (Policy 2.5.1) applies to the use of all devices on the University Wireless Data Network.</p>
<h4><span>Disciplinary Action</span></h4>
<p>Violations of this policy may result in the suspension of access to the University Network.&#160; Appeal of any decision related to this policy may be made to the Vice Provost and Chief Information Officer.</p>
<h4><span>Responsibility and Oversight</span></h4>
<p>The Chief Information Officer is responsible for implementing this policy.&#160; The policy may be revised from time to time as required by the Committee on Information Technology.</p>

<p>This policy is intended to standardize the deployment of LINUX SERVERS (i.e., Red Hat Enterprise Server v6.x, etc.)</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The Practice/Standard applies to all USD ITS staff members, vendors and contractors who require or have the ability to install the Linux Operating System in either Virtual Servers (VM&#8217;s running inside the VCE vBlock system in University of San Diego data centers) OR install and configure the Linux Server Operating System on physical hardware (e.g. a Dell Server within a University of San Diego data center). For change management purposes and to facilitate a documentation of our servers,&#160; installation and configuration steps are initiated with a Footprints (Helpdesk) ticket requesting the server be created and assigned to a member of the ITS Systems Team.</p>
<h4>Practice/Standard</h4>
<p>This Practice/Standard extends to USD ITS System Administrators and Architects, or anyone who is authorized by an Infrastructure Manager, Director or CIO to deploy a&#160;<strong><span>Linux</span></strong>&#160;Server.</p>
<h5>a. Installation</h5>
<p>Requests are received via USD&#8217;s ticketing system (Footprints) and are approved by ITS Systems Team Manager.&#160; Following approval, the Linux System Administrator and/or Systems Architect begins the instillation.&#160; The base installation is configured and then deployed via vSphere templates.</p>
<h5>b. Configuring/Updating</h5>
<p>Standard practice is to check/perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure networking with IP address provided from networking group.</li>
<li>Setup Red Hat Subscription manager to allow for updates.</li>
<li>Perform updates - Automated/Manual yum updates configured per applications team requirements.</li>
<li>Check and configure NTP for accurate system time.</li>
<li>Configure SNMP for data collection and monitoring via our OpenNMS system.</li>
<li>Confirm local firewall is running to allow only specified ports from per the applications team.</li>
<li>Add root password to Secret Server.</li>
<li>Install Centrify for Active Directory authorization/login.&#160; Allow only groups and users that need access.</li>
<li>Add necessary Active Directory groups or users to sudoers, to allow root level access.</li>
</ul>
<h5>c. Disabling/De-provisioning</h5>
<p>A request from the application owner (ITS or business unit) that system is no longer needed.&#160; System will then be shut down and typically sit idle for a period of one month prior to being deleted or removed from inventory.</p>
<h5>d. Documentation</h5>
<p>Technical documentation is kept by ITS System Administrator and/or Systems Architect.</p>
<h5>e. Future Updates</h5>
<p>Updates to the operating system will be performed regularly (e.g. Monthly) based upon update availability from the vendor (e.g. Red Hat).&#160; However, there are instances when updates are delayed because a software/application vendor insists that the &#8216;latest&#8217; version of an operating system or service (e.g. Apache) is not yet supported.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>In rare cases, some software manufacturers will not support additional software running on a server (i.e. CommVault Simpana Backup Agent, Symantec Endpoint Anti-Virus Software, etc.)&#160; In these rare cases additional steps are required by the Systems Administrator/Architect to make sure the system is backed up and secure.</p>
<h4>Appendix &#8211; Update/Security Requirements</h4>
<p>1.&#160; Prior to turning the server over to the requestor (client/business unit), the latest GA operating system updates are installed/deployed.</p>
<p>2.&#160; If the server will need access from outside the USD campus (i.e. a NAT request on Port X thru the main USD firewall) the system is scanned for open ports/vulnerabilities by the ITS Systems Security Administrator prior to turning the server over to the requestor (client/business unit).</p>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel16" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This policy is to standardize remote access of university private electronic resources for the purpose of accessing, updating, managing data, systems and/or applications remotely (off-campus).</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The Practice/Standard applies to all USD employees (faculty and staff), internal and external contractors, and vendors. &#160;All remote access for business, maintenance, or upgrade purposes to the university&#8217;s electronic resources and systems must be conducted through the university&#8217;s Virtual Private Network (VPN) or secure Tunnel.&#160; Microsoft Active Directory (AD) is the sole source of authentication for VPN requests.</p>
<p>In rare instances, USD students may receive remote access privileges for grant and/or research purposes that is sponsored by a USD tenured or tenure-track faculty member.&#160;&#160; Any such privileges for students are limited for one semester and will expire at the end on the semester.&#160; Application for a student VPN account will require supporting documentation of the research activity from the faculty member.</p>
<h4><strong>Practice/Standard</strong></h4>
<p>All faculty and staff requiring access to the university&#8217;s electronic resources for business, maintenance or upgrade access must use the university provided VPN portal. Staff and Faculty requests for VPN access to the university&#8217;s electronic resources must have approval from their supervisor, manager, or department chair or Dean.&#160;&#160;<a href="../../documents/about-documents/staff_faculty_user_registration_form.pdf" title="Staff and Faculty VPN User Registration Form">(VPN Request Form)</a>&#160;is required for anyone seeking privileges for remote access.&#160;&#160; The account access form must be completed with all signatures and submitted for processing to&#160;<a href="mailto:noc@sandiego.edu">Network Operations</a></p>
<p>Vendor/Contractor access requires a university sponsor, with an account access form signed by the sponsor with a specified end date. &#160;Vendor/Contractor VPN Access will be granted only during the university&#8217;s normal work day. &#160;If a business requirement necessitates the normal work day in the Vendor&#8217;s/Contractor&#8217;s time zone, the specific application, systems, or services and the associated ports to be accessed must be specified by the Vendor/Contractor or university Sponsor at time of VPN request.</p>
<p>Access times and time zone restrictions are managed within USD&#8217;s Active Directory (AD) at the time of the VPN or VPN Tunnel request is configured by the ITS Systems Administrator.</p>
<p>All VPN accounts will be reviewed on a quarterly basis and modified or deleted for compliance with this policy.</p>
<h4><strong>Exceptions</strong></h4>
<p>With the exception of rare instances for research/grant purposes, USD Students and student employees are not granted remote access to the university private electronic resources.</p>
<p>ITS Employees are not allowed access by any other means than the VPN Portal without written approval by the Vice Provost and Chief Information Officer.</p>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel21" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>This policy is intended to specify log monitoring practices for USD&#8217;s Network and Critical Systems.</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>The Practice/Standards apply to system and network logs associated with USD Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), Active Directory (AD), network devices, and Critical Systems.&#160; The Critical Systems are defined through the ITS policy for Review and Identification of Critical Systems.</p>
<h4>Practice/Standard</h4>
<p>The Information Technology Services (ITS) has access to computer system and network device logs; various alerts are generated that inform ITS staff of events or anomalies that occur within any large complex network and computing environment.&#160; This policy establishes standards for log monitoring that will be done in addition to the existing alert systems that are in place.&#160;</p>
<ul>
<li>Oracle Enterprise Grid Control is setup to inform ITS-ERPT DBA team of failed login attempts and monitoring of Oracle Databases associated with &#8220;Critical Systems&#8221; (as defined in USD&#8217;s Review and Identification of Critical Systems Policy,&#160;<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/its/about/policies/">http://www.sandiego.edu/its/about/policies/</a>). These logs and alerts are monitored on a daily basis.&#160; The Database Administrators (DBA) take action by reviewing alerts on a daily basis. If the alerts are deemed malicious the DBA&#8217;s will work the appropriate teams to address risk.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A program to analyze login anomalies to LDAP is used to generate reports that are reviewed on a monthly basis by the ITS-NISS Systems team.&#160; A Solarwinds SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) module is used to identify and report login anomalies to Active Directory (AD).&#160;&#160; The Systems team takes action by reviewing the reports and investigating the accounts in question.&#160;&#160;&#160; If the Systems team determines there is malicious action being performed by the account, they will then contact the user, the helpdesk, and/or public safety as well as USD leadership.&#160;&#160;&#160; Continued review of any accounts in question will continue during subsequent reviews to eliminate any possibility of continued malicious behavior.&#160; Note ITS will seek to improve the frequency of LDAP and Active Directory log reviews on an incremental basis from 1 month to 3 weeks, then 3 weeks to 2 weeks, and eventually to 1 week.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Open NMS and SolarWinds Network Configuration Manager (NCM) are used to monitor the status of all network devices.&#160; The ITS-NISS Systems/Network teams receive notifications/alerts from Open NMS and SolarWinds which are used to identify hardware and infrastructure anomalies. &#160;These alerts are received immediately and are acted upon immediately by the ITS-NISS Systems/Network teams. &#160;Open NMS is used to report on the status of network devices, servers, and normal services; SolarWinds is used to&#160; report on anomalies, the ITS-NISS Systems/Network teams works directly with the application or system owner to investigate and determine if the behavior is suspicious or expected.&#160; If monitored behavior is determined to be malicious the system(s) and/or application will be fixed immediately or shutdown; remediating any potential threat(s) will be the first priority of root cause analysis followed by proactive steps to ensure long-term safety of applications and systems. Open NMS reports are reviewed on a monthly basis.&#160; SolarWinds reports are reviewed on a monthly basis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Checkpoint SmartEvent is used to automate the log aggregation, analysis, monitoring, and reporting associated with data specific to network intrusion and anomalous events that are found in voluminous firewall logs.&#160;&#160; The ITS-NISS Network team is responsible for using the SmartEvent console and reports to identify network security incidents and to investigate them.&#160;&#160; Typical security incidents that are reported in SmartEvent include, but are not limited to:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Denial of Service Attacks</li>
<li>Distributed Denial of Service Attacks</li>
<li>DNS Queries</li>
<li>Bots</li>
<li>Viruses</li>
<li>Malware</li>
<li>Advanced Persistent Threats</li>
<li><em>Port Scans</em></li>
<li><em>High Connection Rate Anomalies</em></li>
<li><em>Application and Server vulnerabilities</em></li>
<li><em>Geo-protection</em></li>
</ul>
<p>SmartEvent reports/analytics are monitored on a daily basis.&#160; Depending on the incident, the ITS-NISS Network team takes action by investigating malicious traffic detected based on the severity of the incident.&#160; The Network Team will configure the IPS protection from "detect" to "prevent" on the particular malicious traffic and/or add the IP address to the "Zero Access" firewall group - which will deny any access to and from the Checkpoint Firewall.&#160; If the source IP address of any malicious traffic is determined to be internal, we will identify the device and/or user.&#160; Upon identification, the ITS-NISS Network team will notify the user, ITS Helpdesk, and/or Systems team to take immediate action to prevent further network access.</p>
<h4>Exceptions</h4>
<p>As important new security applications and tools become available, ITS may opt to supplement or replace the log monitoring and security solutions specified in this policy.</p>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel23" role="tab"><h5>May 26, 2010</h5>
<p><img align="right" alt="iPad." class="art" height="186" src="../../images/about-images/ipad.jpg" width="150"/>This IT procedure pertains to purchasing and IT support of university iPads by USD faculty and staff. It does not apply to the purchase of personal iPads. Personal iPads are not supported by university Information Technology Services.</p>
<p>As of May 26, 2010, a new practice was implemented pertaining to the purchase of Apple iPads at USD. Specifically, these are iPads that are used for University academic and business activities. Requests and justifications for purchases of iPads will be made through Information Technology Services at the following website:</p>
<p><a href="../../resources/ordering/ipad-quote.php" title="iPad Quote Form">http://www.sandiego.edu/its/resources/hardware/ipad.php</a></p>
<p>Requests for reimbursement of an iPad purchase or iPad accessory(ies) purchase made outside the university (for example, at the Apple Store) will be denied by USD Procurement. This procedure also provides proper asset control and allows the university to maximize purchasing power.</p>
<p>Requests for university iPads are required to go through the ITS website and will be reviewed and approved in a manner similar to requests for second computers. All requests must be accompanied by clear justification of academic/business purpose and proper departmental and budget approvals. The iPads purchased through the University will be considered a university technology asset and tagged and inventoried through the ITS asset management system. Please note that any university iPad purchases will include a $99 two-year AppleCare support contract.</p>
<p>The university will not pay for any cellular voice/data plans associated with iPads. Those cellular service plans shall be paid by the individual or with approved departmental budget or grant funds. The individual user, or the user's department with approval, will be responsible for any charges related to acquisition of individual applications for the device. Applications may be purchased directly from the Apple App Store (ie. iTunes) by the user or user's department. If any applications will be paid for with university funds, a justification of academic/business purpose must accompany the invoice receipt.</p>
<p>Future generations of the iPad may resolve current problems with the operating system, printing capabilities, etc. Certainly, if Apple formulates agreements with textbook publishers, it will revolutionize the way academia may deliver textbook content and course packs. In the future, as Apple improves the device, there is a possibility that we will list the Apple iPad as an option in the USD Computer Replacement Program (CRP). This procedure and the procedures will be revised as iPad technology evolves.</p>
<p>For questions about this new purchasing practice, you may contact&#160;<a href="mailto:crp@sandiego.edu?subject=ipad%20orders" title="Email crp@sandiego.edu">crp@sandiego.edu</a>.</p></div>

                                                                        <li class="accordion-navigation" id="accordion24"><a href="#accordion-panel24">Multimedia Equipment Use Policy</a>
                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel24" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>ITS multimedia equipment is intended to support academic activities here on campus. Equipment, facilities, and services are available to USD faculty, staff, students and alumni with a current ID. Individuals are responsible for all equipment they check out, for returning it on time and for paying any fines.</p>
<p>We accept reservations for equipment and basic instruction on equipment operation can be provided. A small inventory of items is available only to faculty and staff. This more restricted list includes laptop computers, data projectors and media cabinet keys.</p>
<p>Items in the ITS inventory have a limited loan period; the length of that period depends on demand for the item and future reservations. Requests for off-campus use are handled on a case-by-case basis.</p>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel25" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>Mass e-mail is a blast message sent to a large group such as all faculty, students, staff, or administrators who have USD e-mail accounts (i.e.:&#160;<em>username@sandiego.edu</em>). It is used to convey emergency information, critical alerts or important information of campus-wide interest.</p>
<p>The MySanDiego portal system has a feature where events can be posted, in addition to emailing an announcement. You can access this page at&#160;<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/mypostings/">MyPostings</a>.</p>
<p>To send a mass e-mail, the following guidelines apply:</p>
<h4>Approval</h4>
<ul class="list_indent">
<li>Emails to the university community (faculty, staff, admin, students) must be sent through this email system. Third party email systems (by vendors or a department's own system) may be used in lieu of this email system ONLY if the message is directed towards external parties (non-university email addresses).</li>
<li>The text of the message must be approved by the Vice President to whom the individual department or group wishing to send the message reports.&#160;See below&#160;for divisional contact person(s) to whom the mass message request should be sent. The divisional contact may also authorize employees in their division to upload e-mails to the mass e-mail queue without having to send their text for approval.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list_indent">
<li>Events can be posted through&#160;<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/mypostings/">MyPostings</a>&#160;in addition to a mass e-mail message being sent. An event is any activity open to a broad group of the university community. Examples: seminars, trainings, conferences, workshops, lectures, receptions, concerts. This does not include private meetings or department meetings.&#160; The mass e-mail system should not be used to send out event reminders, unless for major campus events, such as Commencement, All Faith Service, etc.&#160; A personal message in MyPostings is an option for event reminders.</li>
<li>Messages for enrollment or registration in USD degree programs or classes will not be approved except if they are part of a USD strategic initiative. A personal message in MyPostings is an option.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="list_indent">
<li>Only one message per event or group of events is allowed. If more than one department or division is planning or promoting an event or group of events, it should be decided ahead of time which department or division sends out the mass e-mail. Reminder emails are not allowed.</li>
<li>Requests for mass e-mails ideally should be received by the VP approver at least three (3) business days prior to the requested send date. (Ideally there should be at least two full business days notice for the approved e-mailing.)</li>
<li><a id="approvers" name="approvers"></a>E-mail the full mass e-mail message with subject line, return e-mail address, and designated group to the following individual in the specific vice presidential area:</li>

<li>Please proofread your message closely. No "corrected versions" will be sent after the original message has gone out.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Formatting</h4>
<ul class="list_indent">
<li>There are two templates available (Standard Text and USD HTML). The USD HTML template uses the group or sub-group under which the sender is listed as a header in the body of the message.</li>

<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>DocuSign is an e-signature and workflow solution.&#160; It allows you to electronically send documents for signature and manage the documents you send, allowing for multiple people to sign and the ability to access and store all your documents instantly and securely.&#160; DocuSign is not a contract management system.</p>
<p>To use DocuSign please use the following guidelines:</p>
<h4>Approval</h4>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, it is important to note that the use of DocuSign does not override or circumvent the university&#8217;s Contract Signature Authority Policy.&#160; Please read the policy and confirm that people added as signers to the workflow are authorized to sign contracts and agreements, especially those dealing with money transactions.&#160;<a href="/policies-link" title="Legal Policies">Legal Policies</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Because DocuSign is not a contract management system, contract review and approvals must be made prior to uploading a document in DocuSign.&#160; The university&#8217;s Contract Signature Authority Policy describes the advance review by the Office of the General Counsel and other relevant departments that is required before the execution of a contract.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>To request a DocuSign account, please email&#160;<a href="mailto:docusign@sandiego.edu">docusign@sandiego.edu</a>. Upon approval you will be contacted by your area Desktop Technician who will help with signature upload as well as notification management.&#160; Uploaders (Senders) must attend trainings prior to accessing their accounts and uploading documents.</li>
<li>DocuSign has been approved for internal workflow and e-signature collection.&#160; Should a department wish to use DocuSign with any Third Party vendor/signers, please contact your area&#8217;s budget administrator/assigned sender for upload and routing of documents.&#160; It is important to have approval from the third party vendor to send a document via DocuSign.&#160; Please contact vendors prior to uploading a document to verify they do not require the document to have a &#8220;wet&#8221; signature.</li>

<h4>Signers</h4>
<ul>
<li>Any employee who is authorized to sign an agreement on behalf of the University of San Diego and who chooses to do so through DocuSign must sign the agreement using an official University of San Diego-issued DocuSign account.&#160; Personal or non-USD DocuSign accounts may not be used to sign agreements on behalf of USD.</li>
<li>A signer always has the option to print the document, &#8220;wet&#8221; sign it and return a hard copy to the sender, instead of agreeing to sign a contract through DocuSign. For any questions on signing documents please email&#160;<a href="mailto:docusign@sandiego.edu">docusign@sandiego.edu</a>&#160;or call x4258.&#160;</li>
<li>Signer should not delegate signing authority to those who do not have authorization to sign documents.&#160; In order to maintain the security of DocuSign, please do not give your username and password to anyone.</li>
<li>Please keep personal DocuSign accounts separate from official University of San Diego-issued DocuSign accounts.&#160; Access to USD&#8217;s DocuSign account is made through your University of San Diego email address and your password for that address.&#160; If you have any questions with settings please contact your area Desktop Technician.</li>
<li>Please read the ELECTRONIC RECORD AND SIGNATURE DISCLOSURE found in your DocuSign account under &#8220;PREFERENCES&#8221; or under the &#8220;MORE&#8221; tab prior to signing.</li>
<li>Your electronic signature, with DocuSign, is a legally binding signature.</li>
<li>Under the university&#8217;s Contract Signature Authority Policy, the university official executing the contract is responsible for maintaining the fully-executed contract, including all attachments, in a manner consistent with the university&#8217;s Record Retention Policy.&#160; The university official executing the contract also is responsible for maintaining records evidencing any electronic signatures obtained through DocuSign.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Senders</h4>
<ul>
<li>DocuSign senders must be approved by DocuSign administrators and attend training prior to sending documents through DocuSign.&#160; ITS will either provide training in a lab or one-on-one training, depending on the group.</li>
<li>When creating workflow through DocuSign, it is the responsibility of the sender to verify that all signers for contracts dealing with university affairs or monetary agreements have signature authority.&#160; Please refer to the Contract&#160;<a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/legal/policies/community/financial/contractsignature.pdf">Signature Authority Policy</a>&#160;to verify signing authority.</li>
</ul>

                            <div class="content" id="accordion-panel27" role="tab"><h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of the university website is to access official university information, to disseminate and extend knowledge, and to foster the free exchange of ideas. It is also a valuable asset for marketing and branding the university and for reaching and engaging with the university's prospective students.</p>
<p>The University of San Diego is committed to providing equal access to its official websites and web-based information for all users. This includes persons with disabilities accessing the web through auxiliary technologies, software and hardware.</p>
<h4>Application</h4>
<p>University Web Services makes a concerted effort to comply with the accessibility standards specified in Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.0. In addition, the WCAG 2.0 AA standards are set by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) which provides guidelines to develop websites to their fullest potential, including web accessibility.</p>
<p>University Web Services works in coordination with university Disability Services to provide websites that work with auxiliary technologies available in several locations across campus, such as JAWS&#160;(Windows), Window-Eyes&#160;(Windows), and VoiceOver&#160;(Mac).</p>
<p>This policy applies to University Web Services, website maintainers across campus, students, faculty, and staff that update their own websites through the university&#8217;s content management system (CMS), Cascade Server, or other means (e.g. WordPress). Each web developer and maintainer is responsible for achieving compliance with this policy for pages created by or for their academic area or administrative department.</p>
<h4>Practice/Standard</h4>
<ul>
<li>University Web Services continually improves website standards, including accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.0 Level AA). As guidelines change, retroactive changes are being implemented. Best practices have been put into place to assure that future-forward website creation and updates will attain a high standard.&#160; Accessibility guidelines used in website development can be found at <a data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.sandiego.edu/its/services/web/accessibility/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491937789874000&amp;usg=AFQjCNG8T929RX8NXA6FhYX9A1EMU57J1Q" href="../../services/web/accessibility/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://www.sandiego.edu/its/<wbr/>services/web/accessibility/</a>&#160;.</li>
<li>Basic Standard for Site Accessibility:</li>
<li>Add alternate text description (ALT tags) for any graphics, videos, animations, and other non-text elements on a web page Create meaningful title attributes</li>
<li>Use descriptive text for hypertext links, instead of &#8220;click here&#8221;</li>
<li>Caption or transcribe audio and video for the hearing-impaired (University Web Services recommends that YouTube be used for uploading videos. YouTube has a built-in closed caption feature that allows hearing impaired individuals to read words being spoken in the video)</li>
<li>Ensure that color contrast is adequate, especially between text and background color, and that color is not the only thing used to communicate important text</li>
<li>Ensure that all functions of the page can be accessed using the keyboard alone, including navigation Ensure tables are accessible</li>
<li>Form elements should make use of the label tag to properly associate the label and element Add skip to content links</li>
<li>Keep navigation consistent</li>
<li>If a page requires a plugin or applet, such as PDF, the page should provide a download link to the plugin Create accessible PDF files</li>
<li>Avoid flickering elements on a web page. They increase the risk of optically-induced seizures</li>
<li>When a timed response is required, be sure to alert the user, and allow sufficient time for the user to indicate more time is required</li>
</ul>
