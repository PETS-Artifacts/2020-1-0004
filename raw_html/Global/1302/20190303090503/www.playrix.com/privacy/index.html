          <a href="../eu_privacy/index.html">Privacy Notice</a> for the EU users of our software and our EU business partners and suppliers.
        </p>
        <p>We have created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to change this policy from time to time, so be sure to check it periodically.</p><br />
        <h3>Personal Information</h3>
        <p>All personal details that you provide to our website are absolutely safe, private, and secure. We respect the importance of information security and confidentiality, and do not disclose them to outside sources.</p>
        <p>We do not share your information with any third parties, with the exception of verified and secure e-commerce payment providers. When placing orders, our e-commerce provider handles your personal information and keeps it absolutely safe and secure—in fact, even we cannot access your credit card information. Your personal information (excluding credit card data) is shared with us only for administration purposes.</p>
        <p>You can always choose not to provide your personal details, though they might be needed to make a purchase or take advantage of some of Playrix.com's specific features.</p><br />
        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>Playrix collects personal information to improve the manner in which we operate and offer our products and services, communicate with you about those products and services, and provide effective, timely customer support when needed. We may collect the following information from our users:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>First name, last name, email address, billing address, and phone number</li>
          <li>For processing transactions, we also collect either credit card information or bank information, depending on your form of payment, though we do not store any credit card information once your transaction is complete</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We also collect Non-Personal Information, a term that refers to data that does not identify you. Such information can be related to the Games (including but not limited to your in-game score, how long you’ve been playing, and your in-game activities) or to the general use (including but not limited to internet protocol addresses, browser types, browser languages, referring and exit URLs, and number of clicks).</p>
        <p>We reserve the right to use all content generated by our users. By such content, we mean all content that users publish through the game and that is visible to other users (including but not limited to wall posts, sent messages, and other kinds of interaction with other players). Please note that Playrix does not guarantee the protection of any Personal Information posted in comments and/or on user walls. With that in mind, please double-check information before publishing it in the public domain. We are in no way responsible for how that information is used by other parties.</p>
        <p>Our website may use cookies to store information about your visits. While cookies contain no personal information, they help us identify you as a unique user and/or your browser session. Cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of Playrix.com’s best features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. In addition, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser while serving advertisements to this site. You can always turn cookies off in your browser settings.</p>
        <p>Personal and Non-Personal Information help us improve the quality of our products, services, and content, and/or technically manage our website or applications (including but not limited to logging your IP address to monitor traffic). We will never disclose your IP address to a third party.</p>
        <p>We may use your Personal Information to contact you as needed, including but not limited to by sending you notifications. If you do not want to receive further notifications from us, you can always disable this option.</p>
        <p>In the event that local law requires, and/or if we believe it will help avoid liability or fraud, and/or to comply with legal processes, we may disclose or access information about you, including but not limited to sharing information with the government and other companies. Playrix does not have to and will not question governmental requests and processes.</p><br />
        <h4><i>Special Note about Children</i></h4><br />
        <p>According to our Terms of Use, you must be at least 13 years old to access and/or use our website and software.</p>
        <p>We do not collect information about children under the age of 13. In the event any personal information was collected, we will delete it as soon as possible if you contact us at: <a href="mailto:contact@playrix.com">contact@playrix.com</a>.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend that minors aged 13-17 seek consent from a parent or legal guardian before accessing and/or using our website or Games and providing any private information.</p><br />

Playrix uses this information exclusively to send our regular newsletter about product updates, new releases, and special offers.

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>We have taken appropriate steps and followed industry standards to secure all personal data stored by our systems. All transactions are processed in keeping with the highest security level protocols, ensuring that no one can access or use personal information in an unauthorized manner.</p>
        <p>However, while we take responsible measures to protect your Personal Information, the internet is not a 100% secure environment. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of all information transmitted or electronically stored. We disclaim any liability for any unauthorized access to, disclosure or damage to, theft of, or loss of any Personal Information.
