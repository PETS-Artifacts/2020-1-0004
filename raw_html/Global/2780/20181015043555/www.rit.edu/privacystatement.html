  <h3>How do we protect your personal data?</h3>
  <p>RIT will maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in accordance with data protection requirements 
  to protect your personal data from unauthorized access or intrusion. These safeguards include implementing specific 
  technologies and procedures designed to protect your privacy, such as firewalls, access controls, vulnerability scanning, threat management,

  <a href="/academicaffairs/policiesmanual/c081">Information Security Policy</a> and <a href="/security/content/intro-policies-standards">Standards</a>.</p>
  <h3>With whom will we share your personal data?</h3>
  <p>We may share your personal data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>RIT subsidiaries and affiliates if and to the extent required for

  <h3>Your data protection rights</h3>
  <p>If you are an EU resident, you may request access to,
    rectification, erasure or restriction of processing of your personal data,
    subject to applicable EU law. You may also have the right to object to
    processing or request data portability and request a copy of the personal data
    that we hold about you. </p>
  <p>For any of the above requests, please send a description of
    your personal data stating your name, your date of birth and your place of
    birth as proof of identity to the contact details below. We may require
    additional proof of identity to protect your personal data against unauthorized

    can best be fulfilled.</p>
  <p>If you have given us your consent for the processing of your
    personal data you can withdraw the consent at any time with future effect, i.e.
    the withdrawal of the consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing
    based on the consent before its withdrawal. However, if you withdraw such
    consent, RIT may no longer be able to offer you all of the Services. In case
    consent is withdrawn, we may only further process the personal data where there
    is another legal ground for the processing.</p>
  <p>If you have any concerns about how your personal data is
    handled by us or wish to raise a complaint, you can contact us at the contact
    details below to have the matter investigated. If you are not satisfied with

    authority in your country. </p>
  <h3>Are you required to provide personal data?</h3>
  <p>As a general principle, you voluntarily provide us with your
    personal data. However, in certain circumstances we are required to collect
    certain personal data for legal purposes, for example because this personal
    data is required to be able to complete a contractual relationship, including
    your education or for other Services. In these cases, if you do not provide us
    with your personal information, we may be unable to provide you Services such
    as, but no limited to, administering your application/enrollment, assign
    certain tasks to you or permit you to participate in certain activities or
    services offered in connection with your studies or other interactions with RIT.</p>
  <h3>How long do we store personal data?</h3>
  <p>If you are an EU resident, RIT will delete your personal
    data when it is no longer reasonably required for business purposes or you
    withdraw your consent (where applicable), provided that we are not legally required
    or otherwise permitted to continue storing such data. RIT will not delete your
    personal data where it may be retained for the public interest, scientific or
    historical research purposes or statistical purposes. Please refer to our data
    retention policies for further details. </p>
