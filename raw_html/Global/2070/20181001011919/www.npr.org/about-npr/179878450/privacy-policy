In such cases, the information that we share may include your name, favorite stations, and listening activity. NPR prohibits the third-party developers of those applications from accessing, storing or sharing any such non-public information. However, please be aware that your use of the third-party application is otherwise subject to the third-party application's privacy policy, which we do not control and which may differ significantly from ours.

Bitly collects information as our shortened URLs are shared and clicked on, including IP addresses, general location information, the time and day each shortened URL is accessed, and the social media or other channels through which our content is shared. If you have established a separate account with Bitly, Bitly may associate the foregoing information with personal information it has stored in your Bitly account in accordance with Bitly's own <a href="https://bitly.com/pages/privacy">privacy policy</a>.

These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the information. Because no security system is impenetrable, however, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases or that information you supply will never be intercepted, accessed, or disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. Because most email and mobile transmissions are not encrypted, you should take special care in deciding what information you send to us via email, text messages, or other mobile transmissions.</p>   <p><strong>Links to and from Other Sites and Services</strong></p>   <p>Our Services contain links to other sites, applications, platforms and services operated by third parties whose privacy policies we don't control and may differ significantly from ours. For instance, clicking or tapping on a sponsorship credit or some third-party logos on the NPR Services will take you to an entirely different site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not. You also may access NPR content and the NPR Services from a third-party site or service that may collect, use and share information in ways that NPR would not. NPR is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of these third-party services and we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of any such sites or services you visit or access.</p>   <p><strong>Social Networking Services Sign-in and Sharing Tools</strong></p>   <p>Our Services allow users to sign in to their NPR accounts using their credentials on social networking services such as Facebook and Google+ (each an "SNS"). If you sign in to our Services through an SNS, we will receive your email address and certain profile information from such SNS in accordance with its privacy policy and your SNS account privacy settings. Any information that we collect from your SNS account may depend on the privacy settings you have selected with that SNS, so please consult the applicable SNS's privacy and data policies to learn how to manage these settings.</p>   <p>If you use tools on our Services that allow you to share stories or other content with your friends and followers on an SNS such as Facebook, Twitter, Flipboard, or Google+, that action and any information you share may be used by the SNS according to its own privacy policy.</p>   <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p>   <p>NPR reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be posted to this page, so please check back periodically. Your use of our Services constitutes consent to the Privacy Policy then in effect. Please read NPR's <a href="http://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> to understand additional terms and conditions that apply to your use of our Services.</p>   <p><strong>Users Outside the U.S.</strong></p>   <p>Our Services are controlled and operated within the United States. Any information we collect may be transferred to, and processed, stored, and accessed by, us and our service providers in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate. These jurisdictions may have data privacy laws that may not be as protective as those of your home jurisdiction, and courts and other authorities may, in certain circumstances, be entitled to access information about you subject to such data privacy laws. By using the NPR Services, you agree to this transfer, processing, storage, and access of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>   <p>NOTICE TO EU RESIDENTS: Our handling of information about EU residents is governed by the <a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/609131973/npr-privacy-notice-for-eu-residents">NPR Privacy Notice for EU Residents</a>, effective May 25, 2018. This Privacy Policy does not apply to EU residents.</p>   <p><strong>For California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights</strong></p>   <p>California residents can request and obtain from us once a year and free of charge a list of all third parties to which NPR has disclosed certain information during the preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and want such a list, please <a href="https://help.npr.org/customer/portal/emails/new?i=5&s=NPR%20Management">contact us</a>. For all requests, you must put the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in the message field of your request, as well as your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Please note that we will not accept these requests by telephone, mail or fax, and we are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or that do not have complete information.</p>   <div class="hr"><hr></div>
