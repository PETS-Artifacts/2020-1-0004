				<p>
				Linode LLC ("Linode," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is
				committed to protecting the Personal Data it collects. The purpose of this
				Privacy Policy is to inform you of how we protect your privacy when accessing or
				using Linode Resources.
				</p>

				<h4>General Terms and Privacy Shield Notice</h4>

				<p>
				<span class="legal-subheader">Scope</span><br/>
				This Privacy Policy applies to Linode Resources that link to, or reference, this
				Privacy Policy, and describes the ways Linode collects and uses your personal
				information and the choices you have regarding collection, use, maintenance,
				access and transmission of your personal information. Capitalized terms not
				expressly defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning found in the
				Customer Agreement. By utilizing a Linode Resource, including without limitation
				the Linode Services, Linode's website or otherwise providing your Personal Data
				to Linode via any other means, you or the entity you represent ("you" or "your")
				accept and consent to the rights, obligations and practices described in this
				Privacy Policy.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="legal-subheader">Privacy Shield and Cross-Border Transfers of Personal Data</span><br/>
				Linode is an international organization headquartered in the United States of America
				(the “US”). By utilizing a Linode Resource, you expressly consent to Linode’s access,
				maintenance, transmission and/or use of your Personal Data outside of your country of
				residence, regardless of location or jurisdiction. 
				</p>

				<p>
				This means that your use of a Linode Resource may result (i) in your Personal Data being
				stored and/or processed in any country that Linode, our affiliates or our subprocessors
				maintain facilities, and (ii) that while in such jurisdictions, your Personal Data may be
				subject to access pursuant to the laws of those jurisdictions (which may be more or less
				comprehensive as the laws of your country). To obtain a list of Linode’s affiliates and
				subprocessors, please email <a href="mailto:support@linode.com">support@linode.com</a>.
				</p>

				<p>
				In addition to our obligations under US law, Linode supplements the protection of the
				international transfer of your Personal Data in the following ways:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
					EU-US Privacy Shield. The European Union – US Privacy Shield Framework (“EU-US Privacy
					Shield”) is an international agreement between the European Union (“EU”) and the US
					regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from
					the European Economic Area to US data processors. The EU-US Privacy Shield is administered
					by the United States Department of Commerce and governed by the EU-US Privacy Shield
					Principles. Linode participates and complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield and agrees
					that all cross-border transfers of Personal Data from/to the European Economic Area are
					subject to the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles. As a participant of the EU-US Privacy
					Shield, Linode is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the US Federal Trade
					Commission, and in some instances, may be required to disclose Personal Data to lawful
					requests by public authorities.	In the event of a conflict between the terms in this
					Privacy Policy and the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles, the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles
					shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield and to view Linode’s EU-US Privacy
					Shield certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
					</li><br>
					<li>
					Swiss-US Privacy Shield. The Switzerland – US Privacy Shield Framework (“Swiss-US Privacy
					Shield”) is an international agreement between Switzerland and the US regarding the
					collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from Switzerland to
					US data processors. The Swiss-US Privacy Shield is administered by the United States Department
					of Commerce and governed by the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. Linode participates and
					complies with the Swiss-US Privacy Shield and agrees that all cross-border transfers of Personal
					Data from/to Switzerland are subject to the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles. As a participant
					of the EU-US Privacy Shield, Linode is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the US
					Federal Trade Commission, and in some instances, may be required to disclose Personal Data to
					lawful requests by public authorities. In the event of a conflict between the terms in this Privacy
					Policy and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles, the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Principles shall
					govern. To learn more about the Privacy	Shield and to view Linode’s Swiss-US Privacy Shield
					certification, please visit <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
				<span class="legal-subheader">Third Party Transfers of Data</span><br/>
				Linode may transfer Personal Data to third parties acting on our behalf when operationally necessary
				to provide the Services. If Linode has received your Personal Data in the US or the EU and subsequently
				transfers your Personal Data to a third party acting on our behalf, and such third-party agent processes
				your Personal Data in a manner that is inconsistent with the applicable Privacy Shield Principles,
				Linode will remain responsible and liable unless we can prove that Linode is not responsible for the
				event giving rise to the damage.
				</p>

				<p>
				<span class="legal-subheader">Dispute Resolution</span><br/>
				Please direct any complaints regarding this Privacy Policy to us at <a href="mailto:privacy@linode.com">privacy@linode.com</a>,

				the time and duration of the pages on Linode's website that you view (where
				applicable) and information about your computer system, such as your browser

				Personal Data provided by you in your Account, including without limitation,
				your full name, Linode identification number, billing data and contact
				information.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode also collects anonymous usage information on Visitors to its website
				through use of <a href="https://analytics.google.com">Google Analytics</a>.
				Google Analytics may employ third party tracking cookies to gather anonymous
				browser, operating system, geographic, and website navigation information. Use
				of the Linode Manager interface requires the acceptance of cookies for login
				session management purposes.
				</p>
				<p>
				Linode will likely place a cookie on your hard drive during the web visit. A
				cookie is a unique alphanumeric identifier that Linode uses to determine the
				number of unique Visitors that view its website, whether or not those Visitors
				are repeat Visitors, and the source of the visits. Cookies cannot be executed as
				code or used to deliver a virus. Other servers cannot read cookies and personal
				information cannot be gathered from cookies. Cookies are simply an identifier
				shared between you and Linode to allow Linode to improve the services Linode

				website, which is invisible to you. When you view a page on Linode's website, an
				e-mail or an advertisement, your web browser will request the web beacon from a

				effectiveness of content and advertising campaigns.

				industry efforts to control fraud, spam or other undesirable conduct. In the event of a
				Customer request for the disclosure of Personal Data by Linode, Customer will be responsible

				house personal information, browser-based secure sockets layer encryption, and
				other storage system access control mechanisms to protect the integrity of
				internal databases and prevent unauthorized access.

				officials), in which case personal information may be retained indefinitely for
				purposes of ongoing investigation and prevention of fraud recurrence, or cases
				where a violation of the Customer Agreement and applicable Service Level
				Agreement has resulted in cancellation of your account (as defined by revocation
