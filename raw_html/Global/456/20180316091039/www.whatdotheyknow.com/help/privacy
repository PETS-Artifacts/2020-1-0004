      <p>
        We will not disclose your email address to anyone unless we are obliged
        to by law, or you ask us to. This includes the public authority that you
        are sending a request to. The system automatically generates a
        @whatdotheyknow.com email address which is specific to each request —
        your message will have this address in the ‘from’ line and it’s also the
        address that responses are sent to. Our system alerts you, via the
        personal email address you have provided when creating your request, to
        let you know there is a response: this too is an automated process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Site administrators may get to see your email address in the process of
        administering the site, and may use your email address to contact you
        about your use of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you send a message to another user on the site,
        then it will reveal your email address to them. You’ll see an alert to
        warn you of this before you submit your message.

    <dd>
      <p>
        No. After you sign up to WhatDoTheyKnow we will only send you emails
        relating to a request you made, an email alert that you have signed up
        for, or for other reasons that you specifically authorise. We will never
        give or sell your email addresses to anyone else, unless we are obliged
        to by law, or you ask us to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Site administrators may see users’ email addresses and may contact you
        about your use of the site. We also occasionally contact users who have
        made a particularly interesting request, as we like to write about these
        on the mySociety blog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other users may also contact you via the ‘send this user an email’
        function. Abuse of this service is not common and you can report any
        messages which you consider abusive to us via the <a href="/help/contact">Contact Us</a> form. Upon consideration, we may
        then suspend users who have abused this service.

    <dd>
      <p>
        Your name is an integral part tangled up with your request, so has to be
        published with it. It is only fair, as we are also going to publish the
        name of the civil servant who writes the response to your request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using your real name also helps people get in touch with you to assist
        you with your research or to campaign with you.
      </p>
      <p>
        But perhaps most importantly, it means that our users think twice before
        making a request: if you know that your name will be permanently
        attached to it for all to see, then you are far more likely to make a
        responsible, valid and useful request.
      </p>
      <p>
        By law, you must use your real name for the request to be a valid
        Freedom of Information request — but see the next question for
        alternatives if you do not want to publish your full name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your requests will be grouped together and appear on your profile on the
        site.

      <p>
        Technically, you must use your real name for your request to be a valid
        Freedom of Information request in law. See this
        <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/guidance_index/~/media/documents/library/Freedom_of_Information/Detailed_specialist_guides/MOTIVE_BLIND_V1.ashx">
        guidance from the Information Commissioner</a> (October 2007).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the same guidance also says it is good practice for the public
        authority to still consider a request made using an obvious pseudonym.
        You should refer to this if a public authority refuses a request because
        you used a pseudonym.
      </p>
      <p>
        Be careful though, even if the authority follows this good practice, the
        pseudonym will probably make it impossible for you to complain to the
        Information Commissioner later about the handling of your request.
      </p>
      <p>There are several good alternatives to using a pseudonym.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use a different form of your name. The guidance says
          that “Mr Arthur Thomas Roberts” can make a valid request as “Arthur
          Roberts”, “A. T. Roberts”, or “Mr Roberts”, but <strong>not</strong> as
          “Arthur” or “A.T.R.”.
        </li>
        <li>
          Women may use their maiden name.
        </li>
        <li>
          In most cases, you may use any name by which you are “widely known and/or
          is regularly used”.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the name of an organisation, the name of a company, the trading name
          of a company, or the trading name of a sole trader.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ask someone else to make the request on your behalf.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may, if you are really stuck, ask us to make the request on
          your behalf. Please <a href="/help/contact">contact us</a> with
          a good reason why you cannot make the request yourself and cannot
          ask a friend to. Do not impersonate someone else. This is an abuse of
          our terms of service - read more in our <a href="/help/house_rules">House Rules</a>.

      Why are there anonymous requests on the site?
      <a href="#anonymous">#</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Historically, some public authorities used mySociety’s <a
        href="https://github.com/mysociety/foi-register">FOI Register</a>
        software (which has since been discontinued) in order to use
        WhatDoTheyKnow as a disclosure log for all their FOI activity. When
        people made requests to the authority their names were usually withheld
        from publication just as they would in an authority disclosure log on an
        authority website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, for various reasons including proven endangerment to the
        individual, we will remove a user’s name from the site; when we do so we
        make this clear; typically by replacing the name with “[name removed]”.

      <p>
        If a public authority asks you for your full, physical address, reply to
        them saying that section 8.1.b of the FOI Act asks for an "address for
        correspondence", and that the email address you are using is sufficient.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The Ministry of Justice has guidance on this&ndash;
          <em>“As well as hard copy written correspondence, requests that are
          transmitted electronically (for example, in emails) are acceptable
          ... If a request is received by email and no postal address is given,
          the email address should be treated as the return address.”

         The Information Commissioner’s <a href="http://www.ico.org.uk/for_organisations/freedom_of_information/guide/receiving_a_request">
          Hints for Practitioners</a> say <em>“A request must ...
          include an address for correspondence. This need not be the person’s
          residential or work address - it can be <strong>any address at which
          you can write to them</strong>, including a postal address or
          <strong>email address</strong>;”</em>

          Commissioner’s Guidance on recognising a request</a> under the Freedom

          <a href="/">WhatDoTheyKnow</a> which states:

          <blockquote>
            With respect to the address for correspondence, we consider the
            <code>@whatdotheyknow.com</code> email address provided to
            authorities when requests are made through the site to be a valid
            contact address for the purposes of Section 8(1)(b).
          </blockquote>
        </li>
      </ul>

      The authority have asked for  a postal address to send a paper response
      <a href="#postal_answer">#</a>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        If an authority only has a paper copy of the information that you
        want, they may ask you for a postal address. Naturally, since one of
        the principles of WhatDoTheyKnow is that, by sharing responses to FOI
        requests, we are providing resources for everyone to use, we prefer
        that they provide the information by email.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you might try persuading them to scan in the documents for you.
        You can even <a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/car_parking_charges_policy_and_a#outgoing-532">offer to gift them a
        scanner</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn’t work, and you want to provide your postal address
        privately in order to receive the documents, mark your request as
        “They are going to reply by post”, and it will give you an email
        address to use for that purpose.

        Support mail is handled by the WhatDoTheyKnow volunteer admin team via a

        security protocols.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Retention period</strong> We retain emails sent to and from this
        central mailbox for two years — correspondence is automatically and
        permanently deleted after that point, although any email that needs to
        be kept on file for specific legal reasons, such as in-progress police
        investigations or lawsuits, is retained separately. Misdirected mail of
        a sensitive nature, such as a request for help with personal
        circumstances, is kept for a shorter period of thirty days.

        <strong>Sometimes public bodies accidentally release personal data in
        bulk. WhatDoTheyKnow does not want to hold this information longer than
        necessary and treats it with due care.</strong> Volunteers will only
        download from WhatDoTheyKnow whatever information is necessary to handle
        a suspected breach of the Data Protection Act by an authority,
        encrypting the data using a strong algorithm, protecting their device
        with a strong password, and deleting the data as soon as possible and in
        all circumstances within four hours. If the data needs to be retained
        after that period, it is kept on mySociety’s servers and mySociety is
        responsible for holding and deleting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        For material that needs to be retained for a relatively short period
        e.g. where we give the ICO two weeks to request the material from us
        before we delete it, the material will remain hidden on WhatDoTheyKnow
        and will be deleted at the end of the retention period. In the rare case
        where a longer retention period is necessary, mySociety staff are
        responsible for moving the material to non-web accessible storage on
        mySociety’s servers and deleting it when the retention period is
        complete.

        Sometimes we will want to send a copy of sensitive material to the

        sensitive personal information we do this by encrypting the data with an
        AES algorithm using at least a 256bit key. The encrypted data will be
        sent by email or made available for download via the web, FTP, USB and
        the decryption password is provided via a separate channel.

        WhatDoTheyKnow, as well as providing a service by which you can easily

        Even though you may not find the response to a request useful any more,
        it may be of interest to others. For this reason, we will not

          We are happy try to assist FOI officers who want us to help them
          remove their signatures from the website, but generally in such
          circumstances we require replacement responses to be prepared and sent
          to the requester before we will remove the original documents.
          We are unable to edit attachments which have been released via our
          service.

        We are also of course subject to the law and obliged to
        consider requests from anyone who considers our publication of their
        personal information is, or is likely to, cause them unwarranted harm
        or distress. (See <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/section/10">
