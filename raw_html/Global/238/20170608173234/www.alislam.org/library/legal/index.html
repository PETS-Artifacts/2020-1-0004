This Privacy Policy applies to this site, which is owned and operated by the AMC. You can visit most of our sites without providing any personal information. When personal information is requested, we adhere to the following privacy principles regarding how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your information.</p>
<h2><span id="privacy_practices">Privacy Practices</span></h2>
<p>Information Collection. When you access our website we may collect information your Internet device or web browser sends whenever you visit one of our sites, including an Internet Protocol (IP) address.</p>
<h2><span id="use_of_personal_information">Use of Personal Information</span></h2>
<p>We may use the personal information you provide to (a) allow us to contact you, (b) fulfill requests you make, (c) or, seek your voluntary feedback on website features or content.</p>
<p>We may also use your personal information for internal purposes, including auditing, data analysis, system troubleshooting, and research. In addition, we may use both the personal information you provided and the information your web browser sends to detect users who appear to be causing harm to our sites or to personalize users’ experiences on our sites. If your information will be used for any purpose besides those outlined above, we will specifically inform you and obtain your consent, if legally required. From time to time, we may also make you aware of options to opt out of using or opt in to use certain features.</p>
<h2><span id="retention">Retention</span></h2>
<p>We retain collected personal information and submissions for a reasonable period of time to fulfill the collection purpose and then delete it from our records.</p>
<h2><span id="information_sharing_and_disclosure">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span></h2>
<p>We regard your personal information as confidential and do not sell it to anyone. We do not share your personal information with other parties with the exception of legal requirements. Accordingly, we may access and disclose your personal information, posts, journal entries, online chats, personal notes, content, or other submissions to any website if we have a good-faith belief that doing so is required by a subpoena or other judicial or administrative order or otherwise required by law. Additionally, we may disclose your personal information and other information where we, in good faith, deem it appropriate or necessary to prevent a violation of our other agreements; to take precautions against liability; to protect the rights, property, or safety of the site, of any individual, or of the general public; to maintain and protect the security and integrity of our services or infrastructure; to protect ourselves and our services from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations; or to assist government law enforcement agencies.</p>
<h2><span id="protection_of_information">Protection of Information</span></h2>
<p>We use technical and organizational measures to protect the personal information we receive against loss, misuse, and unauthorized alteration and to protect its confidentiality. We periodically review our security procedures and consider appropriate new security technology and methods.

<h2><span id="passive_data_collection">Passive Data Collection</span></h2>
<p><strong> </strong>Tracking Technologies, Cookies, and Clear GIFs. When you visit any of our sites, our servers or filtering systems may collect information that your web browser sends any time you visit a website. This information may include but is not limited to your browser type, your operating system, your language preference, any referring web page you were visiting before you came to our site, the date and time of each visitor request, and information you search for on our sites.</p>
<p>We also use cookies and clear GIFs to collect information. A <em>cookie</em> is a small bit of data used to transfer information to either your computer’s hard drive or your web browser for record-keeping purposes. A cookie serves as a sort of label that allows our sites to recognize your web browser when you return to our sites.  A <em>clear GIF</em> (also known as a <em>web beacon</em>) is used in combination with cookies to help us understand how visitors interact with our sites. A clear GIF is typically a transparent graphic image placed on a website. The use of clear GIFs allows us to monitor your actions when you open a web page and makes it easier for us to follow and record the activities of recognized browsers. For example, using clear GIFs, we can track the path of page visits on a website and monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our sites. We collect this information to better understand how you use and interact with our sites in order to improve your experience. We may also share this information with our employees, contractors, service providers, and affiliated entities.</p>
<p>You can change your web browser settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the sites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use some sections or functions of our sites.  We take privacy seriously and strive to comply with all local, state, and federal privacy laws. If you have any questions you can contact us at legal@alislam.org.</p>

Any of our sites that collect children’s information will do so only with the prior express and informed consent of the child’s parent or guardian in compliance with applicable law. We strongly recommend that minors under the age of 18 ask their parents for permission before sending any personal information to anyone over the Internet, and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe Internet use practices.</p>
<h2><span id="third-party_links">Third-Party Links</span></h2>
