        <h1>Songkick Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>
            <em>For the purpose of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act), the data controller is Songkick.com Limited (company registration number 06265278) of 12-18 Hoxton Street, Third floor, London N1 6NG.</em>
          </p>
          <p><em>TO OUR COMMUNITY: If this sort of thing interests you, we would like your feedback on this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service. Feel free to email us directly (<a href="mailto:support@songkick.com">support@songkick.com</a>) with any questions, criticisms, and suggestions.</em></p>
  
          <p>Songkick knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting the www.songkick.com website and domain name (collectively, the &ldquo;Website&rdquo;), and/or using any other linked pages, features, content, or application services offered from time to time by Songkick in connection therewith (collectively the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  
          <h2>1. What does this privacy policy cover?</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy covers Songkick’s treatment of personally identifiable information (&ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;) that Songkick gathers when you access the Website and/or use some other features of the Service. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Songkick does not own or control, or to individuals that Songkick does not employ or manage.</p>
  
          <h2>2. What personal information does Songkick collect?</h2>
          <p>The information we gather enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users:</p>
          <h3>i. Personal information you provide to us</h3>
          <p>We receive and store any information you enter on the Website or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected include your full name, email address, IP address, browser information, username, password and any other information necessary for us to provide the Service, including the usernames and passwords for your accounts and profiles on third-party sites with which the Service interoperates. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as answering questions, sending product updates, and communicating with you about Songkick’s products and services, including specials and new features.</p>
          <h3>ii. Personal Information collected automatically</h3>
          <p>a. We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Website or use another feature of our Service. Songkick automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested.</p>
          <p>b. More generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Website and its components, or user music preference data, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. Songkick only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the Website or another feature of the Service so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible, and improve the Service. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our Service. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our Service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience. Again, Songkick never discloses aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally.</p>
          <h3>iii. E-mail communications</h3>
          <p>We often receive a confirmation when you open an email from Songkick if your computer supports this type of program. Songkick uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers.</p>
          <h3>iv. The Songkicker</h3>
          <p>The Service includes a software component known as the Songkicker which enables Songkick to capture your musical tastes as demonstrated by the music you keep and listen to in your digital music collection. If you do install the Songkicker, it and the data it captures will operate and will be used by Songkick as follows:</p>
          <p>a. the Songkicker will be sending your music listening data (including a list of all songs and playlists in your digital music library) to the Songkick secure servers to be saved by Songkick in our databases</p>
          <p>b. your music listening data is also used to generate concert recommendations, as well as being used by Songkick to improve the Service for all Users, within the limits set by this Policy</p>
  
          <h2>3. What about cookies?</h2>
          <p>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. We use cookies to enhance visitors. experiences, to learn more about their use of the Website and to improve quality.</p>
          <p>Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of the Website’s most attractive features.</p>
          <p>Ads appearing on the Website or in other features of the Service may be delivered to users by our advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Songkick and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
  
          <h2>4. Will Songkick share any of the personal information it receives?</h2>
