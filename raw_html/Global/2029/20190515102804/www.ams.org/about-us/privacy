<ul>
  <li>IP address of computer</li>
  <li>Browser-related information</li>
  <li>Locations visited on the website</li>
  <li>HTTP cookies</li>
</ul>
<h4>IP Address</h4>
<p> An IP address may be considered personal information in certain countries, including the EEA (defined below).

  <li>To analyze trends.</li>
</ol>
<p>Where applicable, we may disclose your personal information to any affiliated business entities or third parties who use your personal information to provide services to us. This includes third parties involved in the administration and operation of our services. We may also disclose your personal information to other third parties, such as:</p>

<p>Where required, processing performed by anyone other than AMS will be governed by a data processing agreement in the form required by law, preserving any and all of your statutory data protection rights.</p>
<h3>Email</h3>
<p> The AMS does not sell, trade or rent e-mail addresses to other organizations, or use or disclose them for marketing purposes, except as described below. Certain e-mail addresses may be published in both print and electronic AMS publications including the AMS website. The AMS may generate e-mail for the following types of communication:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Notification e-mail to which the individual may subscribe and unsubscribe.</li>
  <li>Transactional e-mail, which is the result of a business transaction initiated with the AMS.</li>
  <li>Relationship e-mail, which is sent as an informational service because of a relationship with the AMS.</li>
  <li>Commercial e-mail, which is sent to promote an AMS product or service (You may opt not to receive this type of e-mail).</li>
  <li>Correspondence from AMS staff as a result of a communication initiated by a member or customer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Email that has a provision for opt-out will include instructions on how to do so. All inquiries regarding subscription-based e-mails should be directed to the AMS Sales and Member Services department (see AMS contact information below).</p>
<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
<p> Postal mailing lists, comprised of full name and postal address, may be rented to other organizations (e.g. professional societies and/or commercial publishers) for one-time promotional or informational use. Promotional or informational materials are subject to AMS approval prior to the rental. E-mail addresses are not included in mailing lists.<br>
  The AMS may occasionally send informational or promotional materials to members and customers. You may choose to exclude yourself from all, none, or only non-AMS mailings by contacting the Sales and Member Services department (see AMS contact information below) or by changing your privacy preferences in your AMS account.</p>
<h2>Security</h2>
<p> To secure your information, we have put in place commercially suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on our website.</p>
<p>Specifically, for those accessing our website from the EEA and North America, (i) the AMS website resides behind a firewall uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer, the industry-standard security protocol used to communicate with browsers) to transmit personal information; (ii) data is strongly encrypted during transmission to so that personal and payment information is secure; (iii) industry-standard data encryption techniques are used to protect personal information on AMS computers; and (iv) SSL-capable browsers typically have a symbol on the browser window to indicate when they are in a secure mode. In addition, the URL will begin with "https:" for all browsers. Access may be different if a user is accessing from a country outside the EEA and North America.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically on our website, and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.</p>
<h2>Social Security Numbers</h2>
<p> We take commercially reasonable security measures in regards to our collection, storage, and disposal of Social Security numbers. We regularly review our physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to so that they protect the confidentiality and prohibit unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers. We limit access to Social Security numbers to only those persons with a legitimate business purpose.</p>

<p>Several public forums are hosted on the AMS website. The inherent public nature of these forums dictates that the AMS assumes no responsibility for protecting the information disclosed on them by users. Please exercise caution when disclosing personal information in public forums.</p>
<h2>Transfer / use of information outside the European Economic Area</h2>
<p> Since the AMS operates globally, AMS may collect or receive information from individuals in Switzerland or the European Economic Area ("EEA"), which currently comprises the member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>AMS is committed to having a lawful basis for data transfers from the EEA and Switzerland to the US in compliance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>For some contracted services, we use the European Commission's ("EC") standard contractual clauses commonly known as "model clauses." These model clauses are contract templates developed by the EC as a mechanism for contracting parties to legalize the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland.</p>
<p>Please note that the model clauses will apply to the extent there is not another legal basis in place to validate the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S.</p>
<p>To learn more about the EC's model clauses, please visit http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/transfer/index_en.htm.</p>
<p>AMS has further committed to refer unresolved complaints to JAMS Mediation and Arbitrators ("JAMS"), an alternative dispute resolution provider located in the U.S. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not addressed your complaint to your satisfaction, please contact or visit https://www.jamsadr.com for more information or to file a complaint. The services of JAMS are provided at no cost to you.</p>
<h2>Users Only of Legal Age of Majority</h2>
<p> Our website is designed and intended for those who have reached the age of majority (18 years of age). By using our website, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age or older. We are not liable for any damages that may result from a user's misrepresentation of age.</p>
<p>No one under age 13 is authorized to submit or post any information, including personally identifying information, on our website. Under no circumstances may anyone under age 13 use our website. Parents or legal guardians of children under 13 cannot agree to these terms on their behalf.</p>
<h2>Your Rights Regarding your Personal Information</h2>
<p> You have the right to access the personal information that is held about you by the AMS.<br>
  You also have the right to ask us to correct any inaccurate personal information we hold about you, to delete personal information, or otherwise restrict our processing, or to object to processing or to receive an electronic copy of the personal information you provided to us.</p>
<p> Please note that should you decide to provide us with your personal information and agree to have it published, you may request that we alter or delete your personal information prior to publication, but once a work is published in print or on our website, your personal information may not be altered or deleted. Additionally, your personal information may be re-released by others who have accessed your works, and is therefore no longer under control of the AMS and therefore cannot be altered or deleted.</p>
