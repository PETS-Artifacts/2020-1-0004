                technology, services, and hosted websites to third parties. This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices
                for all OverDrive-hosted websites, software, technologies, services, support services, applications including
                Libby and the OverDrive app, and OverDrive accounts (collectively referred to as "Services").</p>
            <p>OverDrive respects your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to make you aware of how OverDrive collects,
                manages, protects, uses, and/or shares information and what choices are available to you regarding the collection,
                use and distribution of your Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information ("non-PII").</p>
            <p>Many users under the age of 13 enjoy using the Services. To see OverDrive's policy regarding the collection of

            <h2>What is Personal Information and non-PII?</h2>
            <p>"Personal Information" is information that can be used on its own to identify a specific person.  For example,
                Personal Information can be a full name, home address, email address, phone number, or login details.  OverDrive
                does not collect your Personal Information unless you choose to submit it to OverDrive.</p>

            <p>In most cases, non-personally identifiable information or "non-PII" is data that cannot be used on its own to identify a specific person.
                For example, non-PII can be an IP address, device ID, or geolocation information.  <a href="#what-non-pii-does-overdrive-collect">OverDrive collects and stores certain non-PII</a>
                related to your interactions and use of our Services.</p>

            <p>Non-PII is treated by OverDrive as Personal Information when it's collected on an individual level <i>and</i> linked to the
                Personal Information that you have chosen to submit to OverDrive.</p>


            <h2>Do I need to provide Personal Information to OverDrive in order to use the Services?</h2>
            <p>No, you can use most Services without providing any Personal Information to OverDrive. A valid library card or school
                ID is all you need to use most Services.  As part of your interaction with the Services, you may willingly submit your
                Personal Information in order to access certain features, such as placing a hold on a digital content title.</p>
            <p>An OverDrive account is not required to use most library Services.  If you choose to create an OverDrive account,
                you will be required to submit Personal Information to OverDrive. Please <a href="#what-is-required-to-create-an-overdrive-account">click here</a> to visit the section of this
                Privacy Policy that applies specifically to your OverDrive account.</p>
            <p>If you have created an OverDrive account, you may use Facebook login as an option to sign into your OverDrive account.
                OverDrive does not send any Personal Information or non-PII to Facebook. </p>

            <h2>How Does OverDrive Protect my Personal Information? </h2>
            <p>OverDrive takes information security very seriously. We have implemented measures to protect against the loss, misuse,
                and alteration of your Personal Information. Any Personal Information is protected by physical, electronic, and procedural
                safeguards to prevent unauthorized disclosure. We encrypt the transmission of Personal Information using secure sockets layer
                (SSL) technology. We use computer safeguards such as firewalls and data encryption and physical access controls to our
                buildings and files. We authorize access to Personal Information only for those employees who require it to fulfill their
                job responsibilities.</p>

            <h2 id="what-non-pii-does-overdrive-collect">What non-PII does OverDrive collect?</h2>
            <p>We collect and store certain information related to your interactions and use of our Services, including but not limited to, IP address, device type, device ID, operating system, library card number, Adobe ID, library name, lending history, holds, reading progress, and online activity.  If you have chosen to submit your Personal Information to OverDrive, any such non-PII may be linked to your Personal Information and will be treated by OverDrive as Personal Information. </p>

            <p>Some Services provide the ability for you to see your lending history. If you are using your institutionâ€™s OverDrive-hosted website, Libby, or the OverDrive app, you will have the option to show your lending history. You can hide your lending history by following the instructions within the app or help articles.  Your lending history is protected by OverDrive as confidential. It is not shared with any third parties, except to staff with appropriate authority acting within the scope of their duties for the administration of your institution (library, school, etc.).  If we are compelled to disclose your lending history pursuant to a court order or subpoena, or to a person or agency with the relevant administrative or legislative investigative power, we will seek to challenge and limit the scope and comply with the authorized agency or person only as required by law.

            <h2>Does OverDrive use cookies and similar technologies?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, we use cookies and similar technologies to collect and store certain information when you use, access,
                or interact with the Services. Cookies are small data file identifiers that are transferred to your device

            </ul>
            <p>OverDrive never sells your Personal Information or non-PII.  If you provide Personal Information to us, such as your email address for notification of library hold availability, OverDrive will not use your Personal Information for any other purposes than the specified use. Email addresses submitted to OverDrive for holds notifications are stored by OverDrive so you can place future holds in a quicker, more convenient manner.</p>
            <p>OverDrive may use and share non-PII with third parties in order to analyze Service usage, improve the Service, or for other
                similar purposes. The non-PII shared with third parties is disassociated with any Personal Information such that it is anonymous
                and cannot be used to identify you.  Additionally, we may anonymize Personal Information and share it in an aggregated form with
                third parties in order to analyze Service usage, improve the Service, or for other similar purposes. The use and disclosure of
                such anonymous information is not subject to any restrictions under this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h2>How long is information retained by OverDrive?</h2>
            <p>We retain information for as long as OverDrive deems necessary to provide the Services or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.
            </p>
            <h2>What if I share Information with others while using the Services? </h2>
            <p>While using our Services, you may enjoy opportunities to post reviews, rate digital content, and share digital
                content information with others in public forums and on social networking websites such as Facebook, Twitter,
                and Goodreads. When you share such information, it is made public and is not subject to this Privacy Policy.
                We are not responsible for any third party's use of information you publicly display or disclose through
                our Services.</p>
            <h2>How can I change my preferences? </h2>

            <h2>What happens when I visit an external website not related to OverDrive's Services? </h2>
            <p>Our Services may include links to non-OverDrive websites, outside the control of OverDrive. If you click these
                links, you will leave OverDrive and enter websites that may have different privacy policies than OverDrive.
                OverDrive is not responsible for the information handling practices of these other websites. These linked
                websites have separate and independent privacy statements, notices and terms of use, which we recommend you
                read carefully.</p>
            <h2>Is my information transmitted to other countries? </h2>
            <p>Given that the Internet is a global environment, using the Internet to collect and process information necessarily
                involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by using the Services, you acknowledge
                and consent to the transfer of your information outside your country of residence to any country where we
                have facilities or engage third parties (including but not limited to, payment processors, cloud service
                or other Information Technology providers, and other companies that provide services to us). If you are visiting the Services from the EU,

                You understand that the countries to which we may transfer information may not have as comprehensive a level of data protection
                as in your country.  OverDrive requires that third parties (if any), such as cloud service providers, with whom
                information about users of school Services is shared are obligated to safeguard such information using policies
                and procedures that are consistent with this Privacy Policy and must only use the information in order to perform
                the authorized school or educational purpose for which it was provided.</p>

            <h2>What if I contact OverDrive for a support issue? </h2>
            <p>If you contact OverDrive directly for assistance resolving an issue with the Services, it may be necessary for
                OverDrive to use support tools to resolve your issue. For a limited number of issues, these tools may provide
                OverDrive support personnel with visibility of your borrowing information while your support case is being
                resolved.<br />

            <h2 id="what-is-required-to-create-an-overdrive-account"><a name="createAccount"></a>What is required to create an OverDrive account?</h2>
            <p>Your name, email address, and password are required to create an OverDrive account. By creating and using an OverDrive account and/or otherwise consenting to the sharing of information with us, you authorize OverDrive to collect and retain the Personal Information submitted by you. You also affirm that you are at least 13 years of age and acknowledge that an OverDrive account is not intended for use by individuals under 13 years of age. You may not share your information regarding your OverDrive account, including but not limited to your login credentials such as your password.</p>

            <h2><a name="whatisglc"></a>What is OverDrive's Instant Digital Card service?</h2>
            <p>OverDrive's Instant Digital Card online service ("IDC") helps users obtain access to the library's OverDrive digital collection.
                Only authorized patrons of the library are permitted to access and checkout digital content from the library's digital collection</p>
            <p>You must be at least 13 years old to use IDC.  If you use IDC, you will be asked to submit your name, mobile phone number, and email
                address to OverDrive.  Only U.S. mobile phone numbers are eligible for use with IDC.  Your name and mobile phone number  will be used
                to confirm your mobile phone number is associated with you and to verify that you have an address in your library's service area.
                Libraries that participate in IDC provide OverDrive with the zip codes that comprise their service area.  Submitting your name, mobile
                phone number, and email address to IDC confirms your consent to this Privacy Policy and OverDrive's
                <a class="od-policy" href="./terms-and-conditions.htm">Terms and Conditions.</a></p>
            <p>To verify that your address is in your library's service area, OverDrive will share your name and mobile phone number with a third-party verification service,
                <a target="_blank" href="https://cognitohq.com">Cognito.</a>
                Cognito will use your name and mobile phone number to return an address, if any, to OverDrive.</p>
            <p>Cognito does not use your name or mobile phone number for marketing or sales purposes, nor do they share your name or mobile phone number with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.</p>
            <p>OverDrive will send a text message to the mobile phone number you provide (standard text message rates apply)
                to verify the mobile phone number's association with you.</p>
            <p>If you are validated as having a residential address within your libraryâ€™s service area, you will be able to access and checkout digital content from your libraryâ€™s OverDrive digital collection.  Your name, mobile phone number, and address are stored by OverDrive for the purpose of authenticating your checkouts from the libraryâ€™s OverDrive digital collection.  Unless otherwise permitted through your opt-in consent to receive marketing communications, OverDrive does not use your name or mobile phone number for marketing or sales purposes, nor do we share your name or mobile phone number with third parties for marketing or sales purposes.</p>
            <p>In addition to obtaining checkout privileges to your library's digital collection, you may also be eligible for a library card for access to your library's
                additional resources (e.g. physical book and media borrowing).  Through the validation process, OverDrive will store your address for the purpose of
                providing your name, address, email address, and mobile phone number to your library, where you may be eligible for a library card for access to additional
                library resources.  Your use of IDC confirms your consent to OverDrive providing your name, address, email address, and mobile phone number with your
                library, and confirms your consent to be contacted by your library, if necessary.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or concerns regarding IDC, please contact OverDrive via email at <a href="mailto:privacy@overdrive.com">privacy@overdrive.com</a>.</p>
