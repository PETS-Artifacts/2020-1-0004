        <p class="legal-bold">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </p>
        <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT CHESS.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES,
          AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL,
          EQUIPMENT DOWNTIME, OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EVEN
          IF CHESS.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RELATING TO CHESS.COM, THE SERVICE OR ANY
          CONTENT APPEARING ON OR UPLOADED TO THE SERVICE. </p>
        <p>IF, FOR ANY REASON, A COURT FINDS CHESS.COM LIABLE FOR DAMAGES NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT
          SHALL
          THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CHESS.COM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR FROM THE
          USE
          OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S.
          DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). </p>
        <p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT,
          STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN
          IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </p>
        <p class="legal-bold">EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS </p>
        <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF
          LIABILITY
          FOR
          INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
        <p class="legal-bold">Arbitration, Controlling Law, and Jurisdiction </p>
        <p>You agree that if you have any dispute with Chess.com relating in any way to these Terms of Service or from
          access to or use of the Service, you will first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us
          informally. If we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute,
          or
          controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with
          or
          relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under
          the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for
          the AAA, except as provided herein. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law shall
          apply
          to these Terms of Service. Unless you and AAA agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county
          where you reside. If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Chess.com of your
          intent
          to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Chess.com should be sent by sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service
          certified mail to: Chess.com, [address]. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or
          dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA
          filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Chess.com will pay for
          your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000
          and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Any
          award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and
          reasonable
          costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered
          in
          any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking
          injunctive
          or other
          equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized
          access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF
          OR
          CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE
          ARBITRATOR
          MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND
          CHESS.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
        <p> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above
          is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this section will be null and void. </p>
        <p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be governed by the
          laws of the State of California and the FAA without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions
          or your state or country of residence, and will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in
          Santa Clara County, California, United States. You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and
          waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
        <p class="legal-bold">Modifications to the Terms of Service </p>
        <p>We may modify these Terms at any time, and we will update the most current version at www.chess.com. If we
          determine that we have made a material change, we will notify you by sending you an email to the email address
          you provided when registering for your account or by posting a notice through the Service. If you continue to
          access or use the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms
          of
          Service.</p>
        <p class="legal-bold">General Information</p>

          Service are the entire and exclusive agreement between Chess.com and you regarding the Service, and these
          Terms
          of Service supersede and replace any prior agreements between Chess.com and you regarding the Service
          (excluding
          any services for which you have a separate agreement with Chess.com that is explicitly in addition or in place
          of these Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid, the remainder of the
          Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect. These Terms of Service and the rights granted and
          obligations undertaken hereunder may not be transferred, assigned, or delegated in any manner by you.
          Chess.com
          may freely assign these Terms of Service, and you expressly agree that any intellectual property rights
          licensed to Chess.com hereunder, including any rights to Content, are transferable to Chess.com’s assignee
          without your consent. The failure of Chess.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall
          not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. </p>
