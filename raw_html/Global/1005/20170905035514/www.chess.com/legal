    <h2><a name="termsofservice" id="termsofservice"></a>Terms of Service </h2>

    <p class="bold">Put simply: respect others, respect the law, and enjoy yourself!</p>
    <p>Chess.com provides its service to you subject to the following terms and conditions (the <em>&quot;Terms of Service&quot;</em>). </p>
    <p>BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACCEPT ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AND REPRESENT TO US THAT YOU ARE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER AND ARE LEGALLY COMPETENT TO ENTER INTO AND AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE PRIVACY POLICY AND THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR ARE THE PARENT OR AUTHORIZED GUARDIAN OF SOMEONE LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE FOR WHOM YOU HAVE CREATED AN ACCOUNT. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE PRIVACY POLICY AND THESE TERMS, THEN YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THE SERVICE. </p>
    <p>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE INCLUDE (1) AN ARBITRATION PROVISION; (2) A WAIVER OF RIGHTS TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US; AND (3) A RELEASE BY YOU OF ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGE AGAINST US THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES.

      its surrounding culture (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;). You accept
      that the Service may include advertisements. Chess.com reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
      modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You
      agree that Chess.com shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or
      discontinuance of the Service.</p>

    <p class="bold">Registration </p>

    <p class="bold">Minors &amp; Children</p>
    <p>Chess.com is concerned about the safety and privacy of all its users, particularly children. For this
      reason, parents or guardians of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Service
      must create an account that is maintained by a legal guardian of at least 18 years old and monitor the child's
      usage. By allowing a child access to your account, you also give your child permission to access all areas of the
      Service. Please remember that the Service is designed to appeal to a broad audience. Accordingly, as the legal
      guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for
      your child.</p>

    <p class="bold">Member Accounts </p>

      and are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your password or account. You agree to (a) immediately
      notify Chess.com of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure

      reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms of Service; (c) respond to claims that any Content
      (as defined below) violates the law or the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights,
      property or personal safety of Chess.com, its users and the public.</p>

    <p class="bold">LIMITATION OF LIABILITY </p>
    <p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT CHESS.COM AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, EQUIPMENT DOWNTIME, OR FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, EVEN IF CHESS.COM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, RELATING TO CHESS.COM, THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT APPEARING ON OR UPLOADED TO THE SERVICE. </p>
    <p>IF, FOR ANY REASON, A COURT FINDS CHESS.COM LIABLE FOR DAMAGES NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF CHESS.COM ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE OR ANY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00). </p>
    <p>THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION SHALL APPLY TO ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, STATUTE, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONSUMER PROTECTION LAW, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. </p>
    <p class="bold">EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS </p>
    <p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR
      INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
    <p class="bold">Arbitration, Controlling Law, and Jurisdiction </p>
    <p>You agree that if you have any dispute with Chess.com relating in any way to these Terms of Service or from access to or use of the Service, you will first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If we are unable to resolve the dispute informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) and federal arbitration law shall apply to these Terms of Service. Unless you and AAA agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If you intend to seek arbitration you must first send written notice to Chess.com of your intent
      to arbitrate (“Notice”). The Notice to Chess.com should be sent by sending the Notice by U.S. Postal Service certified mail to: Chess.com, [address]. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules, except that Chess.com will pay for your reasonable filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000 and is non-frivolous (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Any award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other
      equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property, or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND CHESS.COM ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.</p>
    <p> If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this section will be null and void. </p>
    <p>If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, the dispute will be governed by the laws of the State of California and the FAA without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence, and will be brought solely in the federal or state courts located in Santa Clara County, California, United States. You consent to the jurisdiction of and venue in such courts and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.</p>
    <p class="bold">Modifications to the Terms of Service </p>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time, and we will update the most current version at www.chess.com. If we determine that we have made a material change, we will notify you by sending you an email to the email address you provided when registering for your account or by posting a notice through the Service. If you continue to access or use the Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms of Service.</p>
    <p class="bold">General Information</p>

These Terms of Service are the entire and exclusive agreement between Chess.com and you regarding the Service, and these Terms of Service supersede and replace any prior agreements between Chess.com and you regarding the Service (excluding any services for which you have a separate agreement with Chess.com that is explicitly in addition or in place of these Terms of Service). If any provision of these Terms of Service is held invalid, the remainder of the Terms of Service shall continue in full force and effect.

Chess.com may freely assign these Terms of Service, and you expressly agree that any intellectual property rights
      licensed to Chess.com hereunder, including any rights to Content, are transferable to Chess.com’s assignee without your consent. The failure of Chess.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. </p>
