If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</p> <p>If you want to object to the processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p> <p> <b>Right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards where personal information are transferred to a third country or to an international organization</b> </p> <p> <i>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding safeguards when transferring your personal information to a third country as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</i> </p> <p>Refer to the Terms of Service for information on the safeguards that have been put in place to protect your personal information for transfer outside of the European Economic Area. For transfers to countries without an adequacy decision by the European Commission, Algolia puts appropriate safeguards through contractual obligations.</p> <p> <b>Right to Withdraw Consent</b> </p> <p> <i>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding withdrawing consent for processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</i> </p> <p>Where you have provided us with your consent to process personal information, you have the right to withdraw such consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p> <p>You can do this by:</p> <ul> <li>using certain web browser and opt-out options discussed in this Privacy Policy to limit the personal information you provide to us or our third-party partners (please see Section 4 “Does Algolia collect personal information automatically?”, Section 6 “When and how does Algolia share my personal information with others?” and Section 10 "Communication Preferences and Subscriptions”),</li> <li>logging into the appropriate Website or Service and contacting us through the Support Center,</li> <li>following the unsubscribe instructions included in emails,</li> <li>through <a href="https://goto.algolia.com/preferences">https://goto.algolia.com/preferences</a>,</li> <li>by accessing the email preferences in your account settings page in the Services user interface dashboard, or</li> <li>sending us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</li> </ul> <p> <b>Right to Submit Complaints or Report Abuse</b> </p> <p>You also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in your country of residence, if you consider that the processing of your personal information infringes applicable laws.</p> <p>If you need to report abuse, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:abuse@algolia.com">abuse@algolia.com</a>.</p> <p> <b>California Privacy Rights</b> </p> <p>California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of our Websites and Services that are California residents to opt-out from the disclosure of your personal information to third-parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p> <p>Please be advised that where California State residents opt-out from permitting their personal information to be shared, such individuals may still receive selected offers directly from us, in accordance with applicable law.</p> <h3 class='text lg'>9.

Algolia may process data to provide the Services, to prevent or address technical or service problems, to follow the instructions of our subscribers and their personnel who submitted the personal information, or in response to contractual or legal requirements. Algolia does not control or own the data submitted by its subscribers, or their internet clients or end users, to the Services.
