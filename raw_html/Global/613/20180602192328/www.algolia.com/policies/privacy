You can also request closure of your account. We will respond to your request within 30 days.</p> <p>In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know that we are unable to do so and why.</p> <p> <b>Right to Data Portability</b> </p> <p> <i>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding the data portability of your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</i> </p> <p>You have the right to receive or transfer a copy of your personal information, where:</p> <ul> <li>we are relying upon your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party as the legal basis for the processing, and</li> <li>personal information is processed by automatic means.</li> </ul> <p>This copy will be provided to you in a common machine-readable format.

This right includes restricting the processing of your personal information to only include storage of your personal information (e.g. during the time when Algolia assesses whether you are entitled to have personal information erased).</p> <p>If you want to request restriction of processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p> <p> <b>Right to object to processing justified on legitimate interest grounds</b> </p> <p> <i>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding objections to processing your personal information as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</i> </p> <p>Where we are relying upon legitimate interest to process personal information, you have the right to object to that processing. If you object, we must stop that processing unless we can either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing that override your interests, rights and freedoms or where we need to process the personal information for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. Where we rely upon legitimate interest as a basis for processing we believe that we can demonstrate such compelling legitimate grounds, but we will consider each case on an individual basis.</p> <p>If you want to object to the processing of your personal information, you can login to the appropriate Website or Service and contact us through the Support Center, or you may send us an email at the address noted in the Contact Information section above.</p> <p> <b>Right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards where personal information are transferred to a third country or to an international organization</b> </p> <p> <i>If Algolia processes your personal information on behalf of or at the direction of one of our subscribers, you should first look to that subscriber for assistance regarding safeguards when transferring your personal information to a third country as described in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy.</i> </p> <p>Refer to the Terms of Service for information on the safeguards that have been put in place to protect your personal information for transfer outside of the European Economic Area.
