<p>This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we may collect, how we may use and disclose the information once it is collected, and, where applicable, how you can stop us from collecting, using, disclosing or continuing to hold your information. We want to ensure that in using any of the Services, you understand the terms of this Privacy Policy, including any subsequent changes made to the Privacy Policy as described in Part 11 below, and are aware of the privacy choices available to you. Please note that this Privacy Policy <u>does not</u> apply to information that you may provide to us, or that we may obtain, where a separate privacy policy is made available to you or which do not make this Privacy Policy available.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What <g class="gr_ gr_340 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="340" data-gr-id="340">information may</g> be collected?</h3>
<h4><b><i>User-Provided Information</i></b></h4>
<p>During your use of a Service (whether as a registered or unregistered user), you may provide us with personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, or other information that could be used to identify you as an individual or allow someone to contact you, as well as any information associated with such information (collectively, &ldquo;Personal Information&rdquo;). Personal Information includes both things that specifically identify you (like your real name) and things that don&rsquo;t specifically identify <g class="gr_ gr_326 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="326" data-gr-id="326">you,</g> but might be connected back to you (like the IP address of your computer or the device identifier of your smartphone).</p>
<h4><b><i>Location Data</i></b></h4>
<p>When using our Services from a mobile device (a &ldquo;Mobile Service&rdquo;), you may share the geographic location of your device with us. Your device location may be transmitted to us whenever a Mobile Service is running (even if you are not actively using the Mobile Service or it is running in the background on your device). Your device may continue to transmit its location to us until you change your device settings.</p>
<p>If you set your device not to transmit location information to us, certain features of our Services may not be available or their functions may be limited. For example, you will have to manually enter a location when conducting a search. You should also know that turning off location sharing only prevents your device from sharing its precise location. Your network service provider may still provide general location information (based on access points you&rsquo;ve connected to, for example). The information provided varies by network service provider. You should check with your network service provider to find out what information is provided and if there are ways for you to limit it.</p>
<h4><b><i>Service Usage Information</i></b></h4>
<p>As is typical of many <g class="gr_ gr_300 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="300" data-gr-id="300">web sites</g> and mobile applications, when you use our Services, we may collect information about your device and your usage of our Services including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your IP address (which we may associate with your domain name or that of your Internet access provider or wireless carrier, and your location);</li>
<li>Unique ID number associated with your device;</li>
<li>Other unique identifiers such as advertising identifiers (e.g., "ad-ID" or "IDFA");</li>
<li>Web browser and operating system information;</li>
<li><g class="gr_ gr_313 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="313" data-gr-id="313">Language</g> of your device;</li>
<li>Wireless connections you are using;</li>
<li>Referring page that linked you to us;</li>
<li>Your activities, including browsing and transaction history;</li>
<li>Pages, content, and <g class="gr_ gr_301 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="301" data-gr-id="301">ads</g> you view or click on during your use of our Services, and when and for how long you do so;</li>
<li>The next web site you visit after leaving our <g class="gr_ gr_303 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="303" data-gr-id="303">web site</g>; and</li>
<li>Search terms you enter on our Services or a referral site.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we may deploy tracking technologies through our Services to collect additional information about your use of the Services, as set out in the &ldquo;Cookies and other tracking technologies&rdquo; section of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How is your information used?</h3>
<p>We or our service providers may use the information we collect from or about you to perform the following functions:</p>
<ul>
<li>administer our Services and your account with us;</li>
<li>enable you to use our Services and their features;</li>
<li>customize our Services to your interests and history with us;</li>

<li>improve or develop new features and offerings in our Services;</li>
<li>tailor ads displayed to you in our Services and elsewhere;</li>
<li>send you marketing and other communications, including information about products, services, or events that we think might be of interest to you;</li>
<li>assess your level of interest in and use of our Services, e-mails, and other messaging campaigns, both on an individual basis and in aggregate;</li>
<li>generate analytics reports on the usage of our Services; and</li>
<li>respond to your requests, questions, and concerns protecting our rights and property.</li>
</ul>
<p>We may also use Personal Information to meet our internal and external audit requirements and for information security purposes. Where permissible under applicable law, your Personal Information may be used for other purposes, which will be disclosed to you at the time when your information is collected. There may be instances, however, when we will use your Personal Information for purposes that were not disclosed at the time of the data collection; for example, when doing so is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or requirement. We may use Personal Information to (a) respond to requests from courts, law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, and other public and government authorities, which may include such authorities outside your country of residence; (b) enforce our terms and conditions; and (c) protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, or those of other persons.</p>
<p>Some of the uses specified above are necessary for the performance of a contract between us, or for the provision of a service requested by you. In other cases, the uses are based on our legitimate interests such as marketing our services to people who have expressed an interest in them or similar services.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><b><i>Transfers outside the European Economic Area (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;) </i></b></h4>
<p>The information described in this section of the Privacy Policy, with respect to the transfer of data outside the EEA, applies to those individuals located in the EEA. To process information of individuals located in the EEA for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, it is sometimes necessary for us to share your personal data outside the EEA, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>with our offices outside the EEA;</li>
<li>with service providers located outside the EEA;</li>
<li>if you are based outside the EEA;</li>
<li>where we consider that the transfer is necessary for exercising, establishing or defending legal rights including, as appropriate, providing information to respond to a government, law enforcement, judicial or <g class="gr_ gr_309 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="309" data-gr-id="309">other legal request</g>, or otherwise to comply with applicable law.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-EEA countries might not have the same legal framework for data protection as the EEA countries. In particular, the United States, which is the most common destination of our transfers of Personal Information outside the EEA, is not considered to provide a level of personal data protection equivalent to that of the EEA. We will, however, ensure the transfers comply with EU data protection law. Our standard practice is to use standard data protection contract clauses approved by the European Commission as the basis for such data transfers. &nbsp;You may read more about this on the European Commission Justice website at (http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm).</p>
<p>If you would like further information, please see &ldquo;Contact us&rdquo; section below.</p>

<p>If you create an account on our Services, you are responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your account password, and you shall be responsible for any activity, including disclosure of your Personal Information, that occurs using your account credentials, whether or not you authorized such activity.

<p>We have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. If we believe that the security of your Personal Information in our care may have been compromised, we will endeavor to notify you of that development promptly taking into consideration the circumstances. If we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. Where legally required to do so, we also will notify any applicable regulator.</p>

<h3><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Links and connections to Third Party Services</h3>
<p>We maintain a presence on social media and other external platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. We may occasionally incorporate third party social networking features into our Services. This Privacy Policy applies to our use of information you submit to us there, but it does not apply to what those third-party platforms do with your information.</p>
<p>Our Services may allow you to share information with us that you have already provided to a third party social networking platform. For example, you may be able to create an account on our Service or log in to our Service using your Facebook account or other third-party credentials. If you do so, Personal Information or other data that you have provided to the third party may be made available to us by that third party subject to its own privacy policy, terms, and conditions. Privacy policies of social networks and other external platforms explain how those third parties use, protect, and share your information, including any information you share on those platforms from our Services, and we encourage you to read them. The information we receive from these platforms may depend on your privacy settings. Any such information that we obtain will remain subject to that third party&rsquo;s privacy policy and we will use any such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We may also include tools in our Services that allow you to share or publicly post content from our Services to your profile on a third party social network. You may choose to share information about your activities on the Service with such third party platforms and its users, including publishing your information about what content you may have viewed on our Services. If you visit a Service while logged into certain social media platforms, the social media platform may be able to identify your browser and associate the technical information provided by your web browser with other information that they have already collected about you, which may result in their ability to identify you. In addition, when you choose to share information about your activities on the Service with certain social media platforms, AP may send technical information about you to that platform as well as information about what content you are viewing.</p>
<p>Our Service may contain links, banners, widgets, or advertisements that lead to third-party <g class="gr_ gr_231 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="231" data-gr-id="231">web sites</g>. We are not responsible for these other <g class="gr_ gr_232 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="232" data-gr-id="232">web sites</g>, and so their posted privacy policies (not this Privacy Policy) will govern the collection and use of your information on them. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of <g class="gr_ gr_233 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="233" data-gr-id="233">web site</g> visited after leaving our Services to learn about how your information is treated by others.</p>
<p>Our Services may contain certain co-sponsored content and you may be requested to provide additional Personal Information to the co-sponsor of such content. We will disclose to you when you are submitting Personal Information to co-sponsors. The information practices of any third party co-sponsors are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4><b><i>Third-Party Ad Servers and Networks</i></b></h4>
<p>We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Services.</p>
<p>When you view an advertisement, whether or not you click on it, the advertiser, advertising technology companies, web analytics companies <g class="gr_ gr_276 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="276" data-gr-id="276">and</g> service providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our business partners may collect some information from or about you. These companies may use information about your visits to the Services, the geographic location where your IP address indicates you are located, as well as other information about (which such companies may obtain via your use of our Services or elsewhere) you in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. These advertisements may appear in our Services and on other online properties or mobile applications. These companies may employ cookies, clear GIFs and other tracking technologies to cause relevant ads to be displayed to you. We do not control any such technologies that may appear in our Services or other online properties or mobile applications. &nbsp;The information practices of these third parties are governed by their own privacy policies and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to read these businesses&rsquo; privacy policies to learn about how they treat your information.</p>

<h3><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do Not Track Disclosures</h3>
<p>Some web browsers may transmit &ldquo;do-not-track&rdquo; (&ldquo;DNT&rdquo;) signals to mobile applications with which the user communicates. We currently do not change our tracking practices (which are explained in more detail under &ldquo;Service Usage Information&rdquo; above) in response to DNT settings in your web browser.</p>
<p>Our <g class="gr_ gr_235 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="235" data-gr-id="235">third party</g> partners, such as web analytics companies and <g class="gr_ gr_238 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="238" data-gr-id="238">third party</g> ad networks, may collect information about you and your online activities over time and across our Services and other online properties. These third parties may not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings. We utilize Google Analytics for our web analytics and you can opt out of your usage data being included in our Google Analytics reports by visiting https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>

<p>In some jurisdictions, including in the countries of the European Economic Area, you have the right, in certain circumstances, to (i) require us delete your Personal Information, (ii) require us to restrict processing of your Personal Information (for example, if you contest the accuracy of that information), (iii) receive a copy of the Personal Information you provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and/or instruct us to transmit that data to a third party; and (iv) object to our continued processing of your Personal Information, for direct marketing (including profiling) or other purposes.
