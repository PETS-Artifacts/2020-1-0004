        <p>5.2	We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to.  Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:</p>

            <li>5.2.1	Where we need to perform the contract (e.g. the Terms of Use) we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
            <li>5.2.2	Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
            <li>5.2.3	Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>5.3	Generally we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data.  If we do rely on your consent to process your personal data this will be made clear to you at the time, and you have the right to decline to provide us with your consent and to withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us. </p>

        <p>5.4	We do not request from you and we request you do not provide any special categories/sensitive personal data (e.g. personal data relating to racial or ethnic origin, political or religious opinions, membership of a trade union, physical or mental health or condition or sexual life or orientation).  This type of personal data is subject to special protections under EU law.</p>

        <p>5.5	We may process your personal data for more than one lawful ground depending on the specific purpose for which we are using your personal data.  Please contact us using <a href="mailto: gdpr@irishjobs.ie" title="email gdpr@irishjobs.ie">gdpr@irishjobs.ie</a> if you need details, in addition to those set out below, about the specific legal ground we are relying on to process your personal data.</p>

        <p><strong>5.6 We use your personal data in the following ways:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>5.6.1	We will collect and use your Identity; Contact; Profile and Financial Data (Customers only) to register you as a new user of the Website or to register Customers.  This is necessary in order to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you. </li>
            <li>5.6.2	We will collect and use your Identity, Contact and Profile Data to provide Customers with the information that you submit to the Website in response Job Specifications.  This is necessary in order to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you.  Details of your application for a Job Specification will only ever be shared with the Customer advertising the role.  It will never be shared with any other Customer.</li>
            <li>5.6.3	If you request the CV Database Service we will process your Identity, Contact and Profile Data to:</li>
            <li>(a)	maintain this personal data in our database of searchable and viewable CVs and resumes ("CV Database"); </li>
            <li>(b)	display your CV or resume and associated personal data for our Customers and customers of Jobs.ie Limited and NIJobs.com Limited, so that our Customers and their customers are able to evaluate whether you are a suitable candidate for a vacant position (whether or not a Job Specification);</li>
            <li>(c)	identify and create a profile of the key information you disclosed in your CV or resume, which we will use for our internal administration purposes to manage the CV Database, to enhance your personal profile and to match your CV or resume to relevant Job Specifications. This processing involves profiling, the consequence of which is that the key personal data we identify from your CV or resume will be used to enhance the likelihood of a Customer, and customers of Jobs.ie and NIJobs.com, considering you for a Job Specification and</li>
            <li>(d)	identify from your CV or resume key skills based on your current role and job title contained in your CV or resume, which we will use to match your CV or resume to relevant Job Specifications. This processing involves automated decision making, including profiling, of the kind referred to in Article 22 GDPR. The logic of this processing involves assumptions based on information you submit with your CV or resume, but which you can change at any time by accessing “Account Settings” in “Your Account” of the Website where you can change the key skills we selected on your behalf. You can contact us at <a href="mailto: gdpr@irishjobs.ie" title="email gdpr@irishjobs.ie">gdpr@irishjobs.ie</a> if you need our assistance with this.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The processing described in this section 5.6.3 is necessary in order for us to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you, and in respect of sub-sections (a), (b) and (c) is necessary for our legitimate interest to increase the possibility of registered users gaining employment which in turn improves the IrishJobs.ie Service. You will be able to control the type of personal data about you which will be processed in this way by accessing “Account Settings” in “Your Account” of the Website.  </p>

        <p>5.6.4	We may promote your CV or resume to a Customer where we believe your CV is a good match to a vacant position.  This matching will be based on a profile of the job specifications you have interacted with recently.  This processing is necessary in order for us to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you.  You will be able to control the type of personal data about you which will be displayed in this way through your “Your Account” page of the Website.</p>

        <p>5.6.5	We will collect and use Profile, Technical and Usage Data for data analytics purposes to improve the Website, products/services, marketing, user/Customer relationships and experience.  This involves building a profile of your interests based on the job specifications you have interacted with in the past 45 days.  This is necessary for our legitimate interest to ensure that Website content is presented in an effective manner for you and for your computer/device.</p>

        <p>5.6.6	We collect and use Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data and Marketing and Communications Data to send registered users of the Website Job Alerts and Instant Job Alerts by email to help with your job search.  This involves building a profile of your interests based on the job specifications you have interacted with in the past 45 days.  This is necessary (i) in order for us to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you; and (ii) for our legitimate interest to ensure registered users are informed of roles relevant to them which in turn improves our service.  To facilitate your ease of use of the Website across multiple devices, Job Alerts by email include a personalised link which will recognize you when you visit the Website by clicking on a link in the email.  This makes it easy for you to apply for jobs as your name, email address, and link to your last used CV will automatically be populated in the Job application form.  As Job Alert emails are personalised to you, it is important that you do not share these email links with other people or post them on social media.  You are responsible for maintaining the security of these personal Job Alert email links.  Sharing personalised Job Alerts could result in somebody inadvertently applying for a job in your name.</p>

        <p>5.6.7	We collect and use Technical, Usage and Profile Data for data analytics purposes to build an understanding of the sort of jobs registered users of the Website are most interested in by learning from the jobs you view and apply for to tailor the jobs we present to you.  Our understanding of the jobs you might like will adapt and change as it is based on the job content you interact with over a rolling 45 day period.  This will involve profiling.  This is necessary for our legitimate interest to ensure registered users are informed of roles relevant to them which in turn improves our service;</p>

        <p>5.6.8	We will collect and use Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, Profile Data and Marketing and Communications Data to communicate to registered users of the Website via email about similar products or services from IrishJobs.ie that will assist with your job search.  This is necessary in order for us to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you. </p>

        <p>5.6.9	We will collect and use Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage, Profile Data and Marketing and Communications Data to send you career support and advice emails from IrishJobs.ie and job and training opportunities from trusted third party partners that you request from us or which we feel may interest you, but only where you have consented to be contacted for such purposes.  This processing of your personal data is based on your consent and our legitimate interests to direct market, develop our products/services and grow our business.</p>

        <p>5.6.10	We or a registered Customer may use your Identity and Contact Data to contact you where you are a registered user or if you have responded to a Job Specification.  This is necessary for us to perform our contract (e.g. Terms of Use) with you and our legitimate interest to perform services for Customers.</p>

        <p>5.6.11	We will collect and use Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical and Usage Data to allow you to participate in interactive features on the Website and one or more IrishJobs.ie Services, when you choose to do so.

For transfers to countries outside the EEA, the data protection regime may be different than in the country in which you are located and will therefore be based on a legally adequate transfer method.

        <p>11.1.1	Where the country has been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission.  For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries.</p>

        <p>11.1.2	We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries.</p>

        <p>11.1.3	Where service providers are based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the EU-US Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.  For further details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. </p>

        <p>11.2	We will provide you on request a list of the countries located outside the EEA to which personal data may be transferred, and an indication of whether they have been determined by the European Commission to grant adequate protection to personal data.  Where applicable, you are entitled, upon request to receive a copy of the relevant safeguard (for example, EC model contractual clauses) that has been taken to protect personal data during such transfer. </p>

        <a name="12"></a><h2>12	DATA SECURITY</h2>

        <p>16.1	We retain personal data for no longer than is allowed under data protection law and, in any case, no longer than such personal data is necessary for the purpose for which it was processed.  To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the purposes for which we process personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.</p>

        <p>16.2	As a registered user of the Website we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical, Usage, Marketing and Communications Data for as long as your user account is live.  We retain the personal data you provide while your account is in existence or as needed to provide you access to the Website and any IrishJobs.ie Service you have used.  Even if you only use the Website or any other IrishJobs.ie Service occasionally, we will retain your Identity, Contact, Profile, Technical, Usage, Marketing and Communications Data until you decide to close your user account.  In some cases we retain certain Usage Data (e.g. visitor and application statistics in a depersonalized or aggregated form).  Also, we retain personal data for longer if required by applicable law or regulation or justified under applicable statutory limitation periods.</p>

        <p>16.3	If you respond to a Job Specification, request us to publish your CV or resume on our CV Database Service or otherwise communicate with Customers via the Website a copy of your job application, CV or resume and a record of the communication will be held on the Customer’s user account.

Details of all the job applications you make through the Website can be viewed by you in Your Account.</p>

        <a name="17"></a><h2>17	YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</h2>

        <p>17.1	Under certain circumstances you have rights under applicable data protection law in relation to personal data, namely: </p>

        <p>17.1.1	Request access to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”).  This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.</p>

        <p>17.1.2	Request correction of the personal data that we hold about you.  This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.</p>

        <p>17.1.3	Request erasure of your personal data.  This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it.  You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.  Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.</p>

        <p>17.1.4	Object to processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms.  You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes.  In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.</p>

        <p>17.1.5	Request restriction of processing of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.</p>

        <p>17.1.6	Request the transfer of your personal data to you or to a third party.  We will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.  Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you. </p>

        <p>17.1.7	Withdraw consent at any time if and to the extent we are relying on consent as the legal basis to process your personal data.  However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.  If you withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you.  We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.</p>

        <p>17.2	Regarding your right to have your personal data erased, you can delete your user account with IrishJobs.ie at any time.  Deleting your user account deletes records of job applications sent, CVs and cover letters stored in your account, your profile, saved jobs and job alerts.  Once your user account is deleted, it is gone forever and cannot be restored.  Some personal data however may still be stored and visible in other places on the Website.  For example, if you have applied for a job, your application information including your name, email, CV and cover letter may still be visible to the Customer in their user account on the Website.  We will endeavour to contact Customers we know who have accessed your personal data within the previous 18 months and inform them of your request to erase your personal data. </p>

        <p>17.3	You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).  However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.  Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights).  This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.  We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response. </p>

        <p>17.4	In order to exercise one or more of your rights in respect of your personal data, you can do so from the Account Settings option in Your Account on the Website.  Alternatively, please contact us at <a href="mailto: gdpr@irishjobs.ie" title="email gdpr@irishjobs.ie">gdpr@irishjobs.ie</a>.  We will respond to your request(s) as soon as reasonably practicable, but in any case within the legally required period of time.</p>

        <p>17.5	You have the right to make a complaint at any time to the Data Protection Commission, the Irish supervisory authority for data protection issues <a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie"> (https://www.dataprotection.ie)</a>.  We would, however, appreciate the chance to deal with your concerns before you approach the Data Protection Commission so please contact us in the first instance at <a href="mailto: gdpr@irishjobs.ie" title="email gdpr@irishjobs.ie">gdpr@irishjobs.ie</a></p>
