					<p>Welcome to STV’s digital products and services (together the “Services”). These Terms of Use, effective from 02 May 2014, apply whether you have joined STV or are just visiting. They contain our <strong><a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy</a></strong> and our <strong><a href="#cookies">Cookie Policy</a></strong>, as well as our terms for <strong><a href="#competition">Competitions and Voting</a></strong> and our <strong><a href="#house-rules">House Rules</a></strong> for leaving Comments</p>

<p><strong>THESE TERMS OF USE ARE IMPORTANT FOR YOU AND FOR US.  THEY EXPLAIN:-</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>your rights and responsibilities</p></li>
<li><p>our responsibilities to you</p></li>
<li><p>how we expect you to interact with the Services and with other users</p></li>
</ul>

<p>By using the Services, you are understood to have read and accepted these <strong><a href="#termsofuse">Terms of Use</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Things change and so, from time to time, will these Terms of Use.  We advise you to take a fresh look every so often. In addition, some specific terms may vary around particular programmes or events; when they do, we will do our best to highlight those changes to you.</br></p>

<h2><strong>1. Who delivers the Services to me?</strong></h2>

<p>We are STV Central Limited, a company registered in Scotland no. 172149, and registered for VAT in the UK, no. GB 612 4395 58. If you have any queries, you can contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:enquiries@stv.tv">enquiries@stv.tv</a></strong> phone us on +44 (0)141 300 3000, or write to us at Pacific Quay, Glasgow G51 1PQ, which is our registered address.</p>

<h2><strong>2. What are the Services?</strong></h2>

<p>The Services include, by way of example, our website <a href="http://www.stv.tv">www.stv.tv</a>; our STV Player (carrying both (i) live simultaneous internet transmission of our on-air broadcast services; and (iii) on demand catch-up programme services); any of our mobile or tablet apps; and our online social media accounts. These Terms of Use apply regardless of the device you use to access the Services.
We aim to provide constant and uninterrupted access to the Services, but we do not take responsibility for internet or connection issues outside our control. Specifically we do not guarantee:-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>the availability of the Services on each and every device all of the time</p></li>
<li><p>that any technical issues that arise can be resolved quickly</p></li>
<li><p>that the Services are virus or bug free</p></li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>3. How may I use the Services?</strong></h2>

<p>You agree to use the Services only for lawful purposes, and in a manner that does not infringe the rights of third parties, or restrict or inhibit the use and enjoyment of the Services by any other user.
Specifically, you agree you shall not:-</p>

<ul>
<li>de-compile, reverse engineer, reproduce, copy, distribute, hire, license or sell the Services and/or the Content (or any part of them), in any way, other than as expressly permitted in these Terms of Service. </li>
<li>use the Service for the transmission of any spam or computer viruses. </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>4. What do we mean when we refer to “Content” on the Services?</strong></h2>

<p>Content can be programmes, video, audio, text, images, either owned or licensed to us by users or by third parties.</p>

<h2><strong>5. What I should know about using the Content?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Geo-restrictions</strong> 
We take "geo-blocking" measures to prevent access to some Content in case where rights restrictions apply.  Specifically, there is some Content which will not be accessible if you are located outside the central and north regions of Scotland (where we broadcast the Channel 3 service), and/or outside the United Kingdom.
You agree not to circumvent any geo-blocking measures or to access, or attempt to access, such Content if you are located in areas to which we have prevented access.</p>

<p><strong>Availability</strong></p>

<p>We may require that your register your details for certain Services and open an account that you can use to access and log on to those Services.  See <a href="#joining">7. Joining below. </a></p>

<p><strong>STV Watch live</strong>
To watch live broadcasts on any of STV's television channels via your computer or other mobile electronic device, using the "Watch Live" button on the STV Player, you must be in possession of a current TV licence.</p>

<p><strong>STV Player – programme catch up suitability</strong></p>

<p>Some of the Content available on the STV Player may contain material unsuitable for under 18s or be of a nature that you would prefer to avoid.</p>

<p>We will endeavour to provide guidance where content may be unsuitable for under 18s.  This is indicated by a symbol “G” (for guidance) along with the reason for the guidance.  You need to be 18 to view Content on the STV Player which has been labelled with a “G” symbol.  The guidance wording serves as advisory information for all users.</p>

<p>We have built parental guidance controls into the STV Player.  Once set, these controls will prevent the viewing of Content labelled with a “G” symbol from that device unless a 4 figure PIN is entered.    It’s up to you to set the parental guidance controls if anyone under 18 has access to your device. If you do not set them, then any person under 18 using your device will have access to all Content available on the STV Player, including Content labelled with a "G" symbol.</p>

<p>Furthermore, by use of an “I” symbol, we endeavour to signal to all users Content which you may wish to avoid, or may find upsetting or disturbing.</p>

<p><strong>“Catch Up” of Archive Content is not live</strong></p>

<p>Any catch up or archive Content available on the STV Player is not live. Please do not respond to any invitation to enter any competition, phone-in, vote, quiz or any other interaction, as the interaction may have come to an end.  If you do so, you may still be charged, and your interaction may be too late, and not included, or considered.</p>

<p><strong>STV Player - live streaming</strong></p>

<p>When we are streaming our channels over the internet there is a delay but the service is as near live as possible. Please bear this in mind when interacting with our Services. "Live streaming" refers to events which are not being broadcast on STV's normal broadcast channels. For live broadcasts, see under STV Watch Live (above)</p>

<p><strong>Technical interference to our Content by you</strong></p>

<p>We may use technical measures for the security and protection of Content. You agree not to interfere with any such technical measures, or unlawfully access, or use, our servers, systems or Content, nor to attempt to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy of the Content</strong></p>

<p>Although we take great care over the Content we produce, it may contain statements and opinions which are not our own, and with which we do not necessarily agree.  We do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of all the Content.</p>

<h2><strong>6. Whose Content is it?</strong></h2>

<p>All copyright, trade marks and other intellectual property rights in the Content belong to us or our licensors. The Content is protected by various intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws, such as copyright and trade mark laws. You may not reproduce or distribute any or all of Content except as provided below.</p>

<p>You may use the Content for your personal, non-commercial use and otherwise only as expressly permitted by these Terms of Use. You may, provided they are credited to STV, publish short excerpts from, or summaries of, a published article accompanied by a hyperlink which, when clicked, takes the reader to the whole article on our relevant Use.</p>

<p>Your use of the Content must not, at our sole discretion, bring, or be likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.</p>

<h2> <a id="joining"><strong>7. Joining</strong></a></h2>

<p>If you choose to join the Services, rather than just remaining a visitor, you will be asked to enter personal information which will include your name; email address and a password ("Log-in details"), <strong>or</strong> you may join using an account you have already established with a social media platform. For information on how STV use your data, see our <a href="#privacy">Privacy Policy.</a></p>

<p>You should keep your Log-in details confidential, and must not allow anyone else to use them.</p>

<p>You must use your real name and a current email address.   You must not create accounts for the purpose of abusing any functionality of the Services, or other users, nor pass yourself off as another user.</p>

<p>You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Log-in details.</p>

<h2><strong>8. What are the rules around interacting with the Services?</strong></h2>

<p>You (or those who have given you permission to use it) own any material (including the intellectual property rights therein) that you contribute to the Services, whether it be video; photograph, graphic, audio, or text (“Your Contribution”), and may carry on using it.</p>

<p>When you submit Your Contribution you are granting to us and our group of companies a worldwide royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable licence to use Your Contribution on any media, platform or device (including on television) and to use, edit, and further distribute it across any media, platform or device throughout the world at any time, and to grant sub-licences.</p>

<p>For editorial and compliance reasons, we might need to alter Your Contribution and you authorise us to do so on the understanding that STV will not alter it in any way that misrepresents it.</p>

<p>By submitting Your Contribution you confirm that:-</p>

<ul>
<li><p>it will not infringe or contravene any rights of any third parties or contain anything which is defamatory, obscene or unlawful</p></li>
<li><p>you are over 16, or have permission from your parent or guardian if under 16</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Your participation in shared activity over the Services, such as posting comments, or blogging is subject to your compliance with our <strong><a href="#house-rules">House Rules</a></strong>.</p>

<p>If you see Content on the Services that you believe should not be there, please contact us without delay at <strong><a href="mailto:enquiries@stv.tv">enquiries@stv.tv</a></strong> or, in the case of Comments, through the Comment reporting system, outlining why you think it should be removed and including a link to it. This will help us deal with your concern more quickly.</p>

<p>Furthermore, whilst not moderating or controlling user Comments posted to our site, we reserve the right to suspend or delete without notice any material which</p>

<p>(a) we believe at our sole discretion to be detrimental to the enjoyment of the Services by users;</p>

<p>(b) breaches the Terms of Use and/or the House Rules;</p>

<p>(c) is the subject of any copyright infringement notice; or</p>

<p>(d) brings, or is likely to bring, STV into disrepute, or otherwise cause any loss or damage to STV.</p>

<h2><strong>9. Breach of Terms of Use</strong></h2>

<p>We will determine, at our absolute discretion, where there has been a breach of these Terms of Use. Where STV suspects that a breach has occurred, we may take such action as we deem appropriate which may include all, or any, of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Immediate, temporary or permanent withdrawal of your right to use the Services.</p></li>
<li><p>Immediate, temporary or permanent removal of any posting or material uploaded by you to the Services.</p></li>
<li><p>Issue of a warning to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Commence legal proceedings against you.</p></li>
<li><p>Disclosure of information to law enforcement authorities as we consider necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We exclude liability for lawful actions taken by us in response to breaches of these Terms of Use.</p>

<h2><strong>10. Links to third party services</strong></h2>

<p>You are solely responsible for evaluating the integrity of the operators of any third party websites accessed through the Services; the accuracy and completeness of any information contained on them, and the value and authenticity of any goods or services offered through them, [and their data collection practices.</p>

<h2><strong>11. Other</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Liability</strong></p>

<p>In no event shall we be liable for any claims, loss or damage arising, out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use the Services, including, without limitation, direct or indirect loss, consequential loss or damage, loss of profit or goodwill, or for loss arising from any errors or omissions in the Services, or in the Content.</p>

<p>Nothing in these Terms of Use excludes or limits any liability which may not be excluded by any applicable law.</p>

<p><strong>Waiver</strong></p>

<p>If you breach any of these Terms of Use, and we choose not to take action against you, that does not necessarily mean that we will waive any subsequent breaches by you. In addition, if we do not exercise the entire remedy available to us we may still do so at a later date.</p>

<p><strong>Law and Jurisdiction</strong></p>

<p>These Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with Scots law. All disputes arising from them shall be submitted to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Scottish courts.</p>

<p><strong><a id="house-rules"> Comments and STV House Rules </a></strong></p>

<p>We want your views but we also want to make this a place where people feel they can contribute without being shouted down. So we have a few simple House Rules which we ask you to respect. We reserve the right to take down or edit anything that we consider breaks these rules.
These apply to any kind of contribution you make, not just to words but to pictures and videos as well.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stay on the topic at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't post anonymously.</p></li>
<li><p>Respect others; disagree as strongly as you like with someone but don’t spoil your argument by attacking or insulting them personally. That also means no hate speech, profanities or what we perceive as discrimination against groups or individuals.</p></li>
<li><p>Solid facts always back up an argument; so be as accurate as you can. Better still, leave a link to where you got the information.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t include personal information (such as addresses or phone numbers), yours or anybody else’s.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it legal – that means not defamatory, in breach of copyright, in contempt of court or in breach of privacy laws (see 5, above). Remember you are responsible for what you say.</p></li>
<li><p>No spam, advertising, spurious links or anything misleading.</p></li>
<li><p>We (that is, STV) welcome your views on our own products and services but we will delete material that is incorrect or just plain abusive.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If you see anything on our Services that you feel should not be there, please click on the word "Flag" on the Comment to alert us to it. You can also contact <strong><a href="mailto:enquiries@stv.tv">enquiries@stv.tv</a></strong> or phone us on 0141 300 3704. We will deal with it as quickly as we can.</p>
