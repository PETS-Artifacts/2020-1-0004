      <h4>VIII - CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT</h4>
      <p>
        If you wish to close your account with one of our Services, please send your request to closemyaccount@chegg.com and we will remove your Personal Information and Profile, if applicable, from the active databases for the Service(s) you request. Please let us know which Service(s) you wish to close and send your request using an email account that you have registered with Chegg.
      </p>
      <p> 
        Even if your account is closed, information may remain in backup records and we retain certain data if necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse or for legitimate business purposes: analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery or if required by law. All retained data will continue to be subject to this Notice.
      </p>
      <h4>IX - THIRD PARTY CONTENT, LINKS TO OTHER SITES</h4>
      <p>
        Certain content provided through the Services is hosted and served by third parties, which may include third party widgets (those that allow you to "like" or "share" content with third party web sites and online services). These features may collect your Device Identifier, which page you are visiting on our web site, and may set a cookie to enable the third party feature to function properly. These third parties may independently collect data. In some instances, we may require that you participate in the Services through a third party application or feature and, if you choose not to authorize or use the required third party application or feature, you will not be able to use the applicable Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chegg has no control over third party web sites which are governed by the privacy policies and business practices of those third parties.
      </p>
      <h4>X - SECURITY</h4>
      <p>
        Chegg takes appropriate security measures to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. For example, we encrypt credit card numbers.  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, as in any real-life scenario, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <h4>XI - INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS</h4>
      <p>
        The Services are operated in the European Economic Area ("EEA") and United States. Please be aware that information we collect will be transferred to and processed in the United States: a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside.  Transfers from our European subsidiaries are made using the Model Clauses approved by the European Commission.
      </p>
      <h4>XII - CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
      <p>
        Chegg may update this Notice at any time and any changes will be effective upon posting of the revised Notice unless otherwise specified. In the event that there are material changes to the way we treat your Personal Information, we will display a notice through the Services of the updated Notice. We endeavour to notify you in other ways, for example through contact information you have provided.
