	<h3>The Walking Company Website Security Policy</h3>
	<p>We take the issue of online security very seriously. It is your information, and we make sure it stays that way.</p>
	<p>The Walking Company has put many safeguards into our electronic store so that you can enjoy your shopping experience without having to worry about credit card transactions. Our secure shopping system is made up of three layers:</p>
	<p>The first layer "Safe Technology" is the most visible to you. Our Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology is the industry standard and among the best software available today to transmit sensitive information. SSL is a transport level technology for authentication and data encryption between a Web server and a Web browser. VeriSign, Inc. has protected every secure page on our site with a digital certificate. We encrypt all of your personal information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the Internet.</p>
	<p>The second layer, our "Firewall", works behind the scenes. We protect all of your private information behind a network security system. Only our own staff has access to this information, and then only enough to service your order.</p>
	<p>As a final precaution, we authorize all credit card transactions through the same private channel that we use for traditional orders.</p>
	<p>If you have any questions about our security system, please contact us.</p>

	<h3>Potential Future Modifications</h3>
	<p>This Security Policy was last updated on September 1, 2004. The Walking Company reserves the right to change, modify or amend this policy at any time. Use of this website after modification implies that you consent to this Security Policy as modified.</p>
