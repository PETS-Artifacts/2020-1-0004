		<h3>How we may access and use your personal and medical records</h3>
		<p>We have powers under the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/14/contents" target="_blank">Health and Social Care Act 2008</a> to access and use information – including personal and medical records – where we consider this is necessary for us to carry out our functions as a regulator. We also have powers to access and use information as part of our role protecting the rights of people whose rights are restricted under the Mental Health Act 1983, and powers under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.</p>
		<p>For example, we check that care services are complying with the regulations regarding record keeping, care planning, consent, cooperating with other providers, and management of medicines.</p>
		<p>We publish our guidance for our staff on accessing medical and care records. We usually look at only a small sample of these records during an inspection, often in anonymised form. In rare circumstances we may take a copy of parts of a person’s records.</p>
		<p>If you do not want us to look at your personal information when we check services, tell your care provider. They can mark your records to show that you do not want us to see them.</p>
		<p>If we know that you don’t want us to look at your information, we will respect your wishes, other than in rare circumstances which are explained in our Code of Practice on Confidential Personal Information.</p>
		<h3>Other information we receive from care services</h3>
		<p>Registered providers and managers of care services must tell us about certain events and incidents, including where they have received allegations of abuse, or where someone using the service is seriously injured. Care services also provide us with statistics including the number of complaints they have received.</p>
		<p>This information will usually be anonymous, but we may ask for more information if there are concerns or issues that we need to explore further.</p>
		<p>We sometimes look at records containing personal data, such as records relating to the handling of complaints. We do this to check how those services comply with their responsibilities.</p>
		<p>We sometimes ask care providers for contact details of people who use their services so that we can seek their views as part of our inspection. If you don’t want us to contact you in this way, please tell your care provider.</p>
		<h3>Personal data that we receive from other sources</h3>
		<p>We receive information from people who use the services we regulate, their families, friends and carers. For example, we ask people to <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/sye">share their experiences of care</a> with us. We also talk to people during inspections and receive letters, emails, telephone calls, comment cards and survey responses in which people tell us about care. These often contain personal data.</p>
		<p>We also receive information that sometimes contains personal data from other sources, such as NHS England, other regulators, councils and the police.</p>
		<p>We use this information to help us decide when, where and what to inspect, and to help us make our judgements when we inspect services.</p>
		<h3>Data and statistics</h3>
		<p>We receive data about organisations’ quality of care from NHS Digital, the trusted national provider of high-quality information, data and IT systems for health and social care.</p>
		<p>We use three sources of data that contain personal information:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/hes" target="_blank">Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)</a>,&nbsp;</li>
			<li><a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/mhsds" target="_blank">Mental Health data</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/onsmortality" target="_blank">Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Find more information about what we hold and how we use these sources on the <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/dataregister" target="_blank">NHS Digital registers of approved data releases</a>.</p>
		<h4>What data do we hold from NHS Digital that could potentially identify someone?</h4>
		<p>The data we hold include the following NHS Digital identifiable items:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>date of birth (patient),</li>
			<li>local patient identifier,</li>
			<li>postcode of patient,</li>
			<li>mother’s date of birth (in relation to maternity data),</li>
			<li>NHS number,</li>
			<li>birth date (baby, in relation to maternity data),</li>
			<li>date of death</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some of this information is unique to a person (NHS Number, local patient identifier), and others cannot uniquely identify a person (e.g. a postcode), but all data is stored and processed with the same robust security applied to identifiable data.</p>
		<p>We need this information to help meet our purpose of ensuring safe, effective and compassionate, high-quality care. For example, we may compare death rates at different hospitals, look for unusually high infection rates, and check for appropriate use of the Mental Health Act.</p>
		<p>NHS Digital send us this information because we meet their strict requirements on keeping it secure and only using it in a way that supports our work. Our powers under the Health and Social Care Act 2008 allow us to require NHS Digital to provide us with this information. <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/what-we-do/how-we-use-information/using-data-monitor-services">Find out more about how we use data to monitor services</a>.</p>
		<h4>Could others identify individuals from the data?</h4>
		<p>We may have to raise questions or concerns with a hospital directly; for example, if we are concerned about a hospital's death rates. This only happens in exceptional circumstances.</p>
		<p>Under agreement of NHS Digital, we may send codes (hospital numbers) to the hospital to allow them to review their own medical records identifying specific patients to see if their care had been lacking in some way. These codes originate from the hospital and can only be used by hospital staff to identify patients who have been treated at that hospital. We always treat these codes with the utmost care, and we will never attempt to link this data with individuals’ names.</p>
		<p><strong>National data opt-out policy</strong></p>
		<p>CQC has legal powers to obtain information, including patient-identifiable data, that we need to carry out our role. The national data opt-out policy does not allow NHS service users to opt-out of the use of data where such powers are set out in law. CQC may still access your information if you have registered a national data opt-out. CQC is subject to strict, legal restrictions on the disclosure of confidential personal information. This is in compliance with the national data opt-out policy. Find out more about the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/your-nhs-data-matters/" target="_blank">national data opt-out programme</a>.</p>
		<h3>Publishing information</h3>
		<p>We take care to ensure that our inspection reports and other publications do not identify people who use care services.</p>
		<p>In some exceptional circumstances (for example, where a service is used by only a very small number of people) someone mentioned in a report could be identified. Where we think this may happen we will take care to include only the minimum necessary personal information, and we will discuss this with the person (or their family or representatives) before publication.</p>

<div class="accordion-large" id="providers">
	<h2 class="accordion-title">Information about care providers, registered persons, and people who work at care services</h2>
	<div class="accordion-wrapper">
		<p>To carry out our role, we need personal data about people who provide, manage and work at care services.</p>
		<p>The personal data that we obtain and use mainly relates to ‘registered persons’ (people who are registered with us to provide or manage services) ‘nominated individuals’ (senior persons within provider organisations who represent them in their dealings with CQC), and senior management who control the organisations we register. However, in the course of our work, we do obtain and use some information about other people who work for, with, or at those services too.</p>
		<h3>Applications to register</h3>
		<p>Anyone applying to be a ‘registered person’ will be asked to submit an application form. Applications are also submitted by organisations wishing to be registered.</p>
		<p>We may also collect additional personal data, for example through interviews, by asking them to undertake <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service" target="_blank">Disclosure and Barring Service</a> (DBS) checks, or through our partner organisations or publicly available sources.</p>
		<p>This personal data will be used to make decisions regarding registration and may also be used in the course of our subsequent regulation of the services they provide or manage.</p>
		<p>We may share personal data we obtain in the course of our activities with other organisations where we need to do this to carry out our role, or to assist those bodies in their roles. For example, we may make referrals to the DBS or professional regulators, or may share information with NHS England, NHS Improvement or service commissioners or other regulatory bodies to assist them in their work.</p>
		<p>We are required to publish a register of providers and managers of the services we regulate. Entries on this register can be viewed by searching our website. The published register includes the names of registered providers and managers, and of nominated individuals, along with contact details.</p>
		<h3>Email addresses</h3>
		<p>We ask providers and managers for email addresses so we can contact them for reasons relating to our role – for example, to send official notices, to request information that we need, or to share relevant guidance and information.</p>
		<p>These email addresses do not form part of the public register and are not published.</p>
		<p>We may share these email addresses with other public bodies where there is a lawful and legitimate reason to do so. We will not share email addresses with private organisations or for marketing purposes.</p>
		<h3>People who work at care services</h3>
		<p>In the course of our work, we do obtain some information about people who work at care services. For example, we sometimes look at training records or evidence of recruitment checks as part of our inspection of a care service.</p>
		<p>We sometimes ask for staff contact details so that we can ask them about the services where they work.</p>
		<p>Our inspection powers allow us to interview any person who works for a registered care provider in private. We take notes of these interviews and use the information that we receive to guide our inspections and make our regulatory judgements.</p>
		<p>People who work for registered providers may also contact us to share concerns about services, or other information that may assist us in our work. <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/contact-us/report-concern/report-concern-if-you-are-member-staff">Find out more about raising concerns about services where you work</a>.</p>
		<p>We consider the records of interviews, and other information we receive from people who work at care services, to be confidential, and we handle this information in accordance withdata protection law and our Code of Practice on Confidential Personal Information. There may be times when we need to share this information with others. This includes where we believe a vulnerable person is at risk of harm, or when another organisation needs to take action to ensure the safety and quality of care.</p>

<div class="accordion-large" id="staff">
	<h2 class="accordion-title">Information about our own staff and people applying to work for or with us</h2>
	<div class="accordion-wrapper">
		<p>We need to process personal data about our own staff (and people applying to work for us) so that we can carry out our role (for example, by ensuring that we have the right staff to perform our inspections) and so we can meet our legal and contractual responsibilities as an employer.</p>
		<p>The personal data that we process includes information about racial or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender and sexuality. We use this information to check we are promoting and ensuring diversity in our workforce and to make sure we are complying with equalities legislation.</p>
		<p>Our employees decide whether or not to share this monitoring data with us, and can choose to withdraw their consent for this at any time. Employees who wish to withdraw their consent for us to process this data can contact the HR team.</p>
		<p>Other personal data that we are required to process includes information on qualifications and experience, pay and performance, contact details, bank details, and service records (including records of continuous service and pension contributions/entitlements).</p>
		<p>We check that people who work for us are fit and suitable for their roles. This may include asking people to undertake <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/disclosure-and-barring-service" target="_blank">Disclosure and Barring Service</a> (DBS) checks.</p>
		<p>People joining CQC will be asked to complete a ‘declaration of interests’ form to identify any services we regulate to which they have close links (for example, because they have previously worked there or because the service is run by a close relative) or any other issues which could cause a perceived conflict of interest. Staff are regularly asked to update these forms.</p>
		<p>We share information about our employees as required to meet our contractual obligations to them – for example, by sharing relevant personal data with pension service administrators. We also share personal data where required by law – for example, by providing information about our employees to HMRC.</p>
		<p>We have a legal obligation to comply with the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and this may include the requirement to disclose some information about our employees – especially those in senior or public facing roles. We also publish some information about our staff, including the names and work contact details of people in some roles and information on the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/transparency/salaries-structure-staff">salary bands of all employees</a>.</p>

<h3>How we share information with other organisations</h3>
<p>We publish <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/our-partnerships/partnerships-other-organisations">information about how we work with other organisations</a>.</p>
<p>We only share personal data with other organisations where it is lawful to do so and in accordance with our Code of Practice on Confidential Personal Information. We do not use personal data for direct marketing (promoting or selling goods, services etc.) or share information with anyone else who will use it for direct marketing, unless you have specifically consented to this.</p>
<p>We sometimes use other organisations to process personal data on our behalf. Where we do this, those companies are required to follow the same rules and information security requirements as us, and are not permitted to reuse the data for other purposes.</p>
<p>We work with <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/jobs/experts-experience">Experts by Experience</a>, Mental Health Reviewers and Specialist Advisors who are not employees of CQC, but who work with our inspection teams. We also coordinate the work of Second Opinion Appointed Doctors who provide an independent medical opinion for people whose rights are restricted under the Mental Health Act. We sometimes need to share personal data with these people, or with the organisations that support them on our behalf. For example, passing contact details of someone who has contacted CQC to an Expert by Experience so that they can telephone them to discuss their care. They work to our requirements and standards to ensure that they protect this information properly.</p>
<h3>Retention and disposal of personal data</h3>
<p>We publish a <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/about-us/our-policies/freedom-information-data-protection">retention and disposal schedule</a> which explains how long we keep different types of records and documents for, including records and documents containing personal data. Personal data is deleted or securely destroyed at the end of its retention period.</p>
<p>This document also shows the legal basis under Article 6 of GDPR for processing each type of record and document. Where records and documents contain ‘special category’ personal data (such as health information, or information about a person’s racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or sex life or sexuality), the document also shows the legal basis under Article 9 for CQC’s processing of that information.</p>
<div class="accordion-large" id="rights">
	<h2 class="accordion-title">Your rights</h2>
	<div class="accordion-wrapper">
		<h3>Your right to access information about you</h3>

			<li>You object to our holding and use of your personal data, and we do not have an overriding reason why we need to keep doing so, or</li>
			<li>We have processed your personal data unlawfully.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will usually respond to you within one month to inform you of the action we have taken. If we need to refuse your request to correct your personal data, we will explain the reasons for this to you.</p>
		<h3>Restricting, or objecting to, how we use your personal data</h3>
		<p>You have the right to ask CQC not to process your personal data in ways which you object to – for example, not to share it with anyone.</p>
		<p>You can do this where you feel that the personal data is inaccurate, has been unlawfully processed by CQC and you object to its erasure, or is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was originally obtained but you require it for the conduct of legal proceedings.</p>
		<p>You can also object to our processing of your personal data, on grounds relating to your particular situation.</p>
		<p>We will usually respond to you within one month to inform you of the action we have taken. If we need to refuse your request to correct your personal data, we will explain the reasons for this to you.</p>
