and other content and interactive and informational resources (collectively,
“Services”). This Privacy Policy sets forth our policies with respect to information
including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information
that is collected from you when using the Site. Unless otherwise stated in this
Privacy Policy, this policy shall be deemed to apply to us and all references
to “we”, “us” and/or “our” shall include our Service Provider.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>
	When you interact with
us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from
you, as further described below:
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site</strong></h3>
<p>

voluntarily choose to provide such information such as when you, including:
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Your information</strong> is the information that’s required when you sign up for the

address and sport.In some cases, you
may be able to register using other information such as your TGR account.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Information you choose to share:</strong> Your information also includes information you
choose to share on TGR, such as when you post an update, upload a photo,
comment on a friend’s story, contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our
surveys, register for access to the Services or use certain Services. It also includes the

Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy. By voluntarily providing us with Personal
Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy
Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree
that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to our or
our Service Provider’s offices and servers.
</p>
<p>
	Your
name, profile pictures, cover photos, sports, username and User ID are treated
just like information you choose to make public.
</p>
<h3>
<strong>Public Information</strong></h3>
<p>
	<strong>Information that is always publicly available</strong>
</p>
<p>
	The
types of information listed below are always publicly available, and they are
treated just like information you decided to make public:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>
	Name:</strong> This helps your friends and
family find you. If you are uncomfortable sharing your real name, you can
always 
	<a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/contact.php?show_form=delete_account"><u>delete</u></a> your account.</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Profile Pictures and Cover
Photos:
	</strong>
	These help your friends and family recognize you. If you are uncomfortable
making any of these photos public, you can always delete them. Unless you
delete them, when you add a new profile picture or cover photo, the previous
photo will remain public in your profile picture or cover photo album.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Gender:</strong> This allows us to refer to
you properly.
	</li>
	<li>
	<strong>Username and User ID</strong>: These allow you to give out
a custom link to your Profile Page and help make TGR Platform possible.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<strong>Usernames and User IDs</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Usernames
and User IDs are the same thing – a way to identify you on TGR. A User ID is a
string of numbers and a username generally is some variation of your name. With
your username, you get a custom link that you can give out to people or post on
external websites.
</p>
<p>
	If
someone has your Username or User ID, they can use it to access information
about you through the tetongravity.com website. For example, if someone has
your Username, they can type tetongravity.com/Username into their browser and
see your public information as well as anything else you've let them see.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>How we use the information we
receive
	</strong>
</p>
<p>
	We
use the information we receive about you in connection with the services and
features we provide to you and other users like your friends, our partners, the
advertisers that purchase ads on the site, developers, applications, and
websites you use. For example, in addition to helping people see and find
things that you do and share, we may use the information we receive about you:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	as part of our efforts to
keep TGR products, services and integrations safe and secure;
	</li>
	<li>
	to protect TGR's or others'
rights or property;
	</li>
	<li>
	to provide you with location
features and services, like telling you and your friends when something is
going on nearby;
	</li>
	<li>
	to measure or understand the
effectiveness of ads you and others see, including to deliver relevant ads to
you;
	</li>
	<li>
	to make suggestions to you
and other users on TGR, such as: suggesting that your friend like the same
sports or activities
	</li>
	<li>
	for internal operations,
including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research and service
improvement.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Granting
us permission to use your information not only allows us to provide TGR as it exists today, but it
also allows us to provide you with innovative features and services we develop
in the future that use the information we receive about you in new ways.
</p>
<p>
	While
you are allowing us to use the information we receive about you, you always own
all of your information. Your trust is important to us, which is why we don't

<h3>RISK OF LOSS</h3>
<p>
	All items purchased from TGR are made pursuant to a shipment contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for such items pass to you upon our delivery to the carrier.
</p>
<h3>RETURNS, REFUNDS AND TITLE</h3>
<p>
	TGR does not take title to returned items until the item arrives at our fulfillment center. At our discretion, a refund may be issued without requiring a return. In this situation, Amazon does not take title to the refunded item. For more information about our returns and refunds, please see our Returns Center
</p>
<h3>PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS</h3>
<p>
	TGR attempts to be as accurate as possible. However, TGR does not warrant that product descriptions or other content of any TGR Service is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free. If a product offered by TGR itself is not as described, your sole remedy is to return it in unused condition.

<p>
	Except where noted otherwise, the List Price or Suggested Price displayed for products on any TGR represents the full retail price listed on the product itself, suggested by the manufacturer or supplier, or estimated in accordance with standard industry practice; or the estimated retail value for a comparably featured item offered elsewhere. The List Price or Suggested Price is a comparative price estimate and may or may not represent the prevailing price in every area on any particular day. For certain items that are offered as a set, the List Price or Suggested Price may represent "open-stock" prices, which means the aggregate of the manufacturer's estimated or suggested retail price for each of the items included in the set.
</p>

	With respect to items sold by TGR, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced.

Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item.
