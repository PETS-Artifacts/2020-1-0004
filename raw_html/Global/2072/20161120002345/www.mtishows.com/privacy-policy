The Site collects precise information about the geographic location of your device.  If your device is equipped with GPS or can connect with wireless access points or hot spots, or if your device is also a phone that communicates with cell towers or satellites, then your device is able to use these features to determine its precise geographic location.  If you have consented using your device's user interface, the geographic location of your device will be transmitted to our servers in real time any time that the Site is running (even if you are not actively using the Site or it is minimized on your device).  Once you set your device to transmit its location information to us, your device will continue to transmit its location information to us (when the Site is running) until you set your device to no longer do so.<br /><br />
We use your location information to present you with user-localized maps for shows or Community Marketplace Items near you. We receive your location when you interact with the Site.<br /><br />
You may at any time opt-out from further allowing us to have access to your device's location information by accessing the Site's location settings on your device and setting your device not to share its location with us.<br /><br />
If you set your device to not transmit its location information to us, you will have to manually enter your location of interest when conducting searches for shows or Community Marketplace using the Site. Certain features may not function if you set your device to not transmit location information to us.<br /><br /><strong><em>Site Usage Information</em></strong><br /><br />
We collect the browser type and IP address of all Site visitors. We may also capture certain "clickstream data" pertaining to your Site usage.  Clickstream data includes, for example, the referring page that linked Users to the Site (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages Users visit on this Site; the Web site Users visit after this Site; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings Users are using; any search terms Users have entered on this Site or a referral site; the pages, content or ads you see or click on during your visit and when and for how long you do so, items you download and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers.  Among other things, this information enables us to generate analytics reports on the usage of our Site.  To opt-out of your Site usage being included in our Google analytics reports, you may follow the instructions at [<a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout]">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout]</a>.<br /><br />
In addition, we may deploy various tracking technologies on the Site to collect additional information about your Site visits.  For example:</p>

<ul><li>Cookies are small data files stored on your computer or device at the request of a Web site.  A cookie assigns a unique numerical identifier to your Web browser, and may enable us to recognize you as the same user who was at our Site in the past, and relate your use of the Site to other information about you, such as your Site usage information and personal information.  Cookies may also be used to enhance your experience on the Site (for example, by storing your username so you can log in easily, keeping you logged into the Site after you have provided your password, and storing the contents of your shopping cart as you browse) or to collect general usage and aggregated statistical information and detect and prevent fraud.  Most browsers can be set to detect cookies and give you an opportunity to reject them, but refusing cookies may, in some cases, inhibit or preclude your use of the Site or its features.  To learn more about the use of cookies, including how to manage or delete them, go to [<a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/]">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/]</a>.</li>
	<li>HTML5 (the language some Web sites are coded in) may be used to store information on your computer or device about your Site usage activities.  This information can be retrieved by us to determine how our Site is being used by our visitors, how it can be improved, and to customize it for our users.</li>
	<li>Cache cookies, such as eTags, may be used to identify your computer or device as the same computer or device that visited our Website or another web site in the past.</li>
	<li>A pixel tag (also known as a "clear GIF" or "web beacon") is a tiny image – typically just one-pixel – that can be placed on a Web page or in our electronic communications to you in order to help us measure the effectiveness of our content by, for example, counting the number of individuals who visit us online or verifying whether you've opened one of our emails or seen one of our web pages.</li>
</ul><p>These tracking technologies may be deployed by us and/or by our service providers or partners on our behalf. These technologies enable us to assign a unique number to you, and relate your site usage information to other information about you, including your Personal Information.<br /><br /><strong>By using the Site, you consent to our use of these tracking technologies as described above.</strong><br /><br /><strong><em>Information Obtained from Third Parties</em></strong><br /><br />
We may supplement the information obtained from you with information that is received or otherwise obtained from third parties. For example, this information may be received or obtained from our partners in sponsored content sections or from other third parties. The type of information that is shared with us could include, for example, user contact information (like name and email address) and user demographic information (like zip code, age or income level), as well as other types of personal information and non-personally identifiable information. We will use such supplemental information received or obtained from third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  <br /><br /><strong>Do Not Track Disclosures</strong><br /><br />
Some web browsers may transmit "do-not-track" (DNT) signals to the websites with which the user communicates.  Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they even are aware of them.  Because there currently is no industry standard concerning what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals, we currently do not change our tracking practices (which are explained in more detail directly above) in response to DNT settings in your web browser. If and when a final standard is established and accepted, we will reassess how to respond to these signals.<br /><br />
Our third party partners, such as ad networks, web analytics companies and social media and networking platforms, collect information about your online activities over time and across our Site and other online properties. These third parties do not change their tracking practices in response to DNT settings in your web browser and we do not obligate these parties to honor DNT settings.  We utilize Google analytics for our web analytics and you can opt out from your data being used by Google Analytics by visiting <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. See the discussion above under "Third Party Ad Services and Providers"<strong> </strong>regarding how to opt out of internet-based behavioral advertising.<br /><br /><strong>How is your information used?</strong><br /><br />

We or our service providers may also use your information to assess the level of interest in, and use of, the Site, our e-mails and our other messaging campaigns both on an individual basis and in the aggregate. <br /><br /><strong>Do we share your information with third parties?</strong><br /><br />

In addition, we may share non-personally identifiable Site Usage Information (including aggregate data) with others, for their own use, in a form that does not include your name or contact information.<br /><br />
Third Party Marketers:  We may provide our Users with an opportunity to receive offers from third parties who have services, products and offers that we think might be of interest to them, and we will do so by sharing the User's information with such third parties.  You can elect for us not to do so by following the directions in the ["Opt In/Opt Out"]<br /><br />
