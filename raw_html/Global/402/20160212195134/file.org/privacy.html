<h3>Aggregate Information We Collect</h3>
<p>
When you use our Services, we may collect tracking information such as your IP address, browser type, the type of operating system you use, the domain name of your Internet service provider, and pages you visited on our Sites. None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to Personally Identifiable Information.<br />
<br />
Cookies. A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes. We and our Partners use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie will terminate. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's help file.<br />
<br />
We use cookies to: 1) Estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing our Services is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage; 
2) Measure certain traffic patterns, for example which of our Sites you have visited. We use this information to understand our users' habits so that we can make each new experience on a Site a better one. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you will see. We do not store Personally Identifiable Information in our cookies and we do not tie the information in our cookies to our customers' Personally Identifiable Information<br />
<br />
Some of the Partner Ads on our Services may lead you to sites that also use cookies. We have no control over our partners' privacy policies. We also have no control over their cookies, the information collected and its use.
</p>


<h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
<p>
Our primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you, we and our Partners are able to deliver relevant Services and Ads.<br />
<br />
Research. We study users' demographics and interests using your information. We also use cookies and server log files to better understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We also may share this aggregated data periodically with current and potential Partners.<br />
<br />
Third Parties and Advertising. Third parties advertise on our Sites. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track Session Data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt-out of the third party advertising program by visiting the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp">Network Advertising Initiative website</a>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.<br />
<br />
When you click on a third party advertisers' link from our Site, you will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party's sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.<br />
</p>


<h3>How We Share Your Information</h3>
<p>
The following describes some of the ways that we may disclose your information to our Partners:<br />
<br />
Legal Disclosure. We may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose user information, as required by law, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a judicial procedure served on our sites; or if the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our Products and Services.<br />
<br />
Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business kcdn. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the Services would be one of the transferred kcdn.<br />
<br />
If you click an Ad, the partner who advertised on our site will get information about which site you clicked the Ad on, and which Ad it was. We transfer no additional information that we have collected to the Partner.
</p>


<h3>Your Choices</h3>
<p>
Cookies. By modifying your browser preferences, you can choose to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or you can reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you may be unable to use our Services.<br />
</p>

<p>A file extension is the characters after the last dot in a file name. For example, in the file name "winmail.dat", the file extension is "dat". It helps Windows select the right program to open the file.</p>
</li>
<li><h2>We help you open your file</h2>
<p>We have a huge database of file extensions (file types) with detailed descriptions. We hand pick programs that we know can open or otherwise handle each specific type of file.</p>
</li>
<li class="last_list"><h2>Original downloads only</h2>
<p>All software listed on file.org is hosted and delivered directly by the manufacturers. We do not host downloads on our own, but point you to the newest, original downloads.</p></li>
