                                    <p>Where we collect your personal information from  someone other than you, it is generally because you have made a booking through  one of our agents or partners, or we are required to by law.

                                    <p>As the Rex Group is required by law to  obtain your consent to the collection of â€˜sensitive informationâ€™ relevant for  your travel arrangements,Â  we will assume  that you have consented to the collection of all information (including  sensitive information) which is provided to us for use in accordance with this  RGPP, unless you have informed us otherwise.

                                      Another example would be if you have a  health condition which means you will need some assistance with boarding; we  will collect information about this from you, however you must give your  consent first. If we need to use or disclose your personal information for a  purpose that is not set out in our RGPP, or that is otherwise unrelated to the  purpose for which we collected your personal information, we will obtain your  consent first.<br /><br />
                                      There are some circumstances where we  may not need your consent, and these are set out in the Privacy Act.

We also use internet-based marketing including <a class="tblhyplink" href="#CAWT">targeted online advertising and online behavioural  marketing</a> however,  in all such cases, you will be given the option of not receiving further  communications of that nature.Â  We will  not use your health information or other sensitive information that we hold  about you for marketing purposes, without your consent.<br /><br />
                                      You have the right to request not to  receive direct marketing communications from us, or request us to provide our  source of your personal information.Â  You  can let us know at any time if you no longer wish to receive marketing  materials from us, our related entities or our partners. The Rex Group will comply  with these requests within a reasonable period and free of charge.<br /><br />
                                      We will assume that, unless you tell  us otherwise, you consent to the collection of the information that you provide  to us (either directly or indirectly) for the use and disclosure by us in  accordance with this RGPP.</p>

                                      Your passport or driversâ€™ licence number  are known as â€˜government related identifiersâ€™.Â   We only use these numbers to verify your identity when you are  travelling with us. Â We may need to  disclose these details to law enforcement agencies or if we are otherwise  required to do so by law or court order. You will not be uniquely identified in  our systems by these identifiers.Â  </p>

                                    <p><strong>9. Holding  and Keeping Personal Information Safe</strong><br />
                                      The Rex Group mostly holds personal  information electronically (including telephone recordings and emails) in our  IT systems and databases. The Rex Group takes reasonable steps to protect  information that we hold about you from misuse, interference and loss, and from  unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We do this by having physical  and electronic security systems and by limiting who can access your personal  information. We also have online and network security systems in place for our  websites, so that the information you provide us online is protected and  secure. <br /><br />
                                      The following is a description of the  website security we deploy. The Rex Group website and its subsidiary Company  websites use Secure Sockets Layer (â€˜SSLâ€™) encryption technology which can help  prevent unauthorised third parties intercepting information passing between the  Regional Express website and your browser. If encrypted transmission is  indicated, Rex currently uses 256 bit SSL encryption. Your browser should  indicate whether the information you are sending Rex is encrypted or  unencrypted. <br /><br />
                                      SSL enabled web pages can be identified by  their URL: they begin with 'https://'. In contrast, standard pages generally  begin with 'http://'. <br /><br />
                                      Due to the nature of the internet, no one,  including the Rex Group, can guarantee that data passing over the Internet  cannot be intercepted or used by unauthorised third parties. Accordingly,  although the Rex Group works hard to protect that information, it cannot ensure  or warrant the security of any information you transmit to it and will not be  responsible for any events arising from unauthorised access to the information  you provide. Once the Rex Group receives information that you have transmitted  to it, the Rex Group will take reasonable steps to preserve the security of  that information in its own systems. Please contact us if you become aware of  any breach of security.<br /><br />
                                      In the event we receive information that the Rex Group did not  intend to collect, or if the Rex Group determines that we no longer need that  information, it would be destroyed or de-identified if it is not contained in a  Commonwealth record and if no longer needed for a lawful purpose under the  APPs.</p>

                                    <p><strong>10. Accessing  and Updating Personal Information</strong> <br />
                                      We try to ensure the information that we  hold about you is accurate, complete, relevant and up-to-date. We do this by  regularly reviewing our customer databases and updating or removing out-of-date,  misleading or incorrect data. Please help us to do this by letting us know if  your details change or we send you an email or letter that contains incorrect  details. You have a right to request access and correct the personal  information that we hold about you. If you would like to check that the  information we hold about you is correct, find out about what information we  hold about you, or make a correction, please contact us, either by calling our  Customer Contact Centre or making an online request. The Rex Group, upon  request, will provide you with access to your personal information, or if the  personal information it holds about you is inaccurate, incomplete or  out-of-date, it will update or correct it upon you contacting us. The Rex Group  may require personal identification so that we can respond to your request. We  cannot give you information about other people. Please click <a href="http://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/privacy-resources/privacy-fact-sheets/other/privacy-fact-sheet-17-australian-privacy-principles" target="_blank">here</a> to read about exceptions.<br /><br />
                                      Sometimes we will be able to respond to  your query over the phone, but sometimes we may need your request in writing  and we might need some time to gather the requested information and get back to  you. The more complex requests will take approximately 30 days for a response.  We might need to send a copy of the information to you by post or we might ask  you to come and see us to have a look at the information. <br /><br />
                                      Making a request is free, but depending on  what information you request access to, we may recover from you reasonable  costs of supplying you with access to the information. The charges will not be  excessive and we will let you know if a charge is applicable before we proceed  with giving you access. There is no charge for updating or correcting your  personal information. <br /><br />
                                      There may be reasons that we cannot provide  you with access to the personal information, or we refuse to correct your  personal information. If this is the case, we will provide you with reasons for  the refusal in writing, and inform you of any exceptions relied upon under the  Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), including the APPs. If the Rex Group refuses to correct  your personal information that we hold, you can ask us to associate with that  information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date,  irrelevant or misleading. We will take reasonable steps to associate this  statement with your personal information that we hold so that users of the  information are aware of it; or if we refuse you access to your personal  information, you can make a complaint about this by following the complaint procedures  in this RGPP.<br /><br />
                                      If we update information that we hold about  you, and we have given this information to a third party, then we will take  reasonable steps to ask that third party to also update the information that it  holds about you.<br /><br />
