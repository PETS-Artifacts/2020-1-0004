<h2>Certain Exceptional Disclosures</h2>
<p>We may disclose your information if necessary to protect our legal rights or if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct. Disclosure may be required by law or if we receive legal process.</p>
<h2>What Are Cookies? Why Do We Use Them?</h2>
<p>Cookies are small files stored by your browser in your computer when you visit our Site. We use cookies to improve our Site and make it easier to use. Cookies permit us to recognize users and avoid repetitive requests for the same information. We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use to individualize your visits. This profile is not linked to your personal identity. We also use cookies to help build a pseudonymous profile of your online habits, interests and activities as you navigate our site, which we use for general research, analysis and reporting. We mostly use &#8220;session cookies&#8221; that are automatically deleted after each visit. Cookies from our Site can&#8217;t be read by other sites. Most browsers will accept cookies until you change browser settings to refuse them.</p>
<h2>How Do We Protect Information We Collect?</h2>
<p>We offer secure web pages to collect certain kinds of user information and we store certain kinds of data in encrypted form. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by our Site reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
<h2>How Long Do We Keep User Information?</h2>
<p>We generally keep user data on our server or in our archives for as long as we reasonably need it. We may alter this practice according to changing requirements. For example, we may delete some data if needed to free up storage space. We may keep other data for longer periods if the law requires it. In addition, information posted in a public forum could stay in the public domain indefinitely.</p>
<p>Data management requests are administered in an orderly manner to the extent feasible and within our direct control. Note: we have greater control over recently collected data than for archived data. Once data is removed from the system and archived, it may not be feasible to accommodate specific requests. In those cases, our general data retention policy applies.</p>
<h2>Your Consent to This Policy</h2>
<p>By using our Site, you agree to this Policy. This is our entire and exclusive Privacy Policy and it supersedes any earlier version. Our Terms of Service take precedence over any conflicting Policy provision. We may change our Policy by posting a new version on our Site.</p>
<h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
<p>This Site operates AS-IS and AS-AVAILABLE, without liability of any kind. We are not responsible for events beyond our direct control. This Policy is governed by Trinidad &amp; Tobago law, excluding conflicts of law principles. Any legal actions against us must be commenced in the country of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, within one year after the claim arose, or be barred.</p>
