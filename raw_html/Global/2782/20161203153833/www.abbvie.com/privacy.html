<h3><u>Providing Programs and Services You Request</u></h3>

<h3><u>Marketing</u></h3>

In such cases, we will use your contact and other Personal Information to send you marketing information.</p>
<h3><u>Customized User Experiences</u></h3>
<p>The Personal Information that you provide may be used to create customized offers, information, or services tailored to your interests and preferences. Also, we may use your IP address and the data that we obtain automatically through the use of cookies or similar tracking technologies to make our AbbVie Sites easier to use and navigate as well as to personalize the content provided on AbbVie Sites by anticipating the information and services that may be of interest to you.</p>

<div class="text"><h2><a name="when-share-info"></a>WHEN WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h2>
<p>We only share your Personal Information with third parties as described below. We do not sell or rent Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>
<h3><u>Third-Party Advertising and Online Behavioral Advertising <br>
</u></h3>
<p>You may be provided with online advertisements of AbbVie products and services on third-party websites and mobile services that are tailored to you, for example, on the basis of information that you provide to AbbVie or a third-party website you are visiting, or of your browsing activity, purchases, or interests. These types of tailored online advertisements may come through several sources, such as the following:<br>
</p>
<ul>
<li>We may share with our advertising service providers your non-identifying information that we have obtained from cookies and other tracking technologies on our AbbVie Sites.</li>
<li>Some AbbVie Sites participate in online behavioral advertising (this is also sometimes called re-target advertising or interest-based advertising). You can identify these sites by the “Advertising Choices” link in the footer. Our advertising network partners may place and use cookies on AbbVie Web sites and on other third-party Web sites to collect information about your activities in order to provide you with online advertisements that are based on your interests. When an AbbVie online behavioral advertisement is delivered to you, you will see an “Ad Choices” icon. Clicking on the icon or link will take you to a Web site where you can manage or opt out of the use of data about your browsing history that is used for the delivery of online behavioral advertisements. If you opt out, you may still see advertisements online, including advertisements from AbbVie that are based on other information (e.g., based on the content of the page being viewed rather than your prior clickstream activity). In some cases, data may still be collected about your browsing activity by these third-party advertisers, but they will not use this data to deliver advertisements that are based on your past online browsing behavior. You can also opt out now by clicking <a adhocenable="false" href="https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&amp;nt=0&amp;nw=true" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Some Web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to Web sites with which the browser communicates. As of the Effective Date of this Privacy Notice, an industry standard has not yet been established on how to respond to these signals. Therefore, AbbVie does not currently respond to these signals. As discussed above, you can opt-out from advertisers that use your browsing history to deliver online behavioral advertisements by visiting&nbsp;<a adhocenable="false" href="https://info.evidon.com/pub_info/6678?v=1&amp;nt=0&amp;nw=true" target="_blank">adchoices</a>.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>Affiliates, Vendors and Suppliers</u></h3>
<p>We have relationships with various vendors and suppliers, including our affiliated companies, who help us operate our business and for whom it may be necessary to have access to your Personal Information in the course of providing services to AbbVie. We will not authorize these parties to use your Personal Information for any purpose that is not related to AbbVie’s business operation, and we require them to handle your Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Sites in accordance with this Privacy Notice.<br>
</p>
<h3><u>Co-branded Sites</u></h3>
<p>We may partner with other companies to provide you with content or services on a joint or “co-branded” basis. At a co‑branded site, you will see both the AbbVie logo and the logo of the co-branding partner displayed on your screen. To access the services available on a co-branded site, you may have to complete a new online registration form, and this registration information may be shared with AbbVie’s co-branding partners. You should read the individual privacy policies of our co-branding partners, as they may differ in some respects from ours. Reading these policies will help you to make an informed decision about whether to provide your information to a given site.</p>
<h3><u>Product Reports</u></h3>
<p>If you contact AbbVie regarding your experience in using one of our products, we may use the information that you provide in submitting reports to the US Food and Drug Administration and as otherwise required of us by law. We also may use the information to contact the prescribing physician to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of our product.</p>
<h3><u>Legal Rights and Obligations</u></h3>
<p>In certain limited circumstances, AbbVie may need to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with a legal obligation or demand, such as to comply with reporting obligations to our governing regulatory authorities regarding the safety of our pharmaceutical products, or in connection with the sale or transfer of one of our product lines or divisions, which includes the services provided through one or more of the AbbVie Sites. In such instances, we will take measures to protect your Personal Information to the extent possible. We also reserve the right to use Personal Information to investigate and prosecute users who violate our rules or who engage in behavior that is illegal or harmful to others or to others’ property.<br>

<h2><a name="data-security"></a>DATA SECURITY</h2>
<p>AbbVie maintains reasonable technical, administrative and physical controls to secure any Personal Information collected through the AbbVie Sites. However, there is always some risk that an unauthorized third party could intercept an Internet transmission, or that someone will find a way to thwart our security systems. We urge you to exercise caution when transmitting Personal Information over the Internet, especially your health-related information. AbbVie cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not gain access to your Personal Information; therefore, when submitting Personal Information to AbbVie Sites, you must weigh both the benefits and the risks.</p>
<h2>LINKS TO THIRD PARTY SITES AND Social Media Plug-ins</h2>
<p>This Privacy Notice does not apply to AbbVie Sites that do not link to this Privacy Notice, or to third-party Web sites to which AbbVie Sites may link. AbbVie Sites may use social media plug-ins (e.g., the Facebook “Like” button, “Share to Twitter” button) to enable you to easily share information with others. When you visit AbbVie Sites, the operator of the social plug-in can place a cookie on your computer or other electronic device that enables that operator to recognize individuals who have previously visited our Site. If you are logged into the social media Web site (e.g., Facebook, Twitter) while browsing on our AbbVie Site, the social media plug-in allows that social media Web site to receive information that you have visited our AbbVie Site. The social media plug-in also allows the social media Web site to share information about your activities on our AbbVie Site with other users of their social media Web site. These sharing settings are managed by the social media Web site and governed by its privacy policy.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="website-visitors-us-int"></a>ACCESSING OUR SITES GLOBALLY</h2>
<p>This site is owned and operated by AbbVie in the United States, but the information you provide will be accessible to our affiliates, vendors, and suppliers in other countries. Furthermore, if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communication with us will necessarily result in the transfer of information across international borders. The level of legal protection for personal information is not the same in all countries; however, we will take the security measures described in this Privacy Notice in an effort to keep your information secure. By using this site, you consent to the collection, storage, and processing of your information in the United States and in any country to which we may transfer your information in the course of our business operations.<br>
</p>
<h2><a name="change-privacy"></a>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY notice</h2>
<p>We will only use Personal Information in the manner described in the Privacy Notice in effect when the information was collected from you or as authorized by you. However, and subject to any applicable consent requirements, we reserve the right to change the terms of this Privacy Notice at any time. Any changes to this Privacy Notice will be reflected on this page with a new effective date. AbbVie encourages you to review this Privacy Notice regularly for any changes. Any Personal Information collected upon your continued use of AbbVie Sites will be handled in accordance with the currently-posted Privacy Notice.<br>
