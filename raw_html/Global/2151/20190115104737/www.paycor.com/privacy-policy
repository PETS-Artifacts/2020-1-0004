    <h3>PRIVACY POLICY</h3>

<p>Paycor, Inc. values your privacy, and is committed to providing
exceptional client service and ease of mind that your business,
financial and/or personal information is secure. We use reasonable care
to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration, or destruction. We have created this privacy statement with
your privacy and security in mind. The following discloses the
information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site and
for Paycor&#39;s mobile applications. Where appropriate, references to &quot;this
site&quot;, &quot;our site&quot;, or &quot;our Web site&quot; include Paycor&#39;s mobile
applications. This Privacy Statement may be revised from time to time
without notice.</p>

<h4>COLLECTING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

<p>Personal information is only collected when the visitor submits it.
Generally, this information is requested when a visitor is asked to
register before entering a limited-access site, or when the visitor
requests information or contact from Paycor, Inc. The Client is
responsible for maintaining correct information required for payroll
processing.</p>

<h4>COOKIES</h4>

<p>In an effort to publish content visitors need and want, Paycor collects
summative site-visitation statistics using cookies. A cookie is a piece
of data that our Web site may provide to your browser or mobile device
while you are at our site. We do not track individuals’ use of the site.</p>

<p>When a user visits our site, a cookie is placed on the visitor&#39;s machine
(if the visitor accepts cookies) or is read if the visitor has accessed
the site previously.</p>

<p>We do not use this technology to develop or access personally
identifiable information about the visitor; it is a tool we use to
compile statistics about our web site and mobile applications usage. We
do not share this information outside of Paycor, and do not allow other
companies to place technology on our site that would develop personally
identifiable information.</p>

<p>If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the
paycor.com web site, you will be able to view the text and graphics in
the public web sites only. Limited-access sites require that the
visitor&#39;s browser accept cookies.</p>

<h4>EXTERNAL LINKS</h4>

<p>This site contains links to other sites. Paycor is not responsible for
the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.</p>

<h4>SECURITY</h4>

<p>This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse,
and alteration of the information under our control. We take a number of
security precautions to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of our
data. These precautions can be grouped as internal security and external
security. Both security groups define the individuals or groups who are
authorized to access and/or change data. This prevents unauthorized
individuals from accessing, copying, editing, or deleting private data.
We also implement an audit system that tracks access, both successful
and unsuccessful, to confidential data. This audit information is used
to constantly evaluate and refine our security measures and to identify
individuals who might attempt to inappropriately access data and to take
remedial action.</p>

<p>Paycor uses industry-standard 128-bit secure socket layer (SSL)
technology to encrypt and authenticate transactions. SSL creates a
secured connection between our web servicers and your browser, which
eliminates unauthorized access to transmitted data and ensures data is
sent only to the intended server.</p>
