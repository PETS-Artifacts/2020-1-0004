        <li>where this is necessary for legal obligations which apply to us.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3. How we use the Personal Information that you provide to us</h3>
      <p>We undertake the following processing of your Personal Information on the legal basis that it is necessary to perform the contract with you and to provide the services we have agreed to provide to you. Where we have not entered into a contract with you, we may also carry out this processing because in that pre-contractual stage where we consider it is necessary in our legitimate business interests in order to deal with requests, enquiries or comments you have made to us. </p>
      <p><strong>Pre-contract processing</strong> - we collect your Personal Information which you provide to us when applying for a service with us to comply with our legal obligations and to carry out fraud checks. We may also process your Personal Information for this purpose where we consider it necessary for performance of the contract with you, or otherwise with your consent.</p>
      <p><strong>Enhancing your experience and our business</strong> - we may use your Personal Information to administer our site and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes. We may also share limited Personal Information with social media platforms to provide you with tailored services relevant to the services you have requested or received.</p>
      <p><strong>Other lawfully permitted processing</strong> - We may also use any Personal Information that you provide to us for example to other companies within LCN or to other organisations required to provide you with the requested service. If you choose not to provide Personal Information requested by us, we may not be able to provide you with the services and/or information you have requested or otherwise fulfil the purpose(s) for which we have asked for the Personal Information.</p> 
      <p><strong>Marketing</strong> - where legally permitted to do so where you have provided us with your contact details and have agreed to be contacted for marketing purposes, we may contact you by telephone or by post for marketing purposes relating to our services, our website, and/or to research opinion on proposed business developments.

      <h3>4. How and when do we share information with third parties?</h3>
      <p>Some services that we provide require the involvement of third parties. We have carefully selected these third parties and taken steps to ensure that your Personal Information is adequately protected. The third parties may include domain registries, business partners, suppliers, sub-contractors, advertisers (we do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but will provide them with aggregate information to help us serve more relevant advertisements to an cohort of visitors and/or customers on various advertising platforms) analytics, search engine providers and evaluation companies. </p>
      <p>Where we employ third party companies or individuals to process Personal Information provided by us on our behalf for business functions, including (without limitation) IT support, hosting our data on cloud platforms, legal, accounting, audit, consulting and other professional service providers, and providers of other services related to our business. Portions of our services may be provided by organisations with which we have a contractual relationship, including subcontractors, and, accordingly, your Personal Information may be disclosed to them. We only provide these organisations with the information that they need to be able to perform their services. We will have in place an agreement with our service providers which will restrict how they are able to process your Personal Information.</p> 
      <p><strong>Sharing within LCN and to Service Providers</strong></p> 
      <p>The Personal Information you provide to us is collected by LCN. However where we are legally permitted to do so in accordance with this Privacy Policy, we may transfer your Personal Information between and to other functions or offices within the same corporate group as defined by section 1159 of the Companies Act for the purposes set out above.</p> 
      <p><strong>International Transfers of your Personal Information</strong></p> 
      <p>We may share or store your Personal Information with our third party service providers based outside the European Economic Area ("<strong>EEA</strong>") who we engage to help us, amongst other things, fulfil your order, process your payment details and the provision of support services. We only transfer your Personal Information outside of the EEA:</p>
      <ul> 
        <li>where the transfer is to a place that is regarded by the European Commission as providing adequate protection for your Personal Information; or</li> 
        <li>where we have put in place appropriate safeguards, for example by using a contract for the transfer which contains specific data protection provisions that have been adopted by the European Commission or a relevant data protection authority. You can request a copy of these contracts by contacting us at: <a href="mailto:dpo@lcn.com" class="underlined">DPO@lcn.com</a></li>
        <li>where you have consented to it, or there is another legal basis to allow us to make the transfer.</li> 
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Sharing with other third parties</strong></p> 
      <p>We may also provide your information to other third parties such as regulators and law enforcement agencies, where we are required by law to do so, where necessary for the purposes of preventing and detecting fraud, other criminal offences and/or to ensure network and information security.</p> 
      <h3>5. How long do we store Personal Information for?</h3>
      <p>It is our policy to retain your Personal Information for the length of time required for the specific purpose or purposes for which it was collected, which are set out in this Privacy Policy. However, on occasion we may be obliged to store some data for a longer time, for example, where a longer time period is required by applicable laws.
