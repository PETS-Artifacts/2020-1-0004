<h3>III.  Protection of personal data concerning children</h3>

<p>However, certain Netvibes products and services may be appropriate for use by children, and in that case children must seek consent from their parents prior to creating a Netvibes account. Teachers and school administrators may act in the place of parents and provide consent for the collection of Personal Data from children (schools should always ensure that they have received permission from parents to do so).</p>
<p>If parents become aware that their child has provided Netvibes with Personal Data without their consent or without a teacher’s or school administrator’s consent, they can ask Netvibes to remove such Personal Data and terminate the child’s account by sending a request at <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us">http://www.netvibes.com/en/contact-us</a>.</p>

<h3>IV. Methods and purposes of commection of personal data</h3>
<p>Note that You provide Your Personal Data on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p>Netvibes collects Personal Data online and offline (e.g., via a business card voluntarily given to a Netvibes employee) and this Privacy Policy is applicable regardless of the means of collection. </p>

<h3>V. Cookies</h3>
<p>Cookies are text files stored and used to record non-personal and personal information concerning Your browsing of the Site.</p>
<p>Netvibes may use cookies or other technologies which may collect or store Personal Data to improve services for You through, for example: </p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"> - enabling a service to recognize your device so You don't have to give the same information several times<br /><br />
			 - recognizing that You may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do so repeatedly<br /><br />
			 - measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast<br /><br />
			 - analyzing data to help Netvibes understand how people interact with the Site so Netvibes can improve the Site</p>
<p>Netvibes may also use third party vendors to measure and analyze the effectiveness of the Site. In such a case, web beacons and cookies provided by such third party vendors may be used and stored.</p>
<p>Netvibes may use two types of cookies: permanent cookies and temporary cookies. Temporary cookies disappear as soon as You log off from the Site. Permanent cookies remain after logging off from the Site in order to be used on subsequent visits to the Site.</p>

<h3>VI. Personal data processing and storage term</h3>
<p>Processing of Personal Data includes using, storing, recording, transferring, adapting, summarizing, amending, reporting, sharing and destroying Personal Data as necessary under the circumstances or as otherwise required by law.</p>

<h3>VII. Links to websites not controlled by Netvibes</h3>
<p>This Site might offer links to third party Websites which may be of interest to You.</p>
<p>Unless Netvibes receives Your express authorization, Netvibes does not share any Personal Data with these third parties. However, Netvibes may provide them with Non-Personal Data.</p>
<p>Netvibes does not exercise any control over the content of third party Websites or the practices of these third parties in connection with the protection of Personal Data that they might collect and are thus not under the control of Netvibes. Consequently, Netvibes declines all liability for the content of third party websites or the practices of these third parties concerning the protection of Personal Data.</p>
<p>It is therefore Your responsibility to inform yourself as to these third parties' privacy policies.</p>
<h3>VIII. Transfer of personal data</h3>
<p>If You are accessing the Site from a location outside of the European Union, please note that through Your continued use of the Site, which is governed by French law, the corresponding Terms of Services and this Privacy Policy, You are transferring Your Personal Data to the European Union and You consent to that transfer.</p>
<p>As a member of a global group, Netvibes is able to use available technology to efficiently manage Personal Data and obtain such Personal Data online or otherwise throughout its affiliates’ international operations.  Personal Data may be collected through the Site and subsequently disclosed to and used by an affiliate of Netvibes (along with Netvibes, “3DS Group Companies”) for the purposes stated in section 4 of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>Please note that Netvibes may transfer Your Personal Data outside of the European Union, as long as before transferring Your Personal Data, Netvibes has ascertained that non European Union entities, including Netvibes’ affiliates and subsidiaries, offer an adequate level of protection in accordance with European legislation.</p>
<p>Where Netvibes has knowledge that a third party to which Netvibes has provided Personal Data for the purposes listed in section 4 above, is using or disclosing Personal Data contrary to this Privacy Policy or to applicable laws, Netvibes will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop such use or disclosure.</p>
<p>You will have the opportunity to decide whether You authorize Netvibes to use Your Personal Data for a purpose differing from the purpose for which it was originally collected.<br /><br />
			Netvibes will also disclose Personal Data to third parties if Netvibes determines that such disclosure is necessary for technical reasons (such as hosting services by a third party) or to protect Netvibes’ legal interests (such as in the event of sale of assets to a third company, or change of control or total or partial liquidation of Netvibes). Additionally, Netvibes may share Your personal Data with the reseller assigned to You or in the territory where You are located. Netvibes may also share Your personal data with business partners when Netvibes and the business partner sponsor an event together or participate in a marketing promotion together and in which You engage.</p>
<p>Netvibes may also disclose Your Personal Data if required by law or if Netvibes believes in good faith that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (for example, a warrant, a subpoena, or other court order) or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Netvibes, our customers, or the public.</p>
<p>These transfers may be transmitted over the Internet, via mail, via facsimile, or by any other method that Netvibes determines is appropriate and in accordance with applicable law.</p>
<h3>IX. Right of access to and rectification of the data</h3>
<p>Netvibes will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data collected is used for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy and that such Personal Data is correct and up to date.</p>
<p>You have a right to access Your Personal Data. In addition, You have a right to request the rectification, completion, update and erasure of Your Personal Data. You also have a right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data stored by Netvibes.</p>
<p>If You have an account, You may be able to exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the Personal Data by logging on to Your account. Otherwise, You may exercise Your rights of access to and rectification of the data by writing at NETVIBES, Legal, 10 place de la Madeleine, 75008 Paris (France) or sending an email to the following address:  <a href="mailto:security@netvibes.com">security@netvibes.com</a>.</p>
<p>Depending on the scope of the request, Netvibes reserves the right to charge a reasonable fee to cover any out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such access, modification and deletion of Personal Data.  Netvibes may deny access to Personal Data in limited circumstances, defined by applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<h3>X. Data security and recipients</h3>

You are responsible for the confidentiality of Your password and information appearing on Your account. Consequently, You must ensure that You log out of Your session in the event of shared use of a computer.</p>
