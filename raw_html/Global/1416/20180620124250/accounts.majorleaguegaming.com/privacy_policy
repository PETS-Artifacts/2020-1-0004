Additionally, we collect and combine Information when you link a third party account (e.g., XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo, Steam, and Battle.net) to your MLG account, such as the username associated with you third party account, and the use of certain Properties may require you to link a third party account to your MLG account.&nbsp;</p>

You also have the option to customize your profile and publicly share certain Information, such as your name, age, date of birth, gender, online contact information, third party account information (e.g., social media account information) and information about what video games you play and what video game consoles you own. If you choose to link certain third party accounts to your MLG account, additional information may be required to be shown publicly (e.g., if you link your XBOX Live or PlayStation Network account, the username associated with that account will be shown on the public profile associated with your MLG account).</p>

<p><b>B. Use of Our Properties</b></p>

<p>When you visit or use our Properties we collect, process and/or combine Information about your use of those Properties, such as websites you visited before and after you used a Property, browser type and language, IP address, hardware and software information, third party account information (for example, Information associated with your XBOX Live, PlayStation Network, Nintendo, Steam, or Battle.net account), gameplay data, purchase histories, and Social Media data. We use Cookies and/or similar technologies (collectively referred to as &ldquo;<b>Cookies</b>&rdquo;) to do this.&nbsp; In addition, we or our partners also use Cookies to serve ads in our Properties.

However, you may be required to provide credit card and/or billing information to one of our third-party vendors in order to complete a purchase or receive a prize. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of our third-party vendors before providing them with your personal information, as their privacy practices may vary from ours.&nbsp; At the time of purchase, in specific cases, you also have the option to provide Information (such as your email address) to MLG for the purpose of sending you additional information or offers.</p>

<p><b>G. Chat rooms, Message Boards and Forums</b></p>

For more information about how your Social Media uses and protects your personal information, please refer to their privacy policies and terms of use.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><a id="holder_4" name="holder_4"></a>4. Children and Parents</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MLG does not knowingly collect or store any personal information from children under 13 in the US or under the relevant age threshold in other jurisdictions where the child is located. However, we may collect technical information required for delivering the service and for the support of our internal operations from all users of our Properties.

<p>We recognize a special need to protect the personal information of children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, phone numbers, or other personal information without parental permission, when online. MLG also recommends that parents familiarize themselves with parental controls available on consoles, mobile telephones, tablets and other devices they provide to their child and accompany their child if aged under 13 years of age when online. Parents should contact MLG immediately if they have any concerns. Please see the&nbsp;<a href="#holder_9"><b>Contacting Us</b></a>&nbsp;section below for further details.</p>

<p><b><a id="holder_5" name="holder_5"></a>5.&nbsp; Your Choices&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Your Choices About Information Provided by Third Parties</b></p>

</ul>

<p>Please note that any information, including personal information that you reveal in a bulletin board, message board, chat room or other public forum is publicly viewable.</p>

<p><b>Vendors</b></p>

<p>Vendors provide goods and services (for example, media partners, event ticket providers, merchandise vendors, survey providers, billing, consumer services support, consultancy, information technology hardware and software) to MLG in order to support, operate and develop the Properties and to deliver marketing communications on our behalf. Vendors use your Information to execute, deliver and/or from time to time improve the services they provide. We do not share Information with vendors to use for their own direct marketing purposes or any other purpose other than those set out in this section without your consent.</p>

<p><b>Third Parties</b></p>

<p>Other third parties may need your Information in order to provide goods and/or services you have requested, for example, to deliver MLG products that you have purchased. In addition, MLG may offer goods and/or services jointly with, on behalf of, a third party. These goods and/or services may be hosted on the Properties or on the third party&rsquo;s service. By virtue of these relationships, we may share the Information you submit in connection with these goods and/or services with the third party. MLG is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, which may use your Information for their own purposes. The third party&rsquo;s use of your Information will be governed by that third party&rsquo;s privacy policy. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.</p>

<p><b>Law</b></p>

<p>We will disclose your Information in the good faith belief that we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or us to legal liability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This may include responding to legal requests from jurisdictions outside of the United States where we have a good faith belief that the response is required by law in that jurisdiction, affects users in that jurisdiction, and is consistent with internationally recognized standards.</p>

<p><b>Legal Rights</b></p>

<p>We will disclose your Information where necessary for the purpose of exercising, establishing or defending our legal rights.&nbsp; For example, we will review your communications and other account information in order to investigate allegations of hacking or any other breach or alleged breach of any applicable Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy and disclose your personal information, including communications, to our legal advisors, consultants and law enforcement or other government officials.</p>

<p><b>Protecting Others</b></p>

<p>We disclose your Information with third parties where we believe this is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of any person. For example, we disclose Information relating to an online account if we in good faith believe the user of that account is using it in ways that are harmful to others (e.g. making inappropriate contact with minors).&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Sale of Our Business or Assets</b></p>

<p>Separately, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, MLG&#39;s customer information including Information and communications may be transferred to our successor or assign.</p>

<p><a href="#holder_14">Back to top</a></p>

<p><b><a id="holder_7" name="holder_7"></a>7.&nbsp; Security</b></p>

<p>MLG takes a range of security measures &ndash; as set out in detail below &ndash; designed to help protect your Information. However, complete online and offline security can never be guaranteed, so you should always take care when sharing your information online.</p>

<p>MLG takes a range of security measures designed to protect your personal information and keep it confidential (unless it is non-confidential by nature, for example, publicly-available information like user generated content, competition rankings and scores, etc.).&nbsp; We also take steps to ensure that the personal information collected is protected from misuse and alteration. In addition, we request vendors who process personal information on our behalf to themselves take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information. However, the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is constantly evolving, as are the technical and organizational industry standards relating to management of those risks. The complete security of any personal information collected, stored or used by us or our vendors cannot therefore be guaranteed.</p>

<p><a href="#holder_14">Back to top</a></p>

<p><b><a id="holder_8" name="holder_8"></a>8.&nbsp; Accessing Information and Retention Period</b></p>

<p>As set out in more detail below, you can view, correct update or request the deletion of your personal information in any of your MLG accounts at any time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If for any reason you wish to view, correct, or update personal information collected about you, or if you want to delete your MLG account, simply access your MLG account through&nbsp;<a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/">http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/</a> and edit/delete your personal information. You will need your password to access your personal account. You may also send us an email asking us to delete your account at <a href="mailto:privacy@majorleaguegaming.com">privacy@majorleaguegaming.com</a>. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Retention Period</b></p>

<p>We delete your personal information which we process for the performance of the contract or based on your consent in case you terminate your contract with us, delete your MLG account, withdraw your consent or where you request us to delete your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. As an exception, we will not delete your personal information where we still have a legitimate interest to use your personal information. For example, we may still retain your Information to resolve disputes, enforce our Terms of Service or other user agreements, or comply with legal requirements; in this case, your personal information will be blocked from use for any other purpose. In any case, we will not retain or use your personal information longer than necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. Due to technical reasons, residual copies of Information that has been removed from your account and/or the Properties may remain in our backup systems.&nbsp;</p>
