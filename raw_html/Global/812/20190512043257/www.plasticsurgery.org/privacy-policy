<p>In addition, the ASPS Parties may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide personally identifiable information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose such information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. The ASPS Parties reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Privacy rights under </span>the European<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> regulation</span>:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transparency and the right to information.</strong> We provide notice to our members, website users and other third parties who interact with us on how we use personal data in our day-to-day activities at the time of collecting personal data, or as soon thereafter as possible. We also publish this privacy notice for greater transparency.</p>
<p><strong>Right to access, rectification, restriction of processing, erasure and data portability.</strong> If you are based in the EEA or Switzerland, we provide you with access to your own personal data. In addition, we will rectify your personal data when it is incorrect or inaccurate, and we will ensure the right to erasure, portability and restriction of processing when these rights are not incompatible with other legal obligations.</p>
<p><strong>Right to object and withdraw consent at any time:</strong> For all marketing materials, you can opt-out any time, free of charge.

<h2><a name="6"></a>6. International Transfers of Personal Data</h2>
<p><strong>If you are located outside the United States and you interact with our website or provide us personal data, then your personal data may be transferred to the United States.</strong></p>
<p>We transfer your personal data to the United States whenever you interact with us. The U.S. has not sought, nor obtained adequacy status from the European Union. The level of protection of your personal data is not deemed equivalent to the one in the EEA, unless the receiving organization is self-certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield. The ASPS Parties have not sought self-certification under the EU-US Privacy Shield, and PSF, as an organization exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is not able to self-certify under the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles.</p>
<p>Article 49 of the GDPR permits the ASPS Parties to transfer your personal data on the basis of the following derogations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explicit consent</strong>, for newsletter subscribers and certain processing in relation to organizing events or facilitating access to information, such as storing photos;</li>
<li><strong>Necessity to enter and for the performance of a contract</strong> for registration information to participate in our events; for processing personal data of our members and third-party users to maintain their relationship with our organization, provide them services including when they log in to their member or online user accounts; and also for processing personal data for online and offline courses.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for safeguards to your personal data, we directly apply the GDPR provisions to your personal data. As a matter of principle, we do not engage in any onward transfers regarding your data, beyond the access that our processors have to your data, except for sharing among the ASPS Parties and our membership mailing list rental program. We carefully select our processors and we require that they provide equivalent safeguards.</p>
<h2><a name="7"></a>7. Data Security</h2>
<p><strong>The ASPS Parties are committed to the security, confidentiality and integrity principle. We take commercially reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use, and we periodically review our security measures.</strong></p>
<p>The ASPS Parties use PCI DSS and SSL certificates to provide secure, encrypted communication between our websites and any Internet browser. We use high-grade encryption and the secure https protocol to communicate with your browser software, which mitigates the risk of interception of the credit card information you give us. We also employ several different security techniques to protect your personally identifiable information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the organization. The Web servers for the ASPS Parties are located in a secure environment, and computer systems are maintained in accordance with industry standards of like organizations to secure information. You should be aware, however, that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.</p>
<p>This site contains links to other sites. While the ASPS Parties strive to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, the ASPS Parties not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites.</p>
<p>NONE OF THE ASPS PARTIES MAKES ANY CLAIMS, PROMISES OR GUARANTEES ABOUT THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR ADEQUACY OF THE CONTENTS OF ITS SITE, AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR ERRORS AND OMISSIONS IN THE CONTENTS OF THIS SITE. NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, IMPLIED, EXPRESSED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND FREEDOM FROM COMPUTER VIRUS, IS GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTENTS OF THEIR WEBSITE OR ITS HYPERLINKS TO OTHER INTERNET RESOURCES. REFERENCE IN THEIR WEBSITE TO ANY SPECIFIC COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS, PROCESSES OR SERVICES, OR THE USE OF ANY TRADE, FIRM OR CORPORATION NAME IS FOR THE INFORMATION AND CONVENIENCE OF THE PUBLIC AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ENDORSEMENT OR RECOMMENDATION BY THE ASPS PARTIES.</p>
<h2><a name="8"></a>8. Retention Periods</h2>
<p><strong>ASPS applies the storage limitation principle in order to retain personal data in our records only for the length of time required to fulfill the purpose for which the data was collected.</strong></p>
<p>According to our retention policy, we keep personal data in our records only as long as they are necessary for the purposes for which they have been processed. The retention period depends on the context in which we process data and on specific circumstances such as regulations requiring retaining information for a certain period of time. These circumstances may include local laws, the reasonably anticipated future business needs for the data, the benefit to the user to have the data available, legal requirements to hold the data, or similar circumstances. For example, application for membership, including letters of support, letters from ABPS, letters of concern, etc. are stored during the period of candidacy and active membership, plus one year thereafter. The same period applies to correspondence and the rest of the information is stored for a maximum period of three years, unless relating to active dispute, in which case until resolution. Only Ethics and Membership Committee Disciplinary Files are stored permanently for archiving purposes according to our internal regulations.</p>
<h2><a name="9"></a>9. Changes to this Policy</h2>
<p><strong>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. We will duly inform you of any changes.</strong></p>
<p>The ASPS Parties may occasionally update this privacy statement and other statements referenced by it as new services and programs are introduced. These changes will be notified to you via e-mail communication and/or by placing a prominent notice on the site. The time stamp you see on the policy will indicate the last date it was revised.</p>
