However, for up to 28 days you may still receive further mailings which were already in progress prior to you asking us to stop.</li><li>We may send marketing information by post or call you for marketing purposes, unless you have previously opted out or said that you don't want to be contacted. Prior to carrying out postal mailings we may check against the Mail Preference Service. We also use a data cleaning company based in the UK to ensure that our address records are accurate and up to date, and to stop mailings to people who have died.</li><li>We collect personal data e.g. your name, postal and email addresses, when you give them to us for various purposes, such as donating, seeking advice, signing up for an event, or applying for a job. We carry out data matching on people who support us through donating, fundraising, or campaigning. This means that we will combine information you have given us, such as your postcode, with information from other sources. For example, we use a tool called Mosaic, which is owned by Experian for data matching. <ul><li>We do data matching to: <ul><li>exclude people who we consider may be vulnerable (such as people living in care homes) from marketing communications</li><li>to build a better profile of our supporters so that we can more effectively target our communications</li><li>to tailor our communications to you and to predict the level at which you might be able to support us in future</li></ul></li><li>We will do data matching for these reasons unless you let us know that you don't want us to.

                        <p>Profiling is gathering information about an individual or a group of individuals and analysing their characteristics or behaviour patterns in order to place them in a certain category or group, and/ or to make predictions or assessments about their ability to perform a task, their interests or likely behaviour. We use several types of profiling and analysis, including: data matching, segmentation and major donor analysis. You can object to us profiling you by writing to our Data Protection Officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7UQ, or by email at <a href="mailto:infogov@macmillan.org.uk">infogov@macmillan.org.uk</a>.</p><p>We use profiling techniques to ensure communications are relevant and timely, and to provide an improved experience to our supporters. For example, we use profiling to send information about campaigns and services in your area, or to find potential new supporters and invite you to be involved in supporting our cause through tailored communications which may be of interest to you.</p><p>We do this because it allows us to understand the background of the people who support us and use our services and helps us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may be able and willing to give more than they already do or to tailor our services to better suit them. We also use profiling to exclude people who may be vulnerable from marketing, for example, people living in care homes.  Profiling enables us to provide you with a service that is more relevant for you, while raising more funds, sooner, and more cost-effectively, than we otherwise would. Profiling allows us to be more efficient with our resources, which donors consistently tell us is a priority for them.</p><p>In order to create a profile for you, we (or our trusted service providers) may use the information which you give us and which we collect from external resources, including information that is publicly available about you. This sort of profiling can include us using information such as your age, property prices and average earnings where you live, your job, directorships, your financial circumstances, networks, any previous donations you have made, your philanthropic interests (trusteeships and/ or support to other charities), and your estimated wealth, to assess how likely it is that you would be interested in donating to us and the level of donation that you may be able to give. We use this information in our analysis of major donors.</p><p><strong>Data matching</strong></p><p>We use Experian for data matching. If you support us, we will match your postcode to Experian’s tool MOSAIC to get information about you such as household income, household composition and other demographic information. We then add this information to our record of you to tailor our marketing and services communications to you and to help us raise more funds.</p><p><strong>Segmentation</strong></p><p>We use Experian for behavioural analysis on our supporters, to help us segment our supporter database and to enable us to profile other supporters, if we have a legitimate interest to do so.</p><p>We also use software tools owned by other companies to help us analyse who is most likely to donate to us. We do this by using information we hold, such as your name, age, gender, address, donation history, the events and products you have engaged with, your volunteering status and any previous segmentation, and combining it with external profiling tools, to more accurately target our engagement with you.</p><p>We use a tool called FastStats by QBase for this purpose. QBase is based in the UK. We also use a tool called Raisers' Edge for the same purpose. Raiser's Edge is owned by Blackbaud, Inc. They are a US based company and are certified under the US Privacy Shield.  These businesses may rely on others for further information, such as GI, YouGov or Experian.</p><p>We may also use this information to help us determine whether and in what ways you might be interested in getting involved in our other fundraising activities. You can let us know if you would prefer us not to profile you in the ways set out here by contacting our Data Protection Officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, 89 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7UQ, or by email at <a href="mailto:infogov@macmillan.org.uk">infogov@macmillan.org.uk</a></p><p></p>

This includes organisations who fundraise on our behalf.</p><p>As part of our commitment to maintaining accurate data, we use trusted third-party service providers, such as Read Group, to ensure that we keep our record of you up to date. For example, if we have an out of date address for you, or we are unaware of a bereavement, they will let us know and we can update our records accordingly. Read Group do this by comparing the information we send them with any data they can access, such as Postal Address Files (PAF), and automatically flagging any differences to us. Generally, we only share your data with them if we plan to contact you as part of a campaign. Read Group are based in the UK and will not keep your data after this type of processing.</p><p>If you participate in our lotteries or raffles, your information will also be processed by our trading companies who administer and run these on our behalf. In addition, from time to time we may exchange your personal information with other organisations for the purposes of fraud and credit risk reduction. We may also share information with our financial and legal advisers for the purposes of obtaining advice and protecting our legal rights. We may also share your information with the emergency services if we think there is a risk of serious harm or abuse to you or someone else.</p><p>When we collect your personal information we use strict procedures and security features to prevent unauthorised access. However, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. As a result, while we try to protect your personal information, Macmillan Cancer Support cannot guarantee the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.</p><p>Where we share your information with companies based outside the EEA we will put in place safeguards to protect your data. We contract with a number of software companies based in the US and in most cases we rely on Privacy Shield to protect your data. However, there are some occasions where we rely on EU Standard Model Clauses.</p><p>We also share some information with <a href="#35">Facebook</a> as described below.</p><p></p>

This is a key transparency requirement under the GDPR.</li><li><strong>Right of access</strong> - you have a right to ask us to confirm whether we are processing information about you, and to request access to this information. You can do this by writing to our Data Protection Officer by email at <a href="mailto:infogov@macmillan.org.uk">infogov@macmillan.org.uk</a></li><li><strong>Right to object</strong> - you have the right to object to processing based on legitimate interests or performance of a task in the public interest/ exercise of an official authority (including profiling); direct marketing (including profiling) and processing for the purposes of scientific, statistical or historical research. We must comply with any request to stop processing for the purposes of direct marketing.

This includes the right to require us to pass on information we obtained from you to another data controller. This right applies when we process your data with consent, pursuant to a contract and we are carrying out processing by automated means.</li><li><strong>Right to be forgotten</strong> - you have a right to seek the erasure of your data. You may wish to exercise this right for any reason, for example where it is no longer necessary for us to continue holding or processing your personal data you may withdraw your consent. This right is not absolute, as we may need to continue processing this information, for example, to comply with our legal obligations, or for reasons of public interest. We may also need to keep some information about you in order to, for example, comply with an instruction not to contact you again. We will respond to a right to be forgotten request within one month.</li><li><strong>Right to restriction</strong> - you have a right to ask us to restrict our processing of your information ('right to restriction') if:<ul><li>you contest its accuracy and we need to verify whether it is accurate</li><li>the processing is unlawful and you ask us to restrict use of it instead of erasing it</li><li>we no longer need the information for processing, but you need it to establish or defend legal claims</li><li>you have objected to processing of your information being necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or for the purposes of our legitimate interests. The restriction would apply while we carry out a balancing act between your rights and our legitimate interests. If you exercise your right to restrict processing, we would still need to process your information for exercising or defending legal claims, protecting the rights of another person or for public interest reasons.</li></ul>This is an alternative right to the right to be forgotten and it is not an absolute right.

However, we often rely on different legal bases for different aspects of processing. This means that we may not be able to act on your request if we have a compelling legal reason not to. For example, if we originally collected your data with your consent, but we later need to investigate a complaint, we may be able to rely on legitimate interests to continue processing your information.</p><p></p>
