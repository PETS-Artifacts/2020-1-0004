No interest will be charged on my subsidized loan(s) during my deferment. However, interest will be charged on my unsubsidized loan(s). For any unsubsidized loan(s), I will receive an interest statement, and I may pay the interest at any time. If I do not pay the interest that accrues on my unsubsidized loan(s), it will be capitalized at the end of my deferment period. (2) My deferment will begin on the date the condition that qualifies me for the deferment began, as certified by the supporting documents sent to my servicer. (3) My deferment will end on the earlier of (A) the date that I no longer meet the condition that qualifies me for the deferment, or (B) the ending date of that condition as certified by the authorized official who signs the supporting documents sent to my servicer. (4) If my deferment does not cover all of my past due payments, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that were due before the begin date of my deferment. If the period for which I am eligible for a deferment has ended, ED may grant me a forbearance for all payments that are due at the time my deferment request is processed. (5) ED may grant me a forbearance on my loans for up to 60 days, if necessary, for the collection and processing of documentation related to my deferment request. ED will not capitalize interest that accrues during this forbearance.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI certify that: (1) The information I have provided in this online request is true and correct. (2) I will provide additional documentation to my servicer, as required, to support my eligibility for this deferment. (3) I will notify my servicer immediately if I no longer meet the condition that qualifies me for this deferment. (4) I have read, understand, and meet the eligibility requirements of the deferment for which I have applied.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eI authorize my schools, ED, and their respective agents and contractors to contact me regarding my loan request or my loan, including repayment of my loan, at the current or any future number that I provide for my cellular telephone or other wireless device using automated dialing equipment or artificial or prerecorded voice or text messages.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAUTHORIZED OFFICIAL\u0027S CERTIFICATION\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eIn the supporting documents received by my servicer, the authorized official must certify, to the best of their knowledge and belief, that the borrower or student is/was engaged in a ful-time rehabilitation training program, and that the borrower/student and the program meet all of the eligibility requirements stated in the eligibility requirements section. The authorized official must provide the beginning and end date of the program that qualifies the borrower for the deferment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eINSTRUCTIONS FOR COMPLETING THE FORM\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eBecause you are completing the online version of this form, you will be required to submit supporting documents separately. Your deferment will not be processed until we receive all required information.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eDEFINITIONS\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eAn authorized official who may certify supporting documents required for the authorized official\u0026rsquo;s certification section is an authorized official of the Rehabilitation Training Program.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eCapitalization is the addition of unpaid interest to the principal balance of my FFEL or Direct Loan program loan. The principal balance of a loan increases when payments are postponed during deferment/forbearance and unpaid interest is capitalized. As a result, more interest may accrue over the life of the loan, the monthly payment amount may be higher, or more payments may be required. The chart provides estimates, for a $15,000 loan balance at a 9% interest rate, of the monthly payments due following a 12-month deferment/forbearance. It compares the effects of paying interest, capitalizing interest at the end of a deferment/forbearance, and capitalizing interest quarterly and at the end of a deferment/forbearance. Your actual loan interest cost will depend on your interest rate, length of any deferment/forbearance, frequency of capitalization, and whether interest is payable by the federal government.

We also use your SSN as an account identifier and to permit you to access your account information electronically. The information in your file may be disclosed, on a case-by-case basis or under a computer matching program, to third parties as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate systems of records notices. The routine uses of this information include, but are not limited to, its disclosure to federal, state, or local agencies, to private parties such as relatives, present and former employers, business and personal associates, to consumer reporting agencies, to financial and educational institutions, and to guaranty agencies in order to verify your identity, to determine your eligibility to receive a loan or a benefit on a loan, to permit the servicing or collection of your loan(s), to enforce the terms of the loan(s), to investigate possible fraud and to verify compliance with federal student financial aid program regulations, or to locate you if you become delinquent in your loan payments or if you default. To provide default rate calculations, disclosures may be made to guaranty agencies, to financial and educational institutions, or to state agencies. To provide financial aid history information, disclosures may be made to educational institutions.

Paying interest during the period of deferment lowers the monthly payment by about $18 a month or about $772 over the life of the loan, as depicted in the chart below.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003ctable cellpadding=\u00225\u0022 cellspacing=\u00220\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctbody\u003e\r\n\u003ctr align=\u0022center\u0022 class=\u0022odd\u0022 valign=\u0022top\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTreatment of Interest Accrued During Deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eLoan Amount\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eCapitalized Interest for 12 Months\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003ePrincipal to Be Repaid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eMonthly Payment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eNumber of Payments\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTotal Amount Repaid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTotal Interest Paid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr align=\u0022center\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd align=\u0022left\u0022 style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is paid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$0.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$190.01\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,151.64*\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,151.64\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr align=\u0022center\u0022 class=\u0022odd\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd align=\u0022left\u0022 style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is capitalized at the end of deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$1,350.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$16,350.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$207.11\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,853.79\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,853.79\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr align=\u0022center\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd align=\u0022left\u0022 style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is capitalized quarterly during deferment and at the end of deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$1,396.25\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$16,396.25\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$207.70\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,924.09\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,924.09\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\r\n\u003c/table\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e*Total amount repaid includes $1,350 of interest paid during the 12-month period of deferment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eA deferment is a period during which I am entitled to postpone repayment of the principal balance of my loan(s).

The principal balance of a loan increases when payments are postponed during deferment/forbearance and unpaid interest is capitalized. As a result, more interest may accrue over the life of the loan, the monthly payment amount may be higher, or more payments may be required. The chart provides estimates, for a $15,000 loan balance at a 9% interest rate, of the monthly payments due following a 12-month deferment/forbearance. It compares the effects of paying interest, capitalizing interest at the end of a deferment/forbearance, and capitalizing interest quarterly and at the end of a deferment/forbearance. Your actual loan interest cost will depend on your interest rate, length of any deferment/forbearance, frequency of capitalization, and whether interest is payable by the federal government. Paying interest during the period of deferment lowers the monthly payment by about $18 a month or about $772 over the life of the loan, as depicted in the chart below.\u003c/li\u003e\r\n\u003c/ul\u003e\r\n\u003ctable cellpadding=\u00225\u0022 cellspacing=\u00220\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctbody\u003e\r\n\u003ctr class=\u0022odd\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTreatment of Interest Accrued During Deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eLoan Amount\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eCapitalized Interest for 12 Months\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003ePrincipal to Be Repaid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eMonthly Payment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eNumber of Payments\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTotal Amount Repaid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eTotal Interest Paid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is paid\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$0.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$190.01\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,151.64*\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,151.64\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr class=\u0022odd\u0022\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is capitalized at the end of deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$1,350.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$16,350.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$207.11\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,853.79\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,853.79\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003ctr\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003eInterest is capitalized quarterly during deferment and at the end of deferment\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$15,000.00\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$1,396.25\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$16,396.25\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$207.70\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e120\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$24,924.09\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003ctd style=\u0022border-style: solid; border-width: 1px;\u0022\u003e$9,924.09\u003c/td\u003e\r\n\u003c/tr\u003e\r\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\r\n\u003c/table\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003e*Total amount repaid includes $1,350 of interest paid during the 12-month period of deferment.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003cul\u003e\r\n\u003cli\u003eA deferment allows you to temporarily postpone making payments on your loan(s).
