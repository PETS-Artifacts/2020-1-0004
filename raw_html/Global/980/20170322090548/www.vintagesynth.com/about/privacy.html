Explorer alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. However,
some activities will, by their very nature, result in your personal

some areas of the Synth Forums, but you will not be able to access areas
or use features that require you to submit personal information, such as
posting topics and ads. You also have choices with respect to cookies.

and we do not sell or rent personal information about any of our users,
regardless of age. In addition, the Vintage Synth Explorer will not send
any direct email offers to users who indicate they are under the age of
13.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal
information online - for example in ads that you post or through email -
that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you
post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you
may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.
Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of
your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and
responsible whenever you're online.

aggregated information with third parties.

indirectly secure please be aware that the Internet is not a fully
secure medium.

authorities.
