<p><b>Ad networks and exchanges operated by authorized third parties</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may use third parties, such as advertising networks or exchanges, to allow us to serve you advertisements. These third-party ad networks and exchange providers may use third-party cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies to collect information. They may also collect your device identifier, IP address, or identifier for advertising (IDFA). The information that these third parties collect may be used to assist us in providing you with more relevant advertising that we serve on our site. Third-party cookies are covered by the third parties’ privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of our advertisers or partners link from our site to areas on their own sites where they sell their own products and services.  If you follow links from our site to others, you should be aware that you are doing business with those other sites, which have their own privacy and data collection practices. BabyPips.com makes reasonable effort to make sure our advertising partners have legitimate business practices, but we will not be responsible or liable for these independent policies (and we may not even know what they are). For more information regarding a site and its privacy policies, please review that sites terms of service, privacy policy and/or cookie policy.</span></p>
<h3><b>Your Rights as a User.</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can request access, correction, updates or deletion of your personal information at any time.  Send your requests to an administrator at support@babypips.com.</span></p>
<p><b>Your Choices and our use of cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We offer certain site features, services, applications, and tools that are available only through the use of these technologies. You are always free to block, delete, or disable these technologies if your browser, installed application, or device so permits. However, if you decline cookies or other similar technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain site features, services, applications, or tools. You may also be required to re-enter your password more frequently during your browsing session. For more information on how you can block, delete, or disable these technologies, please review your browser or device settings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generally, these technologies allow our site, services, applications, and tools to store relevant information in your browser or device and later read that information in order to identify you to our servers or internal systems. Where applicable, we protect our cookies and other similar technologies to help ensure that only we and/or our authorized service providers can interpret them by assigning them a unique identifier that is designed for interpretation only by us. We do not store any of your personal information on any of our cookies or other similar technologies</span></p>
<p><b>Your Choices and Advertising on our Site</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect information about your activities on this and other sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking </span><a href="http://preferences.truste.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (or if located in the European Union, by clicking </span><a href="http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">US readers also interested in opting out of certain data collection processes should visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s </span><a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/?c=1#!/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Opt-Out Page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>To Unsubscribe From Our Communications</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may unsubscribe from our marketing communications by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link located on the bottom of our email newsletters, updating your communication preferences, or by sending us email us at support@babypips.com.</span></p>
<h3><b>Does BabyPips.com share your personal information?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BabyPips.com will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users, except as described in this Privacy Policy.   </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not give, rent, lend, or sell individual information to our advertisers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of BabyPips.com when we have your opt-in or other consent to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may share your information publicly and with our partners such as service providers, third-party content providers, advertisers or connected sites, but in a manner which does not reveal your personally-identifiable information and which is aggregated with other user information to show usage of BabyPips.com and third-party products and services offered on our site and trends based on such categories as age, gender, geographical origination and other demographic characteristics.  For example, we might tell an advertiser that there are 20,000 registered email subscribers in Gotham City, but we will not tell them that Batman is one of them, nor will we tell them that his email address is </span><a href="mailto:bruce@statelywaynemanor.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bruce@statelywaynemanor.com</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you post content to our site, in on our forums or through any commenting or messaging systems, other site users will be able to see your posted content and may communicate with you.  If you send communications through our site using our Forums Message feature, the recipients of your communications, and anyone they send your communication to, along with our site administrators, will be able to see your communications.  If you do not want others to see your posted information or correspondence, or communicate with you, please do not post anything to or through our site.</span></p>
<p><b>Business Sales or Bankruptcy</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business, we reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the site, to a third party. In the event BabyPips.com enters a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information may be among the assets transferred.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</span></p>
<p><b>As Required by Law</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating the law or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) BabyPips.com’s rights or property, other site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. BabyPips.com may disclose or access account information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain, service, and improve our services.  </span></p>
<h3><b>Do we respect children’s privacy?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our site is not directed at children under the age of 13. We operate our site in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13.  In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under age 13, please contact us at legal@babypips.com.</span></p>
<h3><b>Will you ever transfer my information?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our site is operated in the United States. If you are located in the European Union, EEA, or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to, and processed in, the United States. By using our site, participating in any of our services or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, third parties with whom we share, who process, or who store your data may also be located outside of the European Union, EEA or the country where you are connecting from.  We’ve made an effort to review and understand those third parties’ privacy policies and that they comply with existing privacy laws of the United States and GDPR. We cannot, however, guarantee that those third parties will continue to adhere to those laws and regulations at all times. </span></p>
<h3><b>How do we protect your information?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using magic, of course!  Just kidding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encrypt your information using SSL and require the use of VPNs and, in some instances, multi-factor authentication to gain access to company systems or service provider systems used to operate our site. We review our information collection, storage and processing practices, as well as restrict access to personal information to a limited set of company employees or service providers that are subject to the obligation of strict confidentiality as relates to that information, and who will be subject to discipline, including termination, if they violate that obligation.</span></p>
<h3><b>How will you know whether BabyPips.com’s Privacy Policy has changed?</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, but we will give notice of any material changes (or any notices that we are required to give you) on our website and/or in email messages.  When required by law, we will obtain your consent or reconsent of this Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can access, change or delete your personal information at any time by contacting our support team at support@babypips.com.</span></p>
