        Statement for BookLocker.com</font></b><br>
        <br>
        <font size="3">BookLocker.com has created this privacy statement in order 
        to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses 
        our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: 
        BookLocker.com.<br>
        <br>
        You may visit BookLocker.com without identifying yourself, but if you'd 
        like to make a purchase you will need to register. Any information you 
        provide during the registration process, and the purchases you make, are 
        considered part of your BookLocker.com account. We use this information 
        to fill your orders, provide customer service assistance, and improve 
      the content of our site so that we may better serve you.</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="3"><br>
        <br>
        BookLocker.com believes that your personal information - including your 
        purchases, email and residential addresses, and credit card information 
        - belongs to you. We collect this information when you provide it and 
        we use it to develop our own marketing programs, but we do not rent or 
      sell information concerning our customers to third parties. </font></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The only circumstance 
        where your information would be technically &quot;sold&quot; is if Booklocker.com 
        were bought by another entity. In that case, all the company's assets, 
        including its customer database, would belong to the other entity.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">An author selling a book on Booklocker.com only sees the date, order number and royalty percentage owed to them of purchases related to his/her book. If the buyer provides the author with their order number directly, the author can trace that order number to a specific transaction in their author account. EXCEPTION: Authors retain all copyrights to their works. If a customer violates the copyright terms of a book (is discovered publishing/distributing copies without permission), Booklocker will provide the customer's contact information to the author so they can directly request the infringing activity be stopped.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We take all reasonable 
        precautions possible against hacking of our web server and customer database. 
        We update our software regularly and we have a dedicated SSL server to 
        protect your credit card and personal information. SSL encrypts all ordering 
        information so that it cannot be read in transit.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Because of the security 
        risks, w</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">e do
