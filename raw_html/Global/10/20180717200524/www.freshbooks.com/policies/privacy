<p>Subscribers and Customers, Etc. In the normal operation of the Site Subscriber timesheets (including information entered by &ldquo;staff&rdquo; members) and invoices are disclosed to the applicable Customers, and Customer information is disclosed to the applicable Subscriber. In general, information you enter on the Site is available to the other persons – whether they are Customers, Subscribers, staff members or others – to whom you give access to your account or to whom you give access to the information through the normal operation of the Site.</p>

We use credit card and other personally identifiable information (such as PayPal email addresses) you submit to us on the Site, and other information that we collect, as required, to process payments you make through the Site through our payment processor intermediaries. We do not store credit card or other payment method information unless the Subscriber or their Customers choose to enter credit card information for use in the FreshBooks recurring profiles module; in all other cases our payment processors have the sole and complete responsibility for the storage of credit card and payment information. We may also share personally identifiable information with our payment processor intermediaries for risk management and fraud prevention.</p>
<p>Related third party products and services. From time to time, we may offer you opportunities to receive related products and services that integrate with, or complement, the services we offer via the Site. For example, you may have the opportunity to request financial products or services, including loans, from third parties. We will only share your information with such third parties if you choose to request their products or services (or to be assessed for eligibility to receive such products or services). If you do choose to request such products or services, we will provide your information to the relevant third party on your behalf, as required to provide the products or services you have requested. We do not control the use, storage, retention, processing, or disclosure of your information by such third parties, and this Privacy Policy will not apply to them.

To learn how the third party commenting application uses your information, please review their privacy policy.</p>
<p>Subsidiaries and Affiliates; Service Providers. We may from time to time use the services of affiliates, subsidiaries and unrelated service providers in the operation of the Site, and may disclose personal information to them in the course of our use of their services. For example, we may use the services of third-party hosting companies to host the operation of the Site. This may involve the hosting of data, including personal information, on servers operated by those hosting companies. We take care to use only service providers that we believe are reputable, have equivalent or better security safeguards in place than us, and able to live up to our and your expectations, including about the handling of confidential information. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.</p>

<h3>Your Use of Other Persons’ Information</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate the services provided by the Site, the Site allows you in certain circumstances to give other Users limited access to the personal information of other persons. For example, if you are a Subscriber, you may use the Site to give access to a staff member to the personal information of your Customers. By entering into our <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a>, you agree that, with respect to the personal information of other persons that you collect, use and disclose on the Site, you have all necessary consents and rights to collect, use and disclose that information as described in this Privacy Policy from time to time, and you agree that the indemnity you give to us in the <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a> applies to any non-compliance by you with the foregoing.</p>
<p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address.

FreshBooks stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, tracking the success of our referral program, and compliance with laws. Your friend may contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com">privacy@freshbooks.com</a> to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>FreshBooks strives to protect your personal information. For security of transactions, we use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol, which encrypts any information, such as credit card number and billing information, you send to us electronically. The encryption process protects your information, by scrambling it before it is sent to us from your computer. Once FreshBooks receives your transmission, we make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our system. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. More information about security is available on the Site and in our <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">Terms of Use</a>. If you have any questions about the security of your personal information, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@freshbooks.com">privacy@freshbooks.com</a>.</p>
<h3>Other Information Collectors</h3>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties through the Site, whether they are Subscribers or Customers or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use, collection and disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. Since we do not control the information use, collection or disclosure policies of third parties, you are subject to their privacy policies. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.</p>
<p>Your use of automated bank account feeds enabled by the Yodlee, Inc. (&ldquo;Yodlee&rdquo;) data gathering service (the &ldquo;Yodlee Service&rdquo;) from within FreshBooks is subject to the Yodlee terms, which are available <a href="/policies/yodlee-terms-of-service">here</a>, and by using the Yodlee Service from within FreshBooks you consent to our and Yodlee’s use, collection and disclosure of your information as described in those Yodlee terms.</p>

<h3><a name="AccountDeletion" id="AccountDeletion"></a>Account Deletion</h3>
<p>FreshBooks is a complex business network that connects millions of users. FreshBooks manages a business eco system that brings together contractors, companies and customers. This network relies on the exchange and sharing of information that is important to others in your network. Tracked hours, sent invoices, paid invoices, contractor invoices are all vital to other people that work with you. These are the official history of work done and moneys paid.
The complexity and connected nature of the system requires that this history exists in perpetuity to accommodate proper function and accounting for the other systems that you have connected to via contracting hours, invoices, estimates. FreshBooks cannot guarantee the deletion of all your information.</p>
<p>When a customer chooses to close an account we will remove your information from our marketing and billing systems. This will ensure that there are not further mailings or billings directed towards the canceled user.</p>
<p>As we continue to refine FreshBooks we will establish a method for the complete removal of all user information from the system without breaking accepted accounting principles for other connected FreshBooks accounts. This document will evolve as these new methods are defined and tested for permanent account deletion. Users wishing to be notified when this development is complete can indicate their wishes via <a href="mailto:help@freshbooks.com">help@freshbooks.com</a> or <a href="18663036061">1.866.303.6061</a>.</p>
<h3>Data Retention</h3>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements; this retention period may extend past the point at which you close your account.</p>
<h3>Additional Policy Information</h3>
<p>Invitations: You have the opportunity to invite others to work with you through your FreshBooks account.
