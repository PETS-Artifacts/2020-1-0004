	<p>With regard to the Principle of Accountability for Onward Transfer, we remain liable if our agent possesses such personal information in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

	<p><u>Opt-In to Certain Onward Transfers.</u> We will not transfer your personal information to a third party acting as a controller without first providing you with information regarding the identity of such controller or the nature of such controller’s business, and obtaining your opt-in consent. You may grant such consent by emailing us at <a target="_blank" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bececcd7c8dfddc7fed8d1d1da8b8c90ddd1d3"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="1363617a6572706a53757c7c7726213d707c7e">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.</p>

	<p>In each instance, please allow us a reasonable time to process your response.</p>

	<p><u>Business Transfers.</u> In the event of a merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar corporate event, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we expect that the information that we have collected, including personal information, would be transferred to the surviving entity in a merger or the acquiring entity. All such transfers shall be subject to our commitments with respect to the privacy and confidentiality of such personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>

	<p><u>Disclosure to Public Authorities.</u> We may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.</p>

	<p><u>Opt-Out for Direct Marketing; Email Management.</u> You may opt out at any time from the use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes by emailing us at <a target="_blank" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#aadad8c3dccbc9d3eaccc5c5ce9f9884c9c5c7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="84f4f6edf2e5e7fdc4e2ebebe0b1b6aae7ebe9">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>.

	<h3>Information Collected by or Through Third-Party Companies</h3>

	<p>We may share your usage information with third parties for ad distribution and ad optimization (defined as the tailoring, targeting (i.e., behavioral, contextual, and retargeting), analyzing, managing, reporting, and optimizing of ads). These third parties may use cookies, pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs), and/or other technologies to collect such usage information for such purposes. Pixel tags enable us, and these third-parties, to recognize a browser’s cookie when a browser visits the site on which the pixel tag is located in order to learn which advertisement brings a user to a given site. You may opt-out of the tailoring of advertising based on information we collect. To learn more about the use of this information, or to choose not to have this information used by our providers or third party advertising partners by opting out, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</p>

	<h4>INFORMATION THAT YOU SHARE THROUGH THE PLATFORM</h4>

	<p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personally identifiable or other information available to third parties (including other Registered Users) — for example, through your public profile, on message boards, through email or other direct messages, or in comment or chat areas — that information can be seen, collected, heard, and/or used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any third-party use of your information, and this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information that you share in any of the foregoing ways.</p>

	<h4>ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

	<p>Upon request by sending an email to <a target="_blank" href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#9aeae8f3ecfbf9e3dafcf5f5feafa8b4f9f5f7"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="aadad8c3dccbc9d3eaccc5c5ce9f9884c9c5c7">[email&#160;protected]</span></a>, we will provide you with confirmation as to whether we are processing your personal information, and have the data communicated to you within a reasonable time after your request. You have the right to correct, amend or delete your personal information where it is inaccurate or has been processed in violation of this Privacy Policy. We may require payment of a non-excessive fee to defray our expenses in this regard. Please allow us a reasonable time to respond to your inquiries and requests.</p> 

	<h4>RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>

	<p>We will retain your personal information in a form that identifies you only for as long as it serves the purpose(s) for which it was initially collected as stated in this Privacy Policy, or subsequently authorized. We may continue processing your personal information for longer periods, but only for the time and to the extent such processing reasonably serves the purposes of archiving in the public interest, journalism, literature and art, scientific or historical research and statistical analysis, and subject to the protection of this Privacy Policy. After such time periods have expired, we may either delete your personal information or retain it in a form such that it does not identify you personally.</p>

	<h4>HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>

	<p>We take very seriously the security and privacy of the personal information that we collect pursuant to this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, we will implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations.</p>

	<h4>CHILDREN</h4>

	<p>We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 through our Website, App or Platform.

We have further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints from EU and/or Swiss individuals under the Privacy Shield Principles to BBB EU PRIVACY SHIELD, a non-profit alternative dispute resolution provider located in the United States and operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by us, please visit www.bbb.org/EU-privacy-shield/for-eu-consumers/ for more information and to file a complaint.
