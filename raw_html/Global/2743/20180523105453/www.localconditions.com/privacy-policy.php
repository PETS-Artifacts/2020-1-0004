server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you

providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing

personalized functionality..

partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website

unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into LocalConditions.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically

accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If

you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable

some of the functionality on our Website.<br />
<br />
<b>c. Personal Information Users</b><br/>

Visitors to our website can leave reports for a weather and/or traffic market. When you do so, we will

request some personal information such as name and email and other relevant information. You may also be asked to disclose

personal information to us so that we can provide assistance and information to you. For

example, such data may be warranted in order to provide online technical support and

troubleshooting.

We will not disclose personally identifiable information we collect from you to third

parties without your permission except to the extent necessary including:

<ul>

<li>To fulfill your service requests for use of the website.</li>

<li>To protect ourselves from liability</li>

<li>To respond to legal process or comply with law, or</li>

<li>In connection with a merger, acquisition, or liquidation of the company.</li>

Usage Data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of our Service, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.<br/><br/>

<b>6. USE OF "WEB BEACONS" OR "GIF FILES"</b><br />
LocalConditions.com Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes also called single-pixel gifs - that allow LocalConditions.com to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver cobranded services.

<br/><br/>
