server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you

time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a site, a cookie

helps the site to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. Hence, this

simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases site navigation by

providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing

personalized functionality..

partner companies, but does not allow other companies to place cookies on our website

unless there is a temporary, overriding customer value (such as merging into LocalConditions.com a site that relies on third-party cookies).

accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If

you reject cookies by changing your browser settings then be aware that this may disable

some of the functionality on our Website.<br /><br />

Generally, those tracking cookies are to offer Ads that are specific to a visitor's web surfing and purchasing trends.<br/><br/>
These methods may be used by these service providers to place a persistent cookie on your computer. This allows the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or emails and compile anonymous information in relation to those page views, which in turn enables us and our service providers to learn which advertisements bring you to our website and/or how you leave the site. <br/><br/>
We are however, as part of our terms of use, not to be held responsible for any possible failures of third-party advertisers to practice proper and safe uses of tracking cookies and the information they collect. <br/><br/>

Google uses cookies (AKA, the DoubleClick cookie) to help serve the ads it displays on the websites of its partners, such as websites displaying Google ads or participating in Google certified ad networks. When users visit a Google partner's website, a cookie may be dropped on that end user's browser. Users may opt out of personalized advertising by visiting <a href="https://www.google.com/settings/ads" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a> or visit <a href="https://www.aboutads.info" target="_blank">www.aboutads.info</a> for more information.
