 <p>We may collect such personal information as your name, postal address, telephone number, fax number, e-mail address, contact and billing information, transaction history (including order, lead, demo and service/repair history) and credit card or other financial information (which shall be encrypted).</p>
 <p>Through your in-person communications and/or online interactions with Agilent, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences.

 <p>Agilent’s global organizational structure requires the global transfer of personal data within the Agilent group of companies. As a consequence and as permitted by applicable law, the personal information that you provide to us may be transferred across state or country borders, including to countries outside the country in which you reside (including to countries outside of the European Economic Area ("EEA")), to consolidate data storage, simplify information management or synchronize customer relationship activities globally. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the country in which you reside (including countries outside of the EEA) who work for us or one of our resellers, distributors, service providers or suppliers. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfillment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services.

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
