<p>The personal information that we collect from you in relation to the selling of our products and services will be subject to the terms of the local Agilent subsidiary you contract with. Where the GDPR applies, such personal information will be transferred to, and processed in the USA by Agilent Technologies, Inc. under the European Commission&rsquo;s model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries (i.e., the standard contractual clauses) (the &ldquo;<strong>Model Clauses</strong>&rdquo;), pursuant to Decision 2004/915/EC and 2010/87/EU. Please contact privacy_advocate@agilent.com, if you would like to see a copy of the Model Clauses.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Agilent&rsquo;s global organizational structure also requires the global transfer of personal information within the Agilent group of companies. As a consequence, as it is in our legitimate interests for the efficient operation of a global company, and as permitted by applicable law, the personal information that you provide to us will be transferred across state or country borders, including to countries outside the country in which you reside (including to countries outside the EEA), to consolidate data storage, simplify information management or synchronize customer relationship activities globally. It will also be processed by staff operating outside the country in which you reside (including countries outside of the EEA) who work for us or one of our resellers, distributors, service providers or suppliers as noted below.</p>
<p>We share your information with selected recipients. These categories of recipients include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cloud storage providers to store the personal information you provide and for disaster recovery services;</li>
<li>Service providers that provide us with customer relationship management services;</li>
<li>Services providers that provide us with survey services;</li>
<li>Service providers that provide us with market research services;</li>
<li>Agents and suppliers that provide us with technology services;</li>
<li>Authorized service providers for field service engineering;</li>
<li>Distributors of our products and services;</li>
<li>Sales management services providers that provide us with SaaS services;</li>
<li>Services providers including that provide us with invoicing services; and</li>
<li>Our professional advisors, auditors and business partners;</li>
<li>Support providers to provide customer support services.</li>
</ul>

<p>Where the GDPR applies and the recipient of your personal information is located outside the European Economic Area (&ldquo;<strong>EEA</strong>&rdquo;), such transfer will either be: (i) to a recipient certified to the US Department of Commerce's EU-US Privacy Shield; or (ii) subject to the Model Clauses. For more information about the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework, visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/page/eu-us-privacy-shield">website</a>. If you would like to see a copy of the Model Clauses, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy_advocate@agilent.com">privacy_advocate@agilent.com</a>.</p>
