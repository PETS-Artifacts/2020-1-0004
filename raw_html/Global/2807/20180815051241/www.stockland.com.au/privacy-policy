<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">Where we have disclosed personal information to a third party acting on our behalf, we request that those third parties do not use the personal information for their own purposes and that they comply with this privacy policy.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>Do we disclose personal information outside Australia?</strong></p>

<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">A cookie is a small text file that a website may write to your hard drive when you visit the website. A cookie file can contain information, such as a userID, that the website uses to track the pages you have visited. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you personally supply. A cookie cannot read data on your hard disk or read cookie files created by other websites.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">Stockland's websites use cookies to track user traffic patterns and to better serve you when you revisit the website. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, providing you with the opportunity to either accept or reject it. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. We handle personal information collected by cookies in the same way that we handle all other personal information as described in this privacy policy.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>Security of Information</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">Stockland may hold your personal information in either electronic or hard copy form. We take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse, interference and loss, as well as unauthorised access, modification or disclosure and we use a number of physical, administrative, personnel and technical measures to protect your personal information. For example, no employee should be able to access information that they do not require for their duties. There are passwords and security access IDs in place to restrict access to confidential and personal information to those who need it to perform their duties.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>Third party links</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">Our websites and mobile applications may contain links to websites operated by third parties.&nbsp; Those links are provided for your convenience and may not remain current or be maintained. Unless expressly stated otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of, or any content on, those linked websites, and have no control over or rights in those linked websites.&nbsp; We note that the privacy policies that apply to those websites may differ from this privacy policy.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>Access and correction of personal information</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">If you wish to seek access to the personal information we may hold about you, please contact our Privacy Officer using the contact details set out below. Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with a suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you).</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold. For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others or it would result in a breach of confidentiality. If that happens we will give you written reasons for the refusal.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. If you wish to update the personal information that Stockland may hold, please complete the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.stockland.com.au/change-details.htm"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Change Details Request Form</span></a>. In some unusual cases we may not agree that there are grounds for amending your personal information. If that happens, we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">We will not charge you for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. Depending on the nature of the request, we may ask you to provide us further information in order to verify your identity, put your request in writing and to complete an enquiry form, which will be sent to you.</p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;"><strong>What is the process for complaining about a breach of privacy?</strong></p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">If you think we have breached the Privacy Act, or you wish to make a complaint about the way we have handled your personal information, please contact our Privacy Officer. Please provide your name, email address and/or contact number and details of your complaint. Our Privacy Officer deals with privacy complaints and any complaints should be directed to the Privacy Officer using the contact details set out below. We will attempt to confirm as appropriate and necessary with you your understanding of the conduct relevant to the complaint and what you expect as an outcome. </p>
<p style="margin: 6pt 0in;">After Stockland has completed its investigation, we will contact you, usually in writing, to advise the outcome and invite a response to our conclusions about your complaint. If we receive a response from you, we will assess it and advise if Stockland has changed its view. If you are unsatisfied with the outcome, we will provide you with information about the further steps you can take.</p>
