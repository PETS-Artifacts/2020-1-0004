                                    <p>The Internet Solutions Abuse Department is responsible for the administration of abuse queries and complaints and ensures that clients are made aware of abuse complaints that have been lodged against them. <br /> <br /> The IS Abuse Department defines ‘abuse’ as any behaviour by a user connected to the IS network that is considered unacceptable as per the IS AUP (Acceptable Use Policy). <br /> <br /> Abuse complaints may include, but are not limited to, spam, copyright infringements, virus/worm attacks, security related issues (phishing, hack attempts, DOS attacks) and general abuse (harassment and vulgarities). IS Abuse concerns itself solely with abuse queries originating from the IS network.</p>
<h3>What do we do</h3>

                                    <p>The purpose of this document is to provide an understanding of Internet Solutions’ Acceptable Use Policy. This policy serves to define the accepted behaviour of users on Internet Solutions’ (IS) network. This allows IS to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the integrity and quality of their services</li>
<li>Protect their customers and infrastructure from abuse</li>
<li>Adhere to the current laws and regulations governing organisations and service providers in the countries that they operate in</li>
<li>Co-exist within the global internet community as a responsible service provider.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Network</h3>
<ol>
<li>The user acknowledges that IS is unable to exercise control over the data passing over the infrastructure and the Internet, including but not limited to any websites, electronic mail transmissions, news groups or other material created or accessible over its infrastructure. Therefore, IS is not responsible for data transmitted over its infrastructure.</li>
<li>IS' infrastructure may be used to link into other networks worldwide and the user agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these networks.</li>
<li>Users of the IS network include not only the IS customers, but in the case of resellers of the IS’ services, the customers of the resellers too.  Resellers of IS’ services are responsible for the activities of their customers.</li>
<li>The user may obtain and download any materials marked as available for download off the Internet, but is not permitted to use their Internet access to distribute any copyrighted materials unless permission for such distribution is granted to the user by the owner of the materials.</li>
<li>The user is prohibited from obtaining, disseminating or facilitating over IS’ network any unlawful materials, including but not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Copying or dealing in intellectual property without authorisation</li>
<li>Child pornography, and/or</li>
<li>Any unlawful hate-speech materials </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To help ensure that all customers have fair and equal use of the service and to protect the integrity of the network, Internet Solutions reserves the right, and will take necessary steps, to prevent improper or excessive usage thereof.</li>
<li>The action that Internet Solutions may take includes, but is not limited to:
<ul>
<li>Limiting throughput</li>
<li>Preventing or limiting service through specific ports or communication protocols; and/or</li>
<li>Complete termination of service to customers who grossly abuse the network through improper or excessive usage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This policy applies to and will be enforced for intended and unintended (e.g., viruses, worms, malicious code, or otherwise unknown causes) prohibited usage.</li>
<li>Online activity will be subject to the available bandwidth, data storage and other limitations of the service provided, which Internet Solutions may, from time to time, revise at its own discretion and without prior notice to the customer</li>
</ol>
<h3>System and Network security</h3>
<ol>
<li>All references to systems and networks under this section includes the Internet (and all those systems and/or networks to which user is granted access through IS) and includes but is not limited to the infrastructure of IS itself</li>
<li>The user may not circumvent user authentication or security of any host, device, network, or account (referred to as "cracking" or "hacking"), nor interfere with service to any user, host, device, or network (referred to as "denial of service attacks"). The host, device, network or account shall also not be used for any illegal purpose, including phishing</li>
<li>Violations of system or network security by the user are prohibited, and may result in civil or criminal liability. IS will investigate incidents involving such violations and will involve and co-operate with law enforcement officials if a criminal violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation, the following:
<ul>
<li>Unauthorised access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of any system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without the express authorisation of IS</li>
<li>Unauthorised monitoring of data or traffic on the network or systems without express authorisation of IS</li>
<li>Interference with service to any user, device, host or network including, without limitation, mail bombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks</li>
<li>Forging of any TCP-IP packet header (spoofing) or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>e-Mail Use</h3>
<ol>
<li>It is explicitly prohibited to send unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam") of any kind (commercial advertising, political tracts, announcements, etc). This is strongly objected to by most Internet users and the repercussions against the offending party and IS can often result in disruption of service to other users connected to IS. In addition, spam is unlawful in terms of the Electronic Communications and Transaction Act 2002, and IS is entitled to take appropriate steps against the User in contravention of these provisions of the Act</li>
<li>Maintaining of mailing lists by users of IS is accepted only with the permission and approval of the list members, and at the members' sole discretion. Should mailing lists contain invalid or undeliverable addresses or addresses of unwilling recipients those addresses must be promptly removed</li>
<li>Users may not forward or propagate chain letters nor malicious e-mail</li>
<li>Public relay occurs when a mail server is accessed by a third party and utilised to deliver mails, without the authority or consent of the owner of the mail-server. Users' mail servers must be secure against public relay as a protection to both themselves and the Internet at large. Mail servers that are unsecured against public relay often become abused by unscrupulous operators for spam delivery and upon detection such delivery must be disallowed</li>
<li>IS reserves the right to examine users' mail servers to confirm that their server is not a public relay and the results of such checks can be made available to the user. IS also reserves the right to examine the mail servers of any users using IS mail servers for "smarthosting", content filtering or similar services at any time to ensure that the servers are properly secured against public relay. All relay checks will be done in strict accordance with IS' policy of preserving customer privacy</li>
</ol>
<h3>Usenet News</h3>
<ol>
<li>Users should, before using the service, familiarise themselves with the contents of the following newsgroups: news.newusers.questions, news.announce.newusers, news.answers.</li>
<li>Excessive cross-posting (ie, posting the same article to a large numbers of newsgroups) is forbidden.</li>
<li>Posting of irrelevant (off-topic) material to newsgroups (also known as USENET spam) is forbidden.</li>
<li>Posting binaries to a non-binary newsgroup is forbidden.</li>
<li>IS reserves the right to delete and/or cancel posts which violate the above conditions.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Interception</h3>
<p>The User acknowledges that IS is lawfully required to intercept communications in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation of Interception and Provision of Communication-related Information Act 70 of 2003 (“the Act”). Any interception of communications shall be strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Act, as and when required under the Act.</p>
<h3>Managing Abuse</h3>
<ol>
<li>Upon receipt of a complaint, or having become aware of an incident, IS reserves the right to:
<ul>
<li>Inform the user's network administrator of the incident and require the network administrator or network owner to deal with the incident according to this AUP</li>
<li>In the case of individual users suspend the user's account and withdraw the user's network access privileges completely</li>
<li>Charge the offending parties for administrative costs as well as for machine and human time lost due to the incident</li>
<li>In severe cases suspend access of the user's entire network until abuse can be prevented by appropriate means</li>
<li>Take such action as may be necessary to protect the integrity of the system, including, but not being limited to, system monitoring, as well as protocol management and shutting down of ports affected by viruses, worms or other malicious code</li>
<li>Implement appropriate technical mechanisms in order to prevent usage patterns that violate this AUP</li>
<li>Share information concerning the incident with other Internet access providers, or publish the information, and/or make available the users' details to law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any one or more of the steps listed above, insofar as they are deemed necessary by IS in its absolute and sole discretion, may be taken by IS against the offending party</li>
</ol>
<h3>Laws and Legislation</h3>
<ol>
<li>IS' infrastructure may be used only for lawful purposes. Users may not violate any applicable laws or regulations of South Africa within the territory of South Africa. Should the user reside outside of South Africa, the laws of the country in which the user resides shall apply</li>
<li>Transmission, distribution or storage of any material on or through the infrastructure in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorisation, and material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws</li>
<li>The User undertakes to use IS’ services in accordance with any restrictions imposed under the following legislation:
<ul>
<li>Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002</li>
<li>Electronic Communications Act 36 of 2005</li>
<li>Films and Publications Act 65 of 1996 (as amended)</li>
<li>Regulation of Interception and Provision of Communication-related Information Act 70 of 2003</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Legal Rights</h3>
<ol>
<li>Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to limit Internet Solution’s rights or remedies in any way with respect to any of the aforementioned activities, and Internet Solutions reserves the right to take any action that it may deem appropriate with respect to such activities, including without limitation:
<ul>
<li>Investigating suspected violations of this AUP</li>
<li>Taking action to recover costs and expenses incurred in identifying and resolving abuse</li>
<li>Terminating users' access to and use of the Internet Solutions service</li>
<li>Levying cancellation charges to cover Internet Solutions’ costs in the event of termination of the Internet Solutions service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, Internet Solutions reserves all available rights and remedies with respect to such activities at law or in equity.</li>
<li>This AUP may be clarified or modified periodically and Internet Solutions reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, any such changes coming into effect as soon as they are published on the Internet Solutions website (www.is.co.za).</li>
<li>This policy forms part of Internet Solutions’ standard terms and conditions of service.</li>

                                <li data-is="tag-accordion-option" acctitle="Peering Policy" data-url="peering-policy">
                                    <p class="lead">This policy describes the expected requirements for settlement-free peering between the applicant and Internet Solutions (IS). Any type of settlement-based peering doesn’t fall within the scope of this policy.</p>
<h3>General Peering Policy statement</h3>
<ul class="mb-0">
<li>IS will peer directly or through any public Internet Exchange (preferable a community driven Internet Exchange) with any Internet Protocol (IP) based service provider.</li>
<li>IS prefers that all of the criteria defined below are met and agree that the conditions of the peering agreement will be determined by current and periodic reviews of this peering policy.</li>
<li>Peering will be done on a negotiated basis, with location and cost as agreed to by both parties.</li>
<li>IS prefers that no written peering agreement be entered into but may consider it upon request by the applicant.</li>
<li>The contractual relationship between IS and its peering partner, including all the respective parties’ rights and obligations, will be constituted solely by this peering agreement.  No rights or obligations are intended to arise out of or be conferred through the Peering Policy.</li>
<li>Both parties do agree that peering is fully based on a best effort basis without any guarantees whatsoever.</li>
<li>In addition to the mentioned criteria, IS’ willingness to enter into peering arrangements will be subject to generally accepted commercial and technical considerations, including but not limited to the availability of peering ports and IS’ backbone capacity in particular locations.</li>
<li>It should be noted that the Peering Policy contains the general guidelines which will determine IS’ peering relationships. In all circumstances, irrespective of compliance with the Peering Policy, the decision on whether or not to peer with any particular party will be in IS’ sole and unfettered discretion.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amendments to Internet Solutions' Peering Policy</h3>
<ul class="mb-0">
<li>IS conducts periodic internal reviews of the Peering Policy to ensure it is staying relevant to changing business requirements.</li>
<li>IS reserves the right to modify the Peering Policy at any time in its sole and unfettered discretion.</li>
<li>Based on such modifications, existing peering partners may be asked at times to re-qualify for continued peering.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Peering criteria</h3>
<p><span>Section one contains the interconnection requirements which the network of a peering applicant must have in order for the applicant to be eligible for peering with IS. Section two contains the technical and operational requirements which the network of the peering applicant must comply with in order to peer with IS. Section three outlines any other general notices.</span></p>
<h4 style="margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: -20px;">Section one: Interconnection requirement</h4>
<p>In order to determine whether bilateral peering is mutually beneficial in a particular case, the extent of the geographic distribution of the Peering Applicant’s network will be the key indicator.</p>
<p><strong>Geographic Scope</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IS prefers that the Peering Applicant should be able to accommodate peering links in at least two geographically dispersed locations such as Cape Town and Johannesburg.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Backbone Capacity</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>IS prefers that the Peering Applicant must have a fully redundant backbone network with sufficient bandwidth to carry its own national traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ISPA Membership</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Peering applications from Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA) members will be preferred, however non-members may also be considered suitable for peering on a case by case basis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Customer Relationship</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>No peering applicant who is an IS transit client and maintains transit connections with IS at one or more locations shall be entitled to enter into a peering relationship.</li>
<li>IS prefers not peer with customers of any of its current peering partners.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top: -10px; margin-bottom: -20px;">Section two: Technical and operational requirements</h4>
<p><strong>Routing requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Both parties should attempt to endorse the principles described in Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS).</li>
<li>For onward advertisements, each Party must set the next hop to be itself. Hence, each Party will be seen as the next hop for its respective transit clients.</li>
<li>Each Party will implement “shortest exit routing” and advertise routes consistent with that policy, unless both Parties mutually agree otherwise based on special circumstances.</li>
<li>Each Party will restrict its advertisements to non-transit routes originating within the geographic region in which peering has been established and will not announce the received route outside of the region.</li>
<li>IS requires consistent route advertisements at all peering locations.</li>
<li>Under normal operating conditions, all traffic exchanged between IS and the Peering Applicant will occur over the peering connection.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>General requirements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>IS can unfortunately only peer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using eBGP</li>
<li>If the same ASN (Autonomous system number) is used by both parties for all peering sessions</li>
<li>If the said ASN is public ASN (as defined by the IETF)</li>
<li>Using public IP (IPv4 and/or IPv6) address space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each Party must maintain a fully functional 24x7 Network Operations Centre (NOC).</li>
<li>Both Parties are to take all reasonable steps necessary to limit or stop Denial of Service attacks identified from their respective networks to any customer or other peering partner where this Denial of Service traffic passes through or touches the interconnect point(s) between IS and its peering partner.</li>
<li>Both parties must implement reasonable filtering methods to prohibit routing instabilities from leaking out of their respective network.</li>
<li>Each Party must be responsive to unsolicited email and network abuse complaints, as well as routing and security issues, and should provide responses from a knowledgeable operations engineer within two hours.</li>
</ul>
<h4 style="margin-top: -20px; margin-bottom: -20px;">Section three: General policy notices</h4>
<ul>
<li>The requirements in section one must be met before peering can be established.</li>
<li>The requirements contained herein must continue to be met to continue a settlement-free interconnection relationship. The peering partner’s status under this Peering Policy will be evaluated periodically. In the case of a change in ownership or control of aPeering Partner, status of the peering relationship in terms of the Peering Policy will be evaluated within 30 days of such change.</li>
<li>IS reserves the right to terminate any peering relationship, for violations of the Peering Policy, or as a result of breach of the Peering Agreement. The Peering Agreement will provide that IS may terminate peering with a Peering Partner with immediate effect for non-compliance with the Peering Policy.</li>
<li>Peering with IS will be subject to IS' Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”). IS reserves the right to terminate any peering relationship, for violations of its AUP by a Peering Partner or any of its customers.</li>
<li>IS reserve the right to set, and/or convert any, and all route filters, and filter types at its sole discretion, to preserve network stability and route sanity. Reasonable effect will be made to notify the peer of the change.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="margin-left: 10px; line-height: 1;">Customer’s Obligations</h4>
<ol>
<li>IS is obliged to protect its technical infrastructure against security threats and to protect the interests of its customers by ensuring that the conduct of no one customer prejudices the user experience of the other customers. Accordingly, IS imposes certain reasonable rules relating to the Customer’s conduct while using the Services which are contained in IS’ Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) (available at www.is.co.za/Legal by clicking on the “legal” link). Because security threats can be fluid and acceptable usage can change, IS may from time to time amend this AUP by publication on its website. These amendments will not materially affect the Agreement, but will merely update the limits of the Customer’s existing duty to use the Services in a safe and responsible manner.</li>
<li>Customer shall not commit nor attempt to commit any act or omission which directly or indirectly
<ol>
<li>Damages in any way IS’ technical infrastructure or any part thereof</li>
<li>Impedes, impairs or precludes IS from being able to provide the Service/s in a reasonable and business-like manner</li>
<li>Constitutes an abuse or malicious misuse of the Service/s; or is calculated to have any of the abovementioned effects. In such an event, should IS incur expenses to remedy the situation, IS reserves the right to charge the Customer the amount necessary to cover IS’ additional expenditure. Notwithstanding the above, IS reserves the right to take any other appropriate action it may deem necessary to remedy the situation.</li>
</ol>

<li>Customer shall at all times adhere to and ensure compliance with the Schedule/s, if applicable</li>
<li>Under no circumstances may Customer resile from this Agreement or withhold or defer payment or be entitled to a reduction in any charge or have any other right or remedy against IS, its servants, its agents or any other persons for whom it may be liable in law if IS interrupts the Service to Customer as it would be entitled to do if Customer is in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement to IS.</li>

<li>If Customer elects to enforce the provisions of clause 7.1 and, within 3 (three) months of any repair undertaken by IS, the failure, defect or unsafe feature has not been remedied, or a further failure, defect or unsafe feature is discovered by Customer, IS shall, in its sole and absolute discretion:

</ol>
</li>
<li>IS shall not be responsible for any loss (including but not limited to loss of data, profits and goodwill), liability, damages (whether direct, indirect or consequential) or expense of whatsoever nature and howsoever arising if such loss is caused by any defect or failure in the Equipment due to:

<li>
<h4 style="margin-left: 10px; line-height: 1;">Application of the Consumer Protection Act</h4>
<ol>
<li>A transaction (as defined in the CPA) between the Customer and IS may or may not fall under the provisions of the CPA depending upon whether certain values set out in clause 22.2 in respect of the Customer (“Threshold Values”) are below a certain value at the time the transaction is entered into.</li>
<li>The Threshold Values are the Customer's asset value or annual turnover, and the value against which they are measured is as determined by the Minister of Trade and Industry by publication in the Government Gazette from time to time</li>
<li>IS' duties towards the Customer may vary depending upon whether the transaction in question is subject to the CPA, and IS will act upon the information given to it by the Customer in this regard. Consequently:
<ol>
<li>The Customer warrants that any statement made to IS in respect of its Threshold Values is accurate.</li>
<li>If the Customer claims that all the Threshold Values are below the relevant value, or otherwise that the CPA applies to the transaction in question, IS may at its instance require the Customer to provide it with financial statements as proof thereof.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If the Customer misstates the Threshold Values in such a way that IS considers for a period that the transaction is subject to the CPA when it is not, all provisions of this Agreement that do not apply to transactions subject to the CPA shall retroactively apply to the transaction in question, and the Customer shall be liable for any damage sustained by IS resulting from such misstatement.</p>
                                </li>
