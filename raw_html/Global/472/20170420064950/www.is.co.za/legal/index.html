<li>Customer’s Obligations
<ol>
<li>IS is obliged to protect its technical infrastructure against security threats and to protect the interests of its customers by ensuring that the conduct of no one customer prejudices the user experience of the other customers. Accordingly, IS imposes certain reasonable rules relating to the Customer’s conduct while using the Services which are contained in IS’ Acceptable Use Policy (“AUP”) (available at www.is.co.za/Legal by clicking on the “legal” link). Because security threats can be fluid and acceptable usage can change, IS may from time to time amend this AUP by publication on its website. These amendments will not materially affect the Agreement, but will merely update the limits of the Customer’s existing duty to use the Services in a safe and responsible manner.</li>
<li>Customer shall not commit nor attempt to commit any act or omission which directly or indirectly
<ol>
<li>damages in any way IS’ technical infrastructure or any part thereof;</li>
<li>impedes, impairs or precludes IS from being able to provide the Service/s in a reasonable and businesslike manner;</li>

<li>Under no circumstances may Customer resile from this Agreement or withhold or defer payment or be entitled to a reduction in any charge or have any other right or remedy against IS, its servants, its agents or any other persons for whom it may be liable in law if IS interrupts the Service to Customer as it would be entitled to do if Customer is in default of any of its obligations under this Agreement to IS.</li>

</li>
<li>General
<ol>
<li>No variation, amendment or consensual cancellation of this Agreement or any provision or term thereof or of any agreement, bill of exchange or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement shall be binding unless recorded in a written document signed by a duly authorized representative from both IS and Customer. With respect to new  pricing and/or service specifications in respect of existing Service/s, an IS MAC Form signed by a duly authorised representative of IS and a duly authorised representative of Customer will constitute a written variation of the Agreement in accordance with this clause 21.1.</li>
<li>The parties acknowledge having read and understood this Agreement and are not entering into this Agreement on the basis of any representations not expressly set forth in it.</li>
<li>Neither Party shall be bound by any express or implied term, representation, warranty, promise or the like not recorded herein, whether it induced the Agreement between Customer and IS or not.</li>
<li>No extension of time or waiver or relaxation of any of the provisions or terms of this Agreement, bill of exchange or other document issued or executed pursuant to or in terms of this Agreement, shall operate as an estoppel against either Party hereto in respect of its right under this Agreement, nor shall it operate so as to preclude either of the parties thereafter from exercising its rights strictly in accordance with this Agreement.</li>
<li>In the event that any provision of this Agreement conflicts with any statute, ruling or order of any governmental or regulatory body from time to time, then such provision of this Agreement shall be controlled by the statute, ruling or order.</li>
<li>Nothing in the Agreement shall constitute a partnership, joint venture, agency or employment between the Parties hereto, and neither Party shall have the authority or power to bind, or contract in the name of, or to create a liability against the other in any way for any purpose.</li>
<li>Should any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement be held to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable, such terms and conditions will be severable from the remaining terms and conditions which will continue to be valid and enforceable.</li>
<li>In the event of any expiration, termination or cancellation of this Agreement, provisions hereof which are intended to continue and survive shall so continue and survive. In particular, termination or cancellation of this Agreement shall not affect any rights or duties arising under it with respect to Proprietary Information as set out in clause 14 above.</li>
<li>The terms and conditions appearing in the Schedule(s) hereto are hereby incorporated into the Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the Standard Terms and Conditions of this Agreement and those appearing in any Schedule/s hereto, these Standard Terms and Conditions shall prevail. In respect of any conflict in respect of pricing in the Agreement or the Schedules hereto, the costs set out in the Cost Schedule shall prevail.</li>
<li>These terms and conditions, together with the Schedule(s), Annexures and attachments hereto, constitute the whole of the agreement between IS and Customer relating to the subject matter hereof, notwithstanding anything in Customer’s inquiry, specification, acceptance, order or other documentation or discussion to the contrary.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Application of the Consumer Protection Act
<ol>
<li>A transaction (as defined in the CPA) between the Customer and IS may or may not fall under the provisions of the CPA depending upon whether certain values set out in clause 22.2 in respect of the Customer (“Threshold Values”) are below a certain value at the time the transaction is entered into.</li>
<li>The Threshold Values are the Customer's asset value or annual turnover, and the value against which they are measured is as determined by the Minister of Trade and Industry by publication in the Government Gazette from time to time</li>
<li>IS' duties towards the Customer may vary depending upon whether the transaction in question is subject to the CPA, and IS will act upon the information given to it by the Customer in this regard. Consequently:
<ol>
<li>The Customer warrants that any statement made to IS in respect of its Threshold Values is accurate.</li>
<li>If the Customer claims that all the Threshold Values are below the relevant value, or otherwise that the CPA applies to the transaction in question, IS may at its instance require the Customer to provide it with financial statements as proof thereof.</li>
<li>If the Customer misstates the Threshold Values in such a way that IS considers for a period that the transaction is subject to the CPA when it is not, all provisions of this Agreement that do not apply to transactions subject to the CPA shall retroactively apply to the transaction in question, and the Customer shall be liable for any damage sustained by IS resulting from such misstatement.</li>

                                    <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>The purpose of this document is to provide an understanding of Internet Solutions’ Acceptable Use Policy.  This policy serves to define the accepted behaviour of users on Internet Solutions’ (IS) network.  This allows IS to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Maintain the integrity and quality of their services</li>
<li>Protect their  customers and infrastructure from abuse</li>
<li>Adhere to the current laws and regulations governing organisations and service providers in the countries that they operate in</li>
<li>Co-exist within the global internet community as a responsible service provider.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Network</strong><br /><br /></p>
<p>1. The user acknowledges that IS is unable to exercise control over the data passing over the infrastructure and the Internet, including but not limited to any websites, electronic mail transmissions, news groups or other material created or accessible over its infrastructure. Therefore, IS is not responsible for data transmitted over its infrastructure.</p>
<p>2. IS' infrastructure may be used to link into other networks worldwide and the user agrees to conform to the acceptable use policies of these networks.</p>
<p>3.  Users of the IS network include not only the IS customers, but in the case of resellers of the IS’ services, the customers of the resellers too.  Resellers of IS’ services are responsible for the activities of their customers.</p>
<p>4. The user may obtain and download any materials marked as available for download off the Internet, but is not permitted to use their  Internet access to distribute any copyrighted materials unless permission for such distribution is granted to the user by the owner of the materials.</p>
<p>5. The user is prohibited from obtaining, disseminating or facilitating over IS’ network any unlawful materials, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copying or dealing in intellectual property without authorisation</li>
<li>Child pornography, and/or</li>
<li>Any unlawful hate-speech materials </li>
</ul>
<p>6. To help ensure that all customers have fair and equal use of the service and to protect the integrity of the network, Internet Solutions reserves the right, and will take necessary steps, to prevent improper or excessive usage thereof.</p>
<p>7. The action that Internet Solutions may take includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Limiting throughput</li>
<li>Preventing or limiting service through specific ports or communication protocols; and/or</li>
<li>Complete termination of service to customers who grossly abuse the network through improper or excessive usage.</li>
</ul>
<p>8. This policy applies to and will be enforced for intended and unintended (e.g., viruses, worms, malicious code, or otherwise unknown causes) prohibited usage.</p>
<p>9. Online activity will be subject to the available bandwidth, data storage and other limitations of the service provided, which Internet Solutions may, from time to time, revise at its own discretion and without prior notice to the customer.</p>
<p><strong>System and Network security</strong></p>
<p>1. All references to systems and networks under this section includes the Internet (and all those systems and/or networks to which user is granted access through IS) and includes but is not limited to the infrastructure of IS itself.</p>
<p>2. The user may not circumvent user authentication or security of any host, device, network, or account (referred to as "cracking" or "hacking"), nor interfere with service to any user, host, device, or network (referred to as "denial of service attacks"). The host, device, network or account shall also not be used for any illegal purpose, including phishing.</p>
<p>3. Violations of system or network security by the user are prohibited, and may result in civil or criminal liability. IS will investigate incidents involving such violations and will involve and co-operate with law enforcement officials if a criminal violation is suspected. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unauthorised access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of any system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without the express authorisation of IS</li>
<li>Unauthorised monitoring of data or traffic on the network or systems without express authorisation of IS</li>
<li>Interference with service to any user, device, host or network including, without limitation, mail bombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks</li>
<li>Forging of any TCP-IP packet header (spoofing) or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>e-Mail Use</strong></p>
<p>1. It is explicitly prohibited to send unsolicited bulk mail messages ("junk mail" or "spam") of any kind (commercial advertising, political tracts, announcements, etc). This is strongly objected to by most Internet users and the repercussions against the offending party and IS can often result in disruption of service to other users connected to IS. In addition, spam is unlawful in terms of the Electronic Communications and Transaction Act 2002, and IS is entitled to take appropriate steps against the User in contravention of these provisions of the Act.</p>
<p>2. Maintaining of mailing lists by users of IS is accepted only with the permission and approval of the list members, and at the members' sole discretion. Should mailing lists contain invalid or undeliverable addresses or addresses of unwilling recipients those addresses must be promptly removed.</p>
<p>3. Users may not forward or propagate chain letters nor malicious e-mail.</p>
<p>4. Public relay occurs when a mail server is accessed by a third party and utilised to deliver mails, without the authority or consent of the owner of the mail-server. Users' mail servers must be secure against public relay as a protection to both themselves and the Internet at large. Mail servers that are unsecured against public relay often become abused by unscrupulous operators for spam delivery and upon detection such delivery must be disallowed.</p>
<p>5. IS reserves the right to examine users' mail servers to confirm that their server is not a public relay and the results of such checks can be made available to the user. IS also reserves the right to examine the mail servers of any users using IS mail servers for "smarthosting", content filtering or similar services at any time to ensure that the servers are properly secured against public relay. All relay checks will be done in strict accordance with IS' policy of preserving customer privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Usenet News</strong></p>
<p>1. Users should, before using the service, familiarise themselves with the contents of the following newsgroups: news.newusers.questions, news.announce.newusers, news.answers.</p>
<p>2. Excessive cross-posting (ie, posting the same article to a large numbers of newsgroups) is forbidden.</p>
<p>3. Posting of irrelevant (off-topic) material to newsgroups (also known as USENET spam) is forbidden.</p>
<p>4. Posting binaries to a non-binary newsgroup is forbidden.</p>
<p>5. IS reserves the right to delete and/or cancel posts which violate the above conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Interception</strong></p>
<p>1. The User acknowledges that IS is lawfully required to intercept communications in accordance with the provisions of the Regulation of Interception and Provision of Communication-related Information Act 70 of 2003 (“the Act”). Any interception of communications shall be strictly in accordance with the requirements of the Act, as and when required under the Act.</p>
<p><strong>Managing Abuse</strong></p>
<p>1. Upon receipt of a complaint, or having become aware of an incident, IS reserves the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inform the user's network administrator of the incident and require the network administrator or network owner to deal with the incident according to this AUP</li>
<li>In the case of individual users suspend the user's account and withdraw the user's network access privileges completely</li>
<li>Charge the offending parties for administrative costs as well as for machine and human time lost due to the incident</li>
<li>In severe cases suspend access of the user's entire network until abuse can be prevented by appropriate means</li>
<li>Take such action as may be necessary to protect the integrity of the system, including, but not being limited to, system monitoring, as well as protocol management and shutting down of ports affected by viruses, worms or other malicious code</li>
<li>Implement appropriate technical mechanisms in order to prevent usage patterns that violate this AUP</li>
<li>Share information concerning the incident with other Internet access providers, or publish the information, and/or make available the users' details to law enforcement agencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Any one or more of the steps listed above, insofar as they are deemed necessary by IS in its absolute and sole discretion, may be taken by IS against the offending party.</p>
<p><strong>Laws and Legislation</strong></p>
<p>1. IS' infrastructure may be used only for lawful purposes. Users may not violate any applicable laws or regulations of South Africa within the territory of South Africa. Should the user reside outside of South Africa, the laws of the country in which the user resides shall apply.</p>
<p>2. Transmission, distribution or storage of any material on or through the infrastructure in violation of any applicable law or regulation is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, material protected by copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property right used without proper authorisation, and material that is obscene, defamatory, constitutes an illegal threat, or violates export control laws.</p>
<p>3. The User undertakes to use IS’ services in accordance with any restrictions imposed under the following legislation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electronic Communications and Transactions Act 25 of 2002</li>
<li>Electronic Communications Act 36 of 2005</li>
<li>Films and Publications Act 65 of 1996 (as amended)</li>
<li>Regulation of Interception and Provision of Communication-related Information Act 70 of 2003</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Legal Rights</strong></p>
<p>1. Nothing contained in this policy shall be construed to limit Internet Solution’s rights or remedies in any way with respect to any of the aforementioned activities, and Internet Solutions reserves the right to take any action that it may deem appropriate with respect to such activities, including without limitation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigating suspected violations of this AUP</li>
<li>Taking action to recover costs and expenses incurred in identifying and resolving abuse</li>
<li>Terminating users' access to and use of the Internet Solutions service</li>
<li>Levying cancellation charges to cover Internet Solutions’ costs in the event of termination of the Internet Solutions service.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. In addition, Internet Solutions reserves all available rights and remedies with respect to such activities at law or in equity.</p>
<p>3. This AUP may be clarified or modified periodically and Internet Solutions reserves the right to modify this policy at any time, any such changes coming into effect as soon as they are published on the Internet Solutions website (www.is.co.za).</p>
<p>4. This policy forms part of Internet Solutions’ standard terms and conditions of service.</p>
<p>All cases of violation of the above Acceptable Use Policy should be reported to <a href="mailto:%20abuse@is.co.za">abuse@is.co.za</a>.</p>

We are of the assumption that if we do not receive feedback, no action has been taken to resolve the abuse. </p>
<p><span class="text-primary">What are the consequences if I ignore the complaint? </span>You are in breach of Internet Solution’s AUP and therefore run the risk of having your services suspended.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">What steps do you take to inform me about the complaint? </span>IS Abuse will email the Abuse/Technical contact listed on our system for your company.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I have received a complaint but I am not the correct company contact to resolve the issue. What should I do? </span>Please contact your IS Account Manager with the updated information.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I have acknowledged the complaint, how do I go about resolving it? </span>IS Abuse only notifies you of the issue at hand unfortunately we do not offer technical assistance.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I’ve reported a complaint to abuse and requested feedback, how long will it take to be actioned? </span>IS Abuse will action within 2 working days. If no feedback has been received after this period please phone IS Abuse.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I want to escalate my complaint, how do I go about doing this? </span>This can be done through the Global Service Centre on (011) 575 0055</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I want all the complaints against me merged into one. Can this be done? </span>No, each and every abuse complaint that is logged with the IS Abuse Department receives a unique ticket number.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">Can I be held responsible for a virus outbreak on my computer/network? </span>Yes, ensuring the security of one’s network (wireless, anti-virus, security patches etc) is the responsibility of the IS customer.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I do not agree with the wording that I “have” done something illegal. Why not change it to “I am suspected of”? </span>The complaint has been forwarded in its original wording.  IS does not tamper with content.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">I have received an AOL or YAHOO complaint for spam however the email complained of is a legitimate email. How do I resolve this? </span>Should the email be legitimate correspondence you may liaise with the recipient of the email to resolve the matter. The abuse reporting is not done by AOL or Yahoo. AOL and Yahoo are third parties providing the means to the end user. </p>

<p><span class="text-primary">High-level Security risk: </span>These are risks which compromise the integrity of the IS network and should be dealt with immediately. Phishing sites, compromised hosts, etc. are some examples of High-level security risks.</p>
<p><span class="text-primary">Section 205 Subpoena: </span>The steps to follow to obtain client information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The client will need to report the incident of abuse to his/her local police station to obtain a case number</li>
<li>Once a case number has been issued, a warrant for information or Section 205 Subpoena can be requested from a court of law by a member of the SAPS</li>
<li>The Section 205 Subpoena or warrant will then be served onto the IS Legal Department by the SAPS</li>
<li>For further information the IS Legal Department can be contacted on 011 575 1000, alternatively an email can be sent to legal@is.co.za? </li>
