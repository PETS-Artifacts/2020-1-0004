However, use of your personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the unlikely event of a liquidation, bankruptcy, or administration. Our customer database could be sold separately from the rest of the business, in whole or in a number of parts.  It could be that the purchaser's business is different from ours, too.<br /><br /><strong>Newsletters</strong><br /><br />If you sign up as a member on the Site, you will receive our Innkeeper newsletter, which is an integral part of the services we provide.

We may use this information to provide you with location-based services, such as advertising, search results, and other personalized content. Most mobile devices allow you to turn off location services. If you have questions about how to disable your device's location services, we recommend you contact your mobile service carrier or your device manufacturer.</span></p><p style="line-height: normal;"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Telephone Calls</span></strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><br /><br />As well as collecting data online and from correspondence we may also speak with you face to face (for example at an Innkeeper’s meeting) or by telephone.  We frequently record telephone conversations.  Those recordings are also governed by this Privacy Policy and we keep this data in the same way that we keep other data.  Recordings of calls may also be transferred to locations or processed worldwide.<br /><br /><strong>Inquiries and other Electronic Communications</strong><br /><br />Travelers may send inquiries to members via clickable links on the listings on a Site. Further, travelers and members may communicate with each other via tools on a Site. If you choose to send an inquiry through these links, your personal information, including your email address and any other information you supply (unless the Site specifies otherwise),will be visible to the member in question so that they might reply directly to you. Your details may also be sent to us and we have access to those communications even if you contact the member directly. If members and travelers further engage in communications through a Site, we also have access to those communications, which we monitor for trust and security purposes. Additionally those inquiries and messages may be hosted on, be processed by or transmit through our servers. If you engage in such communications and call the other party, you may be asked to leave a return telephone number. Do not share information in the e-mail or phone call that you are not prepared to allow such person and HomeAway group to have, including, but not limited to, credit card and bank account information. In addition inquiries and messages can be sent to the individual member you selected and to our system. Our customer service team may share such communications with members. We may also from time to time, use third party e-mail servers to send and track receipt of such communications, and analyze the pattern of such communications for trust and security purposes as well as to gather data, such as inquiry and booking data (on an anonymous basis), to assist us in better understanding our business.<br /><br /><strong>How Do We Protect Your Personal Information Once We Have It?</strong><br /><br />We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to guard against unauthorized or unlawful processing of your personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, your personal data. While no system is completely secure, we believe the measures implemented by the Site reduce our vulnerability to security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. We have security measures in place to protect our user database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains your responsibility:<br />•    To protect against unauthorized access to your use of the Site;<br /><br />•    To ensure no-one else uses the Site while your machine is logged on to the Site (including by logging on to your machine through a mobile, Wi-Fi or shared access connection you are using);<br /><br />•    To log off or exit from the Site when not using it;<br /><br />•    Where relevant, to keep your password or other access information secret.  Your password and log in details are personal to you and should not be given to anyone else or used to provide shared access for example over a network; and<br /><br />•    To maintain good internet security.  For example if your email account or Facebook account is compromised this could allow access to your account with us if you have given us those details and/or permitted access through those accounts. If your email account is compromised it could be used to ask us to reset a password and gain access to your account with us. You should keep all of your account details secure.  If you think that any of your accounts has been compromised you should change your account credentials with us, and in particular make sure any compromised account does not allow access to your account with us.  You should also tell us as soon as you can, so that we can try to help you keep your account secure and if necessary warn anyone else who could be affected.<br />If you have asked us to share data with third party sites, however (such as Facebook) their servers may not be secure. Credit card information is generally stored by our credit card processing partners and we ask them to keep that data secure.  We also use third parties to help us optimize our website flow, content and advertising (see below). <br /><br />Note that, despite the measures taken by us and the third parties we engage, the internet is not secure.  As a result others may nevertheless unlawfully intercept or access private transmissions or data.<br /><br /><strong>What are Cookies, Web Beacons and Clear GIFs and Why Do We Use Them?</strong><br /><br />A "cookie" is a small file placed on your hard drive by some of our web pages.   We, or third parties we do business with, may use cookies to help us analyze our web page flow, customize our services, content and advertising, measure promotional effectiveness and promote trust and safety. Cookies are commonly used at most major transactional websites in much the same way we use them here at our Site.<br /><br />You may delete and block all cookies from this site, but parts of the site will not work. We want to be open about our cookie use.<br />Even if you are only browsing the Site certain information (including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, and the time of accessing the Site) is automatically collected about you. This information will be collected every time you access the Site and it will be used for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.<br /><br />You can reduce the information cookies collect from your device.  An easy way of doing this is often to change the settings in your browser. If you do that you should know that (a) your use of the Site may be adversely affected (and possibly entirely prevented), (b) your experience of this and other sites that use cookies to enhance or personalize your experience may be adversely affected, and (c) you may not be presented with advertising that reflects the way that you use our and other, sites. You find out how to make these changes to your browser at this site: www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/.  Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will send cookies as soon as you visit our site.  By using the site you consent to this, unless you change your browser settings.  <br /><br />We gather and share information concerning the use of the Site by members and travelers with one or more third-party tracking companies for the purpose of reporting statistics.

Where possible, if we're told about the inaccuracy of any personal information, we will make appropriate corrections. You can ask to see, update or amend any information we hold on you by contacting us.<br /><br /><strong>How do I opt-out of receiving marketing communications from you?</strong><br /><br />We will contact you from time to time for marketing purposes.
