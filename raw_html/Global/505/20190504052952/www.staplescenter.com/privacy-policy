<h1><strong>Personalization, Marketing and Advertising</strong></h1>
<p>Entertainment is personal, and we are always working to help you find the best concerts, festivals, sports, and other events for you to enjoy. In order to understand our customers&rsquo; preferences, and better recommend products and services that are personalized to our prior customers, we may link together personal data processed for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>when you make a purchase or other transaction through our Service;</u></li>
<li><u>when you attend our Events and Venues;</u></li>
<li><u>when you access and use our online Services; and</u></li>
<li><u>when you enter a contest or other promotion.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>We use this information for our legitimate interests in:</p>
<ul>
<li><u>market research and statistical analysis in connection with the improvement of our Services</u>;</li>
<li><u>personalizing</u> the Services and future offers you see;</li>
<li>creating <u>aggregate data</u>; and</li>
<li><u>marketing communications.</u></li>
</ul>
<p>We may also process this personal data for <u>targeted advertising</u>. However, where consent to processing is required by law, we will link and process this information for targeted advertising only with appropriate consent.</p>
<p><em><u>Aggregated data</u></em></p>
<p>We will collect and aggregate on an anonymous basis information about you, your spending and use of our Services with information about other users of the Services in order to identify trends (&ldquo;<strong>Aggregated Data</strong>&rdquo;). We may pass Aggregated Data to the third parties referred to in the section below to give them a better understanding of our business and to bring you a better service. Aggregated Data will not contain information from which you may be personally identified.</p>
<p><em><u>Marketing communications</u></em></p>
<p>Consistent with our legitimate business interests, we (or if appropriate, our <u>third party</u> partners) may send you marketing and promotional communications if you sign up for such communications or purchase products or services from us. Where allowed, we may also send you these communications if you register for our Services or for a promotion, or in connection with your communications with, or submission of User Content to, us. These communications may be <u>personalized</u> or customized based on your user profile. Similarly, we may also collect device data and contact data so that we can determine whether you have opened an email or otherwise interacted with our communications, and we may generate preferences data based on these interactions.</p>
<p><em><u>Personalization and profiling</u></em></p>
<p>We or other companies in Our Group will combine any personal data about you that we receive from you, from other companies in Our Group, and from third-parties in order to create marketing profiles.</p>
<p>Marketing profiles include personal data such as information about Services you have used or purchased previously, information about when you have visited our Events and Venues in the past and which parts of the building you visited or events you attended, demographic data and data from your social media profiles.</p>
<p>For example, we may analyze the personal data of people who have purchased tickets for a particular future event that we promote, operate, provide services for, or that is hosted at one of our Events and Venues, and then compare them with other people in our database. If we identify people in our database who have similar personal data to the original purchasers, we may then target marketing about that event to the new people we have identified in our database, for example by sending direct marketing emails. We may conduct the profiling and send the direct marketing emails automatically.</p>
<p><em><u>Targeted Advertising</u></em></p>
<p>Our Group, and certain third parties operating on or through our Services, may engage in targeted advertising. This form of advertising includes various parties and services providers, including third party data controllers, engaged in the processing of personal data in connection with advertising. These parties may be able to identify you across sites, devices, and over time.</p>
<p>The parties that control the processing of personal data for behavioral advertising purposes may create or leverage information derived from <u>personalization and profiling</u>. In some cases, these parties may also develop and assess aspects of a profile about you to determine whether you are a type of person a company wants to advertise to, and determine whether and how ads you see are effective. These third parties may augment your profile with demographic and other preferences data derived from these observations, and may also track whether you view, interact with, or how often you have seen an ad, or whether you complete a purchase for a good or services you were shown in an advertisement.</p>
<p>We generally use targeted advertising for the purpose of marketing our Services and third party goods and services, to send marketing communications, including by creating custom marketing audiences on third-party websites (such as Facebook).</p>
