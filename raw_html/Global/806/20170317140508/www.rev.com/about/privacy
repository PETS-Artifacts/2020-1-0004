<h2>Our Policy:</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the web sites (collectively, the <strong>&quot;Site&quot;</strong>) of
    Rev.com, Inc. (
    <strong>&quot;Rev&quot;</strong>, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; and/or &quot;our&quot;).
    This Site is
    operated by Rev and has been created to provide information about our company and
    transcription, video caption, translation and
    document related services (the &quot;Services&quot;) to our users (&quot;you&quot;,
    &quot;your&quot;). This
    Privacy Policy sets forth Rev's policy with respect to information, including personally
    identifiable
    data (<strong>&quot;Personal Data&quot;</strong>), and other information that is collected
    from Site visitors
    and users of the Services.
</p>

<h2>Information we collect:</h2>
<p>
    When you interact with us through the Site or the Services, we may collect Personal
    Data and other information
    from you, as further described below:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:</strong> We collect Personal
    Data from you when you
    voluntarily provide such information such as when you register for access to the Services
    (for example, your
    name and mailing address), use certain Services, contact us with inquiries or respond
    to one of our surveys.
    Wherever Rev collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy
    Policy.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our
        use of it in accordance with
        this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge and agree that such
        Personal Data may be
        transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Rev and the authorized
        third
        parties referred to herein located in the United States.
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Non-Identifiable Aggregated Data:</strong> When you interact with Rev through
    the Site or
    Services, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such
    information, which is
    collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically
    identify you.
    Rev may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases
    owned and
    maintained by Rev affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information
    and pool
    it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our
    Site, the number of
    visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors' Internet service
    providers, and how our
    users use and interact with the Services. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand
    and serve the users of
    the Services, Rev often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and
    behavior based on
    the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled
    and analyzed on an
    aggregate basis. Rev may share this non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates,
    agents and
    business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate information does
    not identify you personally.
    Rev may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Services to
    current and
    prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.
</p>
<p>
    In operating this Site, we may also use a technology called &quot;cookies.&quot;
    A cookie is a piece of
    information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access
    the Site. Our cookies
    help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more
    accurately. For instance,
    our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without
    needing to remember and
    then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which
    we use cookies, we will
    not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will
    find a &quot;help&quot;
    section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
    notification when you
    are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave
    cookies turned on because
    they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features.
</p>

<h2>Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
<p>
    Rev uses the Personal Data you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy
    Policy. If you
    provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection
    with the reason for which
    it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal
    Data you provide to answer
    your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to
    obtain access to the
    Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services
    and to monitor your use of
    such services. Rev and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &quot;Related Companies&quot;)
    may also use
    your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through
    the Site to help us
    improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and
    to improve the Services.
    Rev and its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with you regarding
    the Services
    or to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each
    marketing
    communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to &quot;opt-out&quot;
    of receiving future
    marketing communications. Note however that as user of the Service you cannot opt-out
    of some administrative
    communications that are reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service
    notifications. In
    addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications
    or you wish to have your
    name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.
</p>
<p>
    If Rev intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with
    this Privacy Policy,
    you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal
    Data is
    collected.
</p>

<h2>Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information:</h2>
<p>
    Rev is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information
    to be a vital part
    of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we
    may share your Personal Data
    with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or
        buy businesses or assets.
        In the event of a corporate sale, merger,
        reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred
        assets.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Related Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our
        Related Companies for
        purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> Rev, like many businesses,
        sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples
        of such functions
        include mailing information, maintaining databases, shipping and fulfillment and processing
        payments.
        When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide
        them with the
        information that they need to perform their
        specific function.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> Rev may disclose your Personal Data if required
        to do so by
        law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
        obligation, (ii)
        protect and defend the rights or property of Rev, (iii) act in urgent circumstances
        to protect the
        personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Choices:</h2>
<p>
    You can use the Site without providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide
    any Personal Data, you may
    not be able to use certain Services.
</p>

<h2>Exclusions:</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Data collected by Rev other than
    Personal Data
    collected through the Site or Services. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to any unsolicited
    information you
    provide to Rev through this Site or through any other means. This includes, but is not
    limited to,
    information posted to any public areas of the Site, such as bulletin boards (collectively,
    &quot;Public Areas&quot;), any ideas for new products or modifications to existing
    products, and other
    unsolicited submissions (collectively, &quot;Unsolicited Information&quot;). All Unsolicited
    Information shall
    be deemed to be non-confidential and Rev shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose,
    distribute and
    exploit such Unsolicited Information without limitation or attribution.
</p>

<h2>Children:</h2>
<p>
    Rev does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If
    you are under the
    age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the Site. We encourage parents
    and legal guardians to
    monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by instructing
    their children
    never to provide Personal Data on this Site without their permission. If you have reason
    to believe that a
    child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Rev through this Site, please
    contact us, and
    we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
</p>

<h2>Links to Other Web Sites:</h2>
<p>
    This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. This Site may contain links to other
    web sites not operated or
    controlled by Rev (the &quot;Third Party Sites&quot;). The policies and procedures we
    described here
    do not apply to the Third Party Sites. The links from this Site do not imply that Rev
    endorses or has
    reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information
    on their privacy
    policies.
</p>

<h2>Security:</h2>
<p>
    Rev takes reasonable steps to protect the Personal Data provided via the Site from
    loss, misuse, and
    unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no Internet, email
    or other electronic
    transmission is ever fully secure or error free, so you should take special care in
    deciding what information
    you send to us in this way.
</p>

<h2>Other Terms and Conditions:</h2>
<p>
    Your access to and use of this Site is subject to our Terms of Service located at:
    <a href="/about/terms">/about/terms</a>
</p>

<h2>Changes to Rev's Privacy Policy:</h2>
<p>
    The Site and our business may change from time to time. As a result, at times it
    may be necessary for
    Rev to make changes to this Privacy Policy.
    Rev reserves the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time and from
    time to time
    without prior notice. Please review this policy periodically, and especially before
    you provide any Personal
    Data. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued
    use of
    the Site after any changes or revisions to this Privacy Policy shall indicate your agreement
    with the terms of
    such revised Privacy Policy.
</p>

<h2>Access to Information; Contacting Rev:</h2>
<p>
    To keep your Personal Data accurate, current, and complete, please contact us as
    specified below. We will take
    reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Data in our possession that you have
    previously submitted via
    this Site or Services. Please also feel free to contact us if you have any questions

    Privacy Policy or the information practices of this Site.
