        <p>The companies that comprise the Farmers Insurance Group of Companies<sup>&reg;</sup> recognize the importance of respecting the privacy of our policyholders. We at 21st Century Insurance want you to understand what information we collect, how we protect it, and how we may use it. 21st Century Insurance treats your Social Security number (&amp;quotSSN&amp;quot) and all nonpublic personal information (&amp;quotNPI&amp;quot) that identifies you with respect, and in accordance with the applicable Privacy Notice and this Social Security Number Protection Policy. Ensuring that your SSN and other NPI are secure and private is vital to 21st Century Insurance in meeting our goal of providing you with high quality insurance products and services.</p>


        <p>We at 21st Century Insurance value your trust, and we are committed to the responsible protection of your Social Security number. This notice applies to any SSN that 21st Century Insurance collects in the course of our business. 21st Century Insurance uses customers' SSNs to request accurate credit reports in order to properly rate and underwrite policies. We may also collect SSN during the claims process in order to determine Medicare eligibility and/or comply with other Federal reporting requirements. 21st Century Insurance protects the confidentiality of SSNs, including the maintenance of physical and electronic security procedures to guard against unauthorized access to SSNs. We also limit access to SSNs by, among other measures, only granting access to SSNs to our employees who use that information to perform their job-related duties. 21st Century Insurance employees who handle a SSN in violation of a 21st Century Insurance policy or procedure may be subject to discipline, up to and including, termination. In addition, we do not disclose SSNs to third parties, except where required or permitted by law.</p>
