    <h1>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Subsidiary and Affiliated 
      Agencies'<br />Internet Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its subsidiary and affiliated 
      agencies, MTA Metro-North Railroad, MTA Long Island Rail Road, MTA New York 
      City Transit, MTA Bridges and Tunnels, and MTA Capital 
      Construction (collectively the "MTA Agencies") are committed to protecting 
      your privacy when you use the MTA website (the "MTA Website"). Consistent 
      with the provisions of the New York State Internet Security and Privacy 
      Act, the New York State Freedom of Information Law, and the New York State 
      Personal Privacy Protection Law, this Policy describes the MTA Agencies’ 
      privacy practices regarding information collected from users of the MTA 
      Website. </p>
    <p>This Policy describes what information is collected when you access the 
      MTA Website and how that information is used. Because this Policy only applies 
      to the MTA Website itself and not linked websites, you should examine the 
      privacy policy of any other websites that you access from the MTA Website.</p>
    <p>Please carefully read this Policy before submitting any personal information, 
      including your e-mail address, for notification of service updates, initiating 
      an online transaction, providing information with respect to employment 
      opportunities, or for any other reason. Please note that this Policy may 
      change from time to time without special notice to you, so please check 
      back to review the most recent version of this Policy. </p>
    <p>For purposes of this Policy, "personal information" means any information 
      concerning a natural person, which, because of a name, number, symbol, mark, 
      or other identifier, can be used to identify that natural person. The MTA 
      Agencies only collect personal information about you when you provide that 
      information voluntarily by sending an e-mail, initiating an online transaction, 
      or submitting information for employment purposes. The information that 
      is available to us from your visit to an MTA Website depends upon which 
      sections of the website you visit and what actions you take during such 
      visit.</p>
    <h2>Information Collected Automatically When You Visit the MTA&nbsp;Website</h2>
    <p>The MTA Agencies monitor MTA Website user traffic and patterns, and automatically 
      collect certain non-personal information about your visit such as the internet 
      domain name from which you access the MTA Website, the type of browser and 
      operating system you used, the date and time of your visit, the pages you 
      visit, and the referring web site address, if any. This information is used 
      to improve the content of the MTA Website and to help the MTA Agencies understand 
      how users are interacting with the MTA Website. This information is not 
      collected for commercial marketing purposes and the MTA Agencies will not 
      sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from the MTA Website 
      for commercial marketing purposes.</p>
    <h2>Cookies and Web Beacons</h2>
    <p>The MTA Agencies may use cookies to track how you visit certain pages
      on the MTA Website. The use of cookies is a standard practice among Internet
      websites. Cookies are small amounts of data that are sent to your browser
      from our web servers and are stored on your computer’s hard drive, not
      on our site. Cookies collect information that includes the server your
      computer is logged into and your browser type. Cookies used in connection
      with the MTA Website do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive,
      or capture your e-mail address or any other personal information. Accepting
      cookies is required if you want to use certain of the MTA Website functions
      because they are essential for site administration and security.</p>
    <p>From time
      to time, MTA also may use web beacons, alone or in conjunction with cookies,
      to determine what MTA ads your browser is shown, what ads you click and
      other actions you take on the Internet, to help us better provide relevant
      products, services and information to you and to help us effectively measure
      advertising effectiveness.   We also collect information on our website
      through the use of web beacons or 1x1 pixels.   A web beacon is a transparent
      1x1 pixel image that has been placed on a web page and sends a signal when
      a user has visited that page. A web beacon does not contain any personal
      information. No information that is personally identifiable to you is transmitted
      to the third party using the web beacon. The third party is required to
      protect the privacy of the information it receives using Web beacons or
      cookies and is not allowed to use the information it receives for any purpose
      beyond what is necessary to assist us.  We do not sell, rent, trade, or
      otherwise distribute information about you gathered through the web beacons
      or pixels with any third parties.</p>
    <h2>Information Collected When You E-mail the MTA Website, Initiate an Online 
      Transaction, or Submit Information For Employment Purposes</h2>
    <p>During your visit to the MTA Website you may place an order for goods or 
      services, submit an inquiry, and/or submit information concerning opportunities 
      for employment. The information, including personal information, volunteered 
      by you in initiating such transactions is used by one or more of the MTA 
      Agencies to provide you with goods, services, and information or to undertake 
      the employment review process. The information collected by one or more 
      of the MTA Agencies may be shared among them and disclosed by them for those 
      purposes that may be reasonably ascertained from the nature and terms of 
      the transaction in connection with which the information was submitted. 
      The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and the 
      MTA Agencies will not sell or otherwise disclose the information collected 
      from the MTA Website for commercial marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>The MTA Agencies do not collect any personal information about you during 
      your visit to the MTA Website unless you provide that information voluntarily 
      by sending an e-mail or initiating an online transaction such as filling 
      out a registration or completing an order form, or for purposes of employment. 
      You may choose not to send us an e-mail, register online for a service, 
      complete an online order form, or submit information for employment purposes. 
      While your choice not to participate in these activities may limit your 
      ability to receive specific services or products through the MTA Website, 
      it will not prevent you from requesting services or products from the MTA 
      Agencies by other means and will normally not have an impact on your ability 
      to take advantage of other features of the MTA Website, including browsing 
      or downloading most publicly available information.</p>
    <p>The MTA Agencies do not knowingly collect personal information from children 
      or create profiles of children through the MTA Website. Users are cautioned, 
      however, that the collection of personal information submitted in an e-mail 
      or through an online transaction will be treated as though it was submitted 
      by an adult, and may, unless exempted by federal or state law, be subject 
      to public access. The MTA Agencies strongly encourage parents and teachers 
      to be involved in children's Internet activities and to provide guidance 
      whenever children are requested or otherwise have the opportunity to provide 
      personal information online.</p>
    <h2>Disclosure of Information Collected Through The MTA Website</h2>
    <p>The collection of information through the MTA Website and the disclosure 
      of that information are subject to the provisions of the New York State 
      Internet Security and Privacy Act. The MTA Agencies will only collect personal 
      information through the MTA Website or disclose personal information collected 
      through the MTA Website if the user has consented to the collection or disclosure 
      of such personal information or under the circumstances described below. 
      The voluntary disclosure of personal information to the MTA Agencies by 
      the user, including participation in an online transaction, whether solicited 
      or unsolicited, constitutes consent to the collection and disclosure of 
      the information by the MTA Agencies for the purposes reasonably ascertainable 
      from the nature and terms of the disclosure.</p>
    <p>However, the MTA Agencies may collect or disclose personal information 
      without user consent if the collection or disclosure is: (1) necessary to 
      perform the statutory duties of the MTA Agencies, or necessary for the MTA 
      Agencies to operate a program authorized by law, or authorized by state 
      or federal statute or regulation; (2) made pursuant to a court order or 
      required by law; (3) required for the purpose of validating the identity 
      of the user; or (4) of information to be used solely for statistical purposes 
      that is in a form that cannot be used to identify any particular person.</p>
    <p>Further, the disclosure of information, including personal information, 
      collected through the MTA Website is subject to the provisions of the New 
      York State Freedom of Information Law and the New York State Personal Privacy 
      Protection Law.</p>
    <p>The MTA Agencies may disclose personal information to federal or state 
      or local law enforcement authorities to enforce the MTA Agencies’ rights 
      against unauthorized access or attempted unauthorized access to the MTA 
      Agencies’ information technology assets or against other inappropriate use 
      of the MTA Website or other MTA property.</p>
    <h2>Retention of Information Collected Through the MTA Website</h2>
    <p>The information collected through the MTA Website is retained by the MTA 
      Agencies in accordance with the applicable records retention and disposition 
      requirements of New York law. Information concerning these records retention 
      and disposition schedules may be obtained at <a href="http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/records/mr_pub_mi1_part1.shtml">
      <u>http://www.archives.nysed.gov/a/records/mr_pub_mi1_part1.shtml</u></a> 
      and by contacting the MTA Website’s Privacy Compliance Officer listed below.</p>
    <h2>Access to and Correction of Personal Information Collected Through the 
      MTA Website</h2>
    <p>Any user may submit a request to the MTA Website’s Privacy Compliance Officer 
      to determine whether personal information pertaining to that user has been 
      collected and retained through the MTA Website. Any such request shall be 
      made in writing to the address below and must be accompanied by reasonable 
      proof of identity of the user. Reasonable proof of identity may include 
      verification of a signature, inclusion of an identifier generally known 
      only to the user, or other appropriate identification. Such a request should 
      be mailed to the MTA Website Privacy Compliance Officer:</p>
    <div class="box" style="width: 250px;"> 
      <p>MTA Website Privacy Compliance Officer<br />
        Metropolitan Transportation Authority<br />
        347 Madison Avenue<br />
        New York, New York 10017</p>
    </div>
    <p>The MTA Website Privacy Compliance Officer shall, within (5) business days 
      of the date of the receipt of a proper request: (i) provide access to the 
      personal information; (ii) deny access in writing, explaining the reasons 
      therefor; or (iii) acknowledge the receipt of the request in writing, stating 
      the approximate date when the request will be granted or denied, which date 
      shall not be more than thirty (30) days from the date of the acknowledgment.</p>
    <p>In the event that the MTA Agencies have collected and retained personal 
      information pertaining to a user through the MTA Website and that information 
      is to be provided to the user pursuant to the user's request, the MTA Agencies 
      shall inform the user of his or her right to request that the personal information 
      be amended or corrected under the procedures set forth in section 95 of 
      the New York Public Officers Law.</p>
    <h2>Confidentiality and Integrity of Personal Information Collected Through 
      the MTA Website</h2>
    <p>The MTA Agencies are strongly committed to protecting personal information 
      collected through the MTA Website against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 
      Consequently, the MTA Agencies limit employee access to personal information 
      collected through the MTA Website to only those employees who need access 
      to the information in the performance of their official duties. Employees 
      who have access to this information are required to maintain its confidentiality 
      and disclose it only as permitted under this Policy. </p>
    <p>In addition, the MTA Agencies have implemented procedures to safeguard 
      the integrity of their information technology assets, including, but not 
      limited to, authenticating, monitoring, auditing, and encrypting. Security 
      procedures have been integrated into the design, implementation, and day-to-day 
      operations of the MTA Website as part of our continuing commitment to the 
      security of electronic content as well as the electronic transmission of 
      information. </p>
    <p>As an additional security measure, many areas of the MTA Website require 
      the use of a User ID and Password to help protect your confidential information. 
      This allows the MTA Agencies to verify who you are, thereby allowing you 
      access to your account information, and preventing unauthorized access. 
      You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password 
      and account, and agree to immediately notify the MTA Agencies of any unauthorized 
      use of your password or account or any other breach of security. </p>
    <p>For website security purposes and to maintain the availability of the MTA 
      Website for all users, the MTA Agencies employ software to monitor traffic 
      to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise 
      damage the MTA Website.</p>
    <p>One or more of the MTA Agencies have retained independent contractors or 
      third party service providers to perform special contract functions in connection 
      with the MTA Website, including, but not limited to, providing e-commerce 
      services, computer programming, storing and managing customer information, 
      processing transactions, and providing advice about and support of our products 
      and services. As users navigate the MTA Website they may not be able to 
      identify which services are provided by such contractors or providers and 
      which services are provided directly by the MTA Agencies. These third party 
      contractors or service providers may obtain and store and/or process your 
      personal information on their own computer systems. The contracts between 
      the MTA Agencies and these entities require them to treat your personal 
      information securely.</p>
    <h2>Links</h2>
    <p>In order to provide users with certain information, the MTA Agencies provide 
      links to the websites of local, State, and federal government agencies, 
      and to the websites of other public and private organizations. A link does 
      not constitute an endorsement of the content, viewpoint, accuracy, opinions, 
      policies, products, services, or accessibility of that website. Once you 
      link from the MTA Website to another website you are subject to the terms 
      and conditions of that website, including, but not limited to, its Internet 
      privacy policy, if any.</p>
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The information provided in this Policy should not be construed as giving 
      business, legal, or other advice, or warranting as fail proof, the security 
      of information provided through the MTA Website.</p>
    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

      the MTA Website Privacy Compliance Officer via email</a></em></p>
