            <p align="left"><strong>Cookies.</strong> Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computers hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.</p>
            <ul class="ts-list">
                <li><strong>Session Cookies.</strong> Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistent Cookies.</strong> Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising both on our Site and on third-party sites.</li>

            <p align="left">Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.

            <p align="left">Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computers hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers, to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded.</p>

            <p align="left">We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services. We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance, and user experiences. These entities may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services. We do not share your personal information with these third parties. To learn more about Google’s privacy practices, please review the Google Privacy Policy at https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/.

If you do not want us to collect this information, you can opt out of receiving emails from use (links in the emails provide opt out options).</p>
            <div class="clear-0" id="Networks"></div>
            <h2 class="product-copy">Third-Party Ad Networks</h2>
            <p align="left">We sometimes work with other third-party companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet.  These companies may collect information about your online interaction with us, including advertising.  Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to our Site as well as other websites. This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements by displaying ads for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third partys specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Third-Party Ad Networks.</strong> We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on third-party websites or other media (e.g., social networking platforms). This enables us and these third parties to target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third-party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you. These third-party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information, including personal information, about you.</p>
            <p align="left">Users in the United States may opt out of many third-party ad networks. For example, you may go to the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Consumer Choice Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by DAA companies. You may also go to the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) Consumer Opt-Out Page for information about opting out of interest-based advertising and their choices regarding having information used by NAI members. If you are a user in the European Union, you may opt-out of certain third party cookies that we and other websites may use for targeted advertising through the European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA) Your Online Choices Page or www.aboutads.info.</p>
            <p align="left">Opting out from one or more companies listed on the DAA Consumer Choice Page, the NAI Consumer Opt-Out Page, or the EDAA Your Online Choices Page will opt you out from those companies’ delivery of interest-based content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any advertising through our Site or on other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing (i.e., contextually based ads). Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you opt out on the DAA, NAI, or EDAA websites, your opt out may not be effective. Additional information is available on the DAA’s website at www.aboutads.info or the NAI’s website at www.networkadvertising.org.</p>

                <li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to perform a contract or take steps to enter into a contract with you (for example when you choose to purchase software from us); or</li>
                <li>Our use of your personal information is in our legitimate interest as a commercial organization (for example in order to make improvements to our products and services and to provide you with information you request); you have a right to object to processing as explained in the section below titled Your Legal Rights;</li>
                <li>Our use of your personal information is necessary to comply with a relevant legal or regulatory obligation that we have (for example, where we are required to disclose personal information to a court); or</li>
                <li>Our use of your personal information is in accordance with your consent (for example, when your consent to the receipt of marketing communications is required by local law.</li>
            </ul>

            <p align="left">If you would like to find out more about the legal bases on which we process personal information, please contact us using the details below.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Your Legal Rights.</strong> Subject to certain exemptions, and in some cases dependent upon the processing activity we are undertaking, European Union individuals have certain rights in relation to your personal information:</p>
            <p align="left"><i>Right to access, correct, and delete your personal information:</i>You have the right to request access to the personal information that we hold about you and:(a) the source of your personal information; (b) the purposes, legal basis and methods of processing; (c) the data controller’s identity; and (d) the entities or categories of entities to whom your personal information may be transferred.</p>
            <p align="left">You also have the right to request that we delete your information. </p>
            <p align="left">We are not required to comply with your request to erase personal information if the processing of your personal information is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise, or deference of legal claims. </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Right to restrict the processing of your personal information: </i>You have the right to restrict the use of your personal information when (i) you contest the accuracy of the data; (ii) the use is unlawful but you do not want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer need the personal information for the relevant purposes, but we require it for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or (iv) you have objected to our personal information use justified on our legitimate interests verification as to whether we have a compelling interest to continue to use your data. </p>
            <p align="left">We can continue to use your personal information following a request for restriction, where:</p>
            <ul class="ts-list">
                <li>we have your consent; or</li>
                <li>to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or</li>
                <li>to protect the rights of another natural or legal person. </li>
            </ul>


            <p align="left"><i>Right to data portability: </i>To the extent that we process your information (i) based on your consent or under a contract; and (ii) through automated means, you have the right to receive such personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or you can ask to have it transferred directly to another data controller. </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Right to object to the processing of your personal information: </i>You can object to any processing of your personal information which has our legitimate interests as its legal basis, if you believe your fundamental rights and freedoms outweigh our legitimate interests. If you raise an objection, we have an opportunity to demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate interests which override your rights and freedoms. </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Right to obtain a copy of personal information safeguards used for transfers outside your jurisdiction: </i>You can ask to obtain a copy of, or reference to, the safeguards under which your personal information  is transferred outside of the EEA. </p>
            <p align="left"><i>Right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority: </i>You have a right to lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority if you have concerns about how we are processing your personal information. </p>
            <p align="left">We ask that you please attempt to resolve any issues with us first, although you have a right to contact your supervisory authority at any time.  </p>
            <p align="left"><i>How to Exercise Your Rights: </i>If you would like to exercise any of the rights described above, please send us a request to gdpr@telestream.net. In your message, please indicate the right you would like to exercise and the information that you would like to access, review, correct, or delete. </p>
            <p align="left">We may ask you for additional information to confirm your identity and for security purposes, before disclosing the personal information requested to you. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law, for instance if your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive. We may not always be able to fully address your request, for example if it would impact the duty of confidentiality we owe to others, or if we are legally entitled to deal with the request in a different way.</p>
            <p align="left"><i>If we process your information as a Data Processor:</i>For certain activities where we provide services to our customers, we act only on the instruction of those corporate customers.  In those situations, the corporate customer is the Data Controller for that purpose.  Where we process your data in our capacity as a data processor on behalf of the Data Controller, the processing of your data will not be governed by this Policy, but you can contact the customer directly to learn about their processing of your information and to exercise your rights, or we will forward your request directly to our corporate customers.</p>
            <p align="left"><strong>Cross-border Transfer of Information.</strong> Telestream generally maintains servers and systems in the United States hosted by third party service providers. We also may subcontract the processing of your data to, or otherwise share your data with, other third parties in the United States or countries other than your country of residence. As a result, where the personal information that we collect through the Site, Services, or in connection with providing services to or administering our relationship with a corporate customer is transferred to and processed in the United States or anywhere else outside the European Economic Area (EEA) for the purposes described above, we will take steps to ensure that the information receives the same level of protection as if it remained within the EEA, including entering into data transfer agreements, using the EU Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses, or by relying on certification schemes such as the EU - US Privacy Shield. You have a right to details of the mechanisms under which your data is transferred outside the EEA. </p>
