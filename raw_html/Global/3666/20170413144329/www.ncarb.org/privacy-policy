<p>Last Updated: March 2016</p>

<p>The National Council of Architectural Registration Boards (referenced herein as “we,” “us,” or “NCARB” or with “our) has developed this policy statement (the “Privacy Policy”) to assist end users (referenced herein as “you” or “User” or with “your”) in understanding NCARB’s use of personally identifiable information (“PII”) collected through NCARB’s website located at <a href="http://www.ncarb.org">www.ncarb.org</a> (the “Website”). NCARB reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time to address changes to its information collection, disclosure, use practices, or changes in law. If NCARB makes changes to this Privacy Policy, NCARB will post those changes at this location and provide notice of any material changes so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Please review this Privacy Policy on a periodic basis.</p>

<p><strong>1. INFORMATION WE COLLECT.</strong></p>

<ul><li><strong>Technical information gathered automatically.</strong> You can generally browse parts of our Website without telling us who you are or revealing any PII. However, the Website hosting company collects aggregate or anonymous information from you when you use our Website. This information may include data such as your browser type, your ISP or operating system, the URL of previous websites you visited, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address.</li>
	<br /><li><strong>Personal information you provide to us.</strong> However, in certain sections of the Website, you may have the opportunity to register for an online account; apply for an NCARB Record; renew your Record; request that your Record be transmitted to registration boards; review your Record summary report (for applicants in initial Record compilation stages); submit information about work experience, employers, supervisors, work performance, and supplementary information through the electronic Employment Verification System; review your AXP Periodic Assessment Reports; check your Record status and expiration date; and order publications and other services and products offered by NCARB. Many of these activities require you to provide personal information about yourself to NCARB. We may also collect personal information that you provide in the material you post to our Website or include in your correspondence with us. Please note that we may supplement the information you provide to us with data we receive from third parties, such as schools, employers, Member Boards, or address verification services.</li>
</ul><p><strong>2. USE OF INFORMATION.</strong> Parts of the Website are informational in nature and publicly available to all users. Consequently, until you participate in surveys, blogs, forums, programs, or events; register; log in to an account; or request information from NCARB, you are able to browse the Website without providing any PII, although your browser may tell us what type of computer and operating system you are using, as well as other kinds of technical information. Below, NCARB sets forth in more detail how we use your PII.</p>

<ul><li><strong>Personal and Contact Information: </strong>We may use your personal information for any of the following reasons: creating an online account for you on our Website; verifying your identity when you use certain areas or features of our Website; internal record keeping; completing your online order and sending or providing you with the products or services you requested; sharing with third party service providers who may provide services to our Users or perform other services on our behalf (e.g. to process payments or ship products you may have ordered); improving our Website’s content; general administration; providing customer support; targeting our Website content to your preferences; periodically sending promotional information regarding new products, programs, services, special offers, or other information that we think you might find of interest from NCARB; contacting you via e-mail, telephone, facsimile, or mail to deliver certain services or information you have requested; or more effectively facilitating the promotion of goods and services to appropriate target audiences based on your demographic information (i.e., age, postal code, city or state, Record holder status, and other similar information). NCARB endeavors at all times to maintain a Candidate’s (an applicant pursuing a license to become an architect by taking the Architect Registration Examination®), or Record holder’s personal information as confidential. Candidate scores are held in confidence, available only to the Candidate and to persons or organizations authorized by a Candidate. We may now or in the future allow access to Candidate scores online. Candidates must consent to have their scores made available to authorized third parties.</li>
	<li><strong>Demographic Information:</strong> NCARB may share demographic data on an aggregated basis, which will not identify any particular user, with NCARB's members, partners, and affiliates for advertising or other technical or business purposes We may share demographic data on an aggregated basis, which does not personally identify you, with our members, affiliates, agents, and partners for various administrative and research purposes and for advertising or other technical or business purposes.</li>
	<li><strong>Survey Results:</strong> NCARB may share survey results collected through the Website with its business partners, members, and affiliates and/or the general public, the news media, and with the U.S. federal and state governments, not only for business or marketing purposes or as may be required by law, but also to participate in government programs and initiatives.</li>
	<li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> NCARB will use this information to facilitate educational opportunities, participation, or otherwise allow access to or use of certain information, tools, or features and for improving the Website’s performance, usability, and design. NCARB may also use technical information to help diagnose problems with NCARB’s servers, analyze Website usage trends, track user movements on the Website, and otherwise manage and monitor the Website.</li>
	<li><strong>Business Transactions:</strong> If we go through a business transition such as a merger or acquisition by another entity involving the sale of all or a portion of our assets, your PII may be one of the assets that is transferred. In the event a transaction of this kind occurs that results in the transfer of PII, NCARB will notify you via e-mail and/or place a prominent notice on the Website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control, as well as possible changes to this Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li><strong>Legal Action:</strong> We may also disclose PII to law enforcement or a government agency in response to a search warrant, subpoena, or other legally valid inquiry or order, or to an investigative body when required or permitted by law. We may also disclose your personal information where necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; to protect our interests or preserve our rights; to protect the safety, rights, or property of NCARB’s users; or as otherwise permitted or required by law.</li>
</ul><p><strong>3. COOKIES &amp; COMPUTER-RELATED INFORMATION.</strong> We may collect information from you by using cookies, web beacons, tags, login files, and/or other similar data collection or tracking techniques to enhance and/or monitor your experience while using the Website. Cookies and other similar computer-related data tracking generally collect small pieces of information stored on a User’s computer containing information about the User. Cookies and other similar computer-related data tracking help us analyze web traffic, provide user data for a particular webpage, and allow web applications to respond to you as an individual, tailoring their operations to your needs, likes, and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences. Many consider the use of cookies and such identifiers to be an industry standard measure. Consequently, most web browsers automatically accept cookies or allow other identifiers. If you would prefer to prevent your computer from accepting our cookies or allowing identifiers, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse cookies or surf anonymously. Please note, however, that if you choose to have your browser refuse cookies or surf anonymously, you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our online features or access certain sections of our Website.<br /><strong>4. LINKS TO OTHER SITES.</strong> Our Website may contain hyperlinks or gateways (whether through banner advertisements or otherwise) to other sites that we do not own or operate. Also, links to our Website may be featured on third party websites on which we advertise. We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to the users of our Website. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. You should be aware that these external or third party sites may collect PII and are not controlled by NCARB and therefore are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy statements, notices, and Terms of Use of any other websites that you visit.<br /><strong>5. COLLECTION OF INFORMATION BY THIRD PARTY WEBSITES.</strong> We sometimes may offer content (e.g., promotions) that is sponsored by or co-branded with an identified third party. In these instances, the third party may obtain information that you voluntarily submit to participate in a site activity. We have no control over the third party’s use of this information. The Website will notify you at the time of information collection if a third party will obtain such information.<br /><strong>6. YOUR CHOICES.</strong> We may use the PII we collect from you to provide requested information or materials or to offer you products and services that may be of interest to you. You can review, correct, and delete some of your personal information (such as your contact information) by logging into the Website and navigating to your preferences page in your NCARB Record (if applicable). You may opt-out of receiving commercial e-mails from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link in every promotional e-mail we send. You may contact us by phone at 202/879-0520, email at <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncarb.org">customerservice@ncarb.org</a> or by mail at the following address to request that your personal information be updated, corrected, or deleted: NCARB, Attn: Customer Service, 1801 K Street, NW, Suite 700K, Washington, DC 20006.<br /><strong>7. SECURITY.</strong> NCARB uses commercially reasonable procedural and technological security measures which are reasonably designed to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. Please be aware, however, that no method of data transmission over the Internet or method of electronic data storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee (and thus you should not expect) the absolute security, integrity, and privacy of any or all information exchanged between you and us through the Website. We make no warranty, express, implied, or otherwise, that we will prevent unauthorized access to or use of your PII.<br /><strong>8. CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS</strong> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users of the Website who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please write to us at the address below.<br /><strong>9. GOVERNING LAW.</strong> This Privacy Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia. The Website and the servers that host the Website are located in the United States. Any information you provided will be transferred to the United States. By visiting and using the Website and submitting PII thereto, you therefore authorize this transfer of your PII to the United States. If any part of this Privacy Policy is determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to applicable law, then the invalid or unenforceable provision or part will be deemed suspended by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision or part and the remainder of this Privacy Policy shall continue in full force and effect.<br /><strong>10. CONTACTING US.</strong> If you have any questions, comments or feedback regarding this Privacy Policy, please contact by mail: NCARB, 1801 K Street, NW, Suite 700K, Washington, DC 20006, by phone: 202-783-6500, or by email: <a href="mailto:customerservice@ncarb.org">customerservice@ncarb.org</a>.
