Avid may also make the winner's names public, as provided in the applicable rules, or as required by law. Avid may also use that information as described above. In some instances, the applicable rules may contain additional or different uses for the information you provide; please be sure to review those rules carefully before entering.</p>
<p>Avid may permit a third party to sponsor a survey, contest, sweepstakes, or other similar event ("third party event") with Avid, such as through posting it on the site. Such third party events are governed solely by any applicable rules, and may require you to provide information to that third party as a condition for participation. While Avid will treat any information it receives in accordance with this Privacy Policy, Avid is not responsible for the information gathered by that third party, and Avid reminds you to review the rules and privacy policies separately applicable to those third party events.</p>
<h4>CHILDREN</h4>
<p>Some of Avid’s websites may appeal to or be intended for children; however, we do not wish to receive data from children. We encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites their children visit. No information should be submitted to, or posted at, Avid’s website by visitors under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. For sites that are intended for use by children we have put in place additional privacy practices which are described on those sites.</p>
<h4>SECURITY</h4>
<h4>General Issues</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, this site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. No security measures are 100% effective and Avid does not warrant the security of your personal information.&nbsp; Since the site under general usage does not collect financial information, Avid uses the standard internet connections for those general usage portions of the site, without secured sockets.</p>
<h4>Specific Services</h4>
<p>This site may provide certain additional, optional services that may use additional security measures to protect the information, such as financial information, provided by you to obtain the service. Those additional security measures may vary, depending upon the particular service offered. You will be informed of any specific security measures at the time you register for a particular service. Please review that information for further detail.</p>
<h4>Site Registration</h4>
<p>In some cases, you may be prompted to register with the site to undertake a particular site activity or obtain a particular service. As part of that registration, you may be asked to choose your own password. Avid reminds you to protect your password, and not provide it to others to use. Allowing others to access and use your account and password can compromise the security of your information. Avid disclaims any responsibility or obligation for your decision to provide your password to others.</p>
<h4>CHANGES TO THIS POLICY</h4>
<p>If and when Avid makes changes to this site and its products and services, Avid may have to update this Privacy Policy Statement to better reflect those changes. Because changes to this site or updates to this Privacy Policy Statement may occur, you should review this Privacy Policy Statement from time to time. Remember, your decision to continue using this site after this Privacy Policy Statement is updated will signify that you have agreed to any new terms.</p>

If you wish to remove your information from the site registration database and no longer receive future communications or use any services, you may do so through any of the methods described below.

<h4>NOTICE TO EUROPEAN USERS</h4>
<p>Please note that the information you enter on the site or otherwise provide to Avid Technology, or its subsidiaries or divisions, may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, for purposes of processing, by Avid Technology, Inc. a company located in Burlington, Massachusetts, U.S.A., or its subsidiaries or Avid's subsidiaries or divisions, or authorized partners, located worldwide, in order to provide this site and its services to you. You are advised that the United States uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation.

<p>Article 26 of the European Union's Data Directive allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection.</p>
<p>By agreeing to this Policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States and the processing of that information as described in this Policy</p>
