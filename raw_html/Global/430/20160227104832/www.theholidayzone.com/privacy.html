		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> gathers two types of information about users:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys:<br>

				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Information <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. <br>
				</font>
		</ul>
		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> Gathers User Information In The Following Processes:</font></p>
		<ul>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Optional Voluntary Information<br>
					</b><br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We offer or may someday offer the following free services, which require some type of voluntary submission of personal information by users:</font>

		<ol>
			<ol>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Electronic newsletters policy (Dispatches)<br>
						W</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">e will offer a free electronic newsletter to users. <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the link provided in every newsletter that points users to the subscription management page. Users can also subscribe to the newsletters at the time of registration.<br>
						<br>
					</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Message boards/forums policy<br>
					</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Users of the site's Message Boards and Forums must register separately for these services (both are free of charge) in order to post messages, although they needn't register to visit the site. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password, and email address.<br>
						<br>
					</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Polling<br>
						We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> may use a system to &quot;tag&quot; users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.<br>
						<br>
					</font>
				<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Surveys<br>
						<A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience.

We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.</font>

			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Usage tracking<br>
					</b><br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> tracks user traffic patterns throughout our site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).<br>
					<br>
					<A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms that users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.<br>
					<br>
				</font>
			<li><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><b>Cookies<br>
					</b><br>
				</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">We may place a text file called a &quot;cookie&quot; in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided.

		<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular"><A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.<br>
				<br>
				As stated above, we use information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and to enable users to participate in polls, surveys, message boards, and forums. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (depending on the newsletter), and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. <A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers, sponsors or partners.<br>
				<br>
				When we use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in Search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.<br>
				<br>
				<A HREF="http://www.theholidayzone.com">The Holiday Zone</a> creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</font></p>
		<h2><font face="Arial,Helvetica,Geneva,Swiss,SunSans-Regular">Sharing of the Information</font></h2>
