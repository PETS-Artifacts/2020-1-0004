<p>This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) describes how Veritas Health, LLC (“Veritas Health”), as a data controller, collects and uses personal data about you when you visit and use any of our websites, or when you correspond or otherwise communicate with us.
This Policy applies to information we collect about you on any of our websites (collectively, the “Websites”), including the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.veritashealth.com">Veritashealth.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.spine-health.com">Spine-health.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.arthritis-health.com">Arthritis-health.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.sports-health.com">Sports-health.com</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pain-health.com">Pain-health.com</a></li>

</ul>

<p>In this Policy, “we,” “our” and “us” means Veritas Health, and “you” or “your” means any person who visits the Websites or otherwise corresponds with us.</p>

<p>Veritas Health is committed to maintaining the privacy of your online information; it is our priority to build your trust and confidence. Internet privacy is an issue that we take very seriously.</p>

<p>It is important for you to know what information is collected about you, what options you have concerning your information, how that information is used, with whom the information is shared, how we protect your information, and finally, how to contact us if you have additional questions or concerns.</p>

<p>We encourage you to take some time and read this entire Policy. This Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other companies or organizations to which we may link or who may link to us. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third party websites.</p>

<p>In order to post content to our Websites or receive newsletters, you will be required to register an account.  As part of the account registration process, you will be required to affirmatively consent to the terms of this Policy.  By checking the appropriate boxes and clicking “I accept,” you agree that you have read and understand this Policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices (including the uses, disclosures, processing and transfers to third countries outside of the European Union of information about you by Veritas) that are described in this Policy. Kindly note that any consent you provide will be entirely voluntary. HOWEVER, IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS POLICY, THEN YOU SHOULD NOT USE, AND ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO USE THE WEBSITES.</p>

<h3>What Information we collect</h3>
<p>Veritas Health may collect a variety of personal data about you. </p>
<p>Personal data means information that directly identifies you (such as your name, address, or email address) or data that could be used to indirectly identify you (such an IP address or browser agents). You can browse our Websites without submitting your personal data to us. However, there are circumstances in which you may supply us with your personal data, including when you subscribe to our newsletters, and other content; complete a survey, participate in market research, upload content in our online forums or on social media; or when you seek employment at Veritas Health.  The ways that Veritas Health collects information from you are described below.</p>

<h3>How we collect information</h3>
<p>Veritas Health collects personal data in the following ways:</p>

<h5>Registration </h5>

<p>Access to some of our services, such as online forums on our Websites, may be limited to users who have registered an account with us. When you sign up for an account, we collect the personal data you submit to us through the registration process. Some of our tools do not retain your personal data, while others store your personal data in accordance with this Policy. </p>

<h5>Social Media</h5>

<p>When you interact with Veritas on a social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, or LinkedIn, we may collect the personal data that you make available to us on that page or account including your social media account ID. However, we comply with the privacy policies of the corresponding social media platform and we will only collect and store such personal data that we are permitted to collect by those social media platforms.</p>

<h5>Newsletters &amp; Emails to You</h5>

<p>You have the option of providing us with personal data in order to receive recurring informational and/or promotional newsletters via email from Veritas Health and/or directly from third parties.  We collect the personal data you provide to us when you sign up to receive these electronic communications from us (such as name, e-mail address, etc.) </p>

<h5>Market Research</h5>

<p>From time to time, Veritas Health may conduct online research surveys through email invitations, pop-up surveys, and online focus groups. When participating in a survey, we may ask you to enter personal data. The personal data you submit in a survey may be used by Veritas Health for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising, or programs.</p>

<h5>Health Communities, Blogs & Other Public Forums</h5>

<p>Veritas Health features public forums where users with similar interests or medical conditions can share information and support one another. We may also offer online discussions moderated by healthcare experts from time to time. </p>

<p>Any information (including personal data) you share in any online community, including forums or online discussions, is open to the public. You should always consider your online environment before posting any personal data in any public forum. What you post can be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may be used by others in ways we cannot control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. Your post may potentially show up in third-party search engines.</p>

<h5>Emails You Send to Veritas Health</h5>
<p>When you send us personal data in your written communications with us, we may retain that personal data subject to this Policy.</p>

<h5>Employment</h5>

<p>If you apply for a position at Veritas Health, we will use the personal data you provide to assess your qualifications for a particular position. The information you provide will not be shared with any third-parties and will only be used for employment purposes.</p>

<h5>Using Cookies and other Automatic Collection Methods</h5>
<p>We and third parties we work with may collect information from the computer, tablet, phone, or other device that you use to access our Websites (such as IP addresses), or that you use to open an email from us. This collection includes automatically collected information, and does not include personal data that directly identifies you unless you provide it through our Websites or you choose to share it with us. </p>

<p>Automatic collection methods we use include cookies (which may be session-based or persistent, and typically are small data files that are stored on your hard drive or in connection with your Internet browser) and web beacons (small images embedded into websites or emails that send information about your computer, tablet, phone, or other device when you visit our website, or open an email we send to you) or pixel tags.  </p>

<p>We use Google Analytics to measure and report how users interact with our Websites, emails and advertisements to analyze the traffic to our websites and for the other purposes set forth in the “How We Use Your Information” Section below.  For more information about Google Analytics and how it collects and processes data, please see “How Google Uses Data When You Use Our Partners’ Sites or Apps.” For more information about how Google Analytics uses cookies to measure user interactions on websites, <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/technologies/">click here</a>. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Site is restricted by Google’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not want your website visit data reported by the Google Analytics JavaScript, you can install the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.  This add-on instructs the Google Analytics JavaScript to prohibit sending visit information to Google Analytics, but does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or in other ways to other website analytics services. <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">Click here</a> if you would like to learn more about the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, and <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">click here</a> to install the opt-out browser add-on.</p>

<h3>How we use your information</h3>
<p>Providing Veritas Health with your personal data helps us serve you better.  Information collected by Veritas Health about you is used by Veritas Health to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Administer your account;</li>
	<li>Provide you with access to particular tools and services;</li>
	<li>Respond to the inquiries you send us and to send you administrative communications about our Websites or services;</li>
	<li>Obtain your feedback about the Websites or our offerings;</li>
	<li>Statistically analyze user behavior and activity, including how frequently areas of the site are visited and how many emails are received and opened;</li>
	<li>Provide you (and people with similar demographic characteristics and interests) with more relevant content or advertising both on our Websites or on other websites that you visit after you leave our Websites;</li>
	<li>Send you personalized emails or secure electronic messages pertaining to your health interests, including news, announcements, reminders, and opportunities from Veritas Health;</li>
	<li>Send you relevant offers and informational materials pertaining to your health interests on behalf of our sponsors;</li>
	<li>Veritas Health may combine personal and non-personal data collected about you by Veritas Health, and may combine this information with information from external sources.</li>
</ul>

<p>Veritas Health uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. We do not use profiling or make any decisions based solely on the automated processing of your personal information. </p>

<h5>Research & Measurement Activities</h5>

<p>Information that Veritas Health collects about you may be combined by Veritas Health with other information available to Veritas Health through third parties for research and measurement purposes, including measuring the effectiveness of content, advertising, or programs. This information from other sources may include age, gender, demographic information, geographic information, personal interests, or other information. We may report aggregate information, which is not able to be identified back to an individual user of our Websites, to our current or prospective advertisers and other business partners.</p>

<p>We do not sell or share any personal data with any third parties, except contractors performing services on our behalf who agree not to use this information received from us for any purpose other than performing services on our behalf.</p>

<h3>How we share your information</h3>
<p>In general, Veritas Health does not share personal data about you with third parties for their own direct marketing or advertising purposes unless you request or consent to such sharing, or as otherwise described below. However, we do share personal data with third parties for the following limited purposes. </p>

<h5>Disclosures to Veritas Health Contractors</h5>
<p>Veritas Health contractors sometimes have limited access to your personal data in the course of providing products or services to Veritas Health. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, data analysis, research, advertising, marketing assistance, and/or content in connection with our operation and maintenance of the Websites. We contractually require that our contractors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Protect the privacy of your personal data consistent with this Policy, and</li>
	<li>Not use or disclose your personal data for any purpose other than providing the limited service or function for Veritas Health.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Advertising</h5>
<p>Veritas Health collects aggregate queries for internal reporting and targeted advertising. We also count, track, and aggregate visitors’ activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites. We may merge information about you into group data, which may then be shared on an aggregated basis with our advertisers, but Veritas Health will not disclose your individual identity or personal data without your permission. When Veritas Health does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one will be able to identify or contact you.</p>

<p>In addition, Veritas Health does not provide third-party access to your personal data except in the aggregate and only after the information has been anonymized and/or without your express permission. The information will be in the form of grouped statistics compiled from our users' answers to survey questions and on-site behavior.</p>

<p>Our advertising partners’ ad server may use cookies when you view pages on our site. These cookies collect anonymous information as a way of measuring the effectiveness of advertising sold on Veritas Health. If you click on an advertisement on Veritas Health and visit a site maintained by one of our sponsors or advertisers, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites. Certain advertiser sites may contain tracking code allowing our ad server systems to capture information about the activity on those sites, e.g., how many people from Veritas Health visited a certain page of the advertiser’s site, how many people from Veritas Health completed a product purchase on that site, etc. Again, this information is used to measure the effectiveness of the advertising on Veritas Health.</p>

<p>Veritas Health does not sell any personal data about you, unless we have your explicit permission to do so.</p>

<h5>Legal Compliance</h5>

<p>We may release personal data to third parties to comply with legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or in response to a physical threat to you or others, to protect property, or defend or assert legal rights.
Parties to a Business Transaction</p>


<h5>Location of Data/Notice to non-US Persons</h5>

<p>Our Websites are hosted and operated in the United States.  In addition, we may further transfer your information outside the United States for the purposes described in this Policy. Those who access or use our Websites from jurisdictions outside the United States do so at their own choice and risk and are solely responsible for compliance with local law. If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere.  While we take certain steps to safeguard your personal data, please note that the United States has NOT been deemed by the European Commission to ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data. Accordingly, the level of safeguards and legal protections provided in the United States or other non-European countries from which you may access our Websites may not be as stringent as that under European Union privacy standards or the privacy laws of some other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction. BY CHECKING THE APPROPRIATE BOX(ES) AND CLICKING “I ACCEPT”, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ACCEPT AND FULLY UNDERSTAND THE RISKS OF, AND EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO, THE TRANSFER, STORAGE AND PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE EUROPEAN UNION BY VERITAS HEALTH IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY.</p>


<h3>How we protect your information</h3>

<p>Veritas Health uses reasonable security measures to protect the confidentiality of personal data under our control and appropriately limit access to it. We use a variety of information security measures to protect your online transactions with us. We anonymize data by removing and replacing personal data with an empty string or blank spaces prior to the form being saved on our servers. Our Websites use encryption technology to protect your personal data you submit via our Websites and during data transport. That being said, Veritas Health cannot guarantee or warrant the security of information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We have taken reasonable steps to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of personal data that you may provide. However, electronic transmissions via the Internet are not necessarily secure from interception, and so we cannot absolutely guarantee the security or confidentiality of such transmissions.</p>

<h3>How long we keep your information</h3>
<p>We will retain your personal data as long as your account is active and/or it is needed to provide you services. At any time, you can remove your personal data or instruct us to remove it. We will retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h3>Your Choices and Access Requests</h3>
<p>We strive to offer you choices about how certain personal data is used and shared. Your choices include:</p>

<h5>Online Advertising</h5>

<p>You can manage third-party advertising preferences for some of the third parties we work with to serve advertising across the Internet by utilizing the choices available at <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp">http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp</a> and <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices">http://www.aboutads.info/choices</a>.
