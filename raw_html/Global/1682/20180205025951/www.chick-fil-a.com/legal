Such messages may include system updates, flash bulletins, Offer confirmations, administrative announcements, special requests and the like and may be sent via notifications in the App, via e-mail, regular mail, or communicated to you on a receipt or display at the time of use of an your One account. </p>
<p>Your participation in any Offer is personal and non-transferable. Offer status and/or individual Offer may not be purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred. There are no membership fees associated with Chick-fil-A One Offers. &nbsp;Offers made via Chick-fil-A One are purely promotional offers. &nbsp;You agree that no portion of your payment for purchases qualifying for any Offer constitutes consideration paid for any Offer.</p>
<p><strong>Offers</strong>. &nbsp;The CFA One Offers are issued on a periodic basis. They are referred to as &lsquo;treats&rsquo; in the App but may appear with different descriptions from time to time. Upon signing up, you will receive notice via the Chick-fil-A One account of your current Offer. &nbsp;Once you activate a Chick-fil-A One account, you progress towards an Offer and are eligible to receive special offers, from time to time. &nbsp;The number, type and frequency of Offers are based on a number of factors, each of which are subject to change, without notice. &nbsp;Those factors may include, without limitation, volume and type of purchases at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, number of visits and frequency of visits to participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, interaction with other Chick-fil-A applications or promotions; or special offers made directly by Chick-fil-A Operators or Chick-fil-A which may include ways to progress toward your next Offer via a special promotion. &nbsp; For Offers that are based on purchases, the following types of purchases at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant qualify: (1) placing and completing a Mobile order for a qualifying purchase through the App; (2) using your Chick-fil-A One Digital Gift Card to complete a purchase or transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; (3) logging into your Chick-fil-A One account online and making an online purchase at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; and (4) or completing a transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant and scanning the digital code linking to your Chick-fil-A One account at checkout.</p>
<p>You must use the App or if placing an online order, be signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account, to complete the qualifying purchase or activity in order for that purchase or activity to count towards your progress to the next qualifying Offer. &nbsp;Benefits applied from any single qualifying purchase or activity may only be credited to one (1) Chick-fil-A One account. &nbsp;The qualifying purchase or activity will be applied to your One account after completion of the qualifying purchase or activity. In certain cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more to be credited. Chick-fil-A shall not be responsible for, or liable to, you, or any person or entity, in any way for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay, error or omission in crediting a qualifying purchase or activity to your Chick-fil-A One account.</p>

<p>Activities which allow progress towards Offers do not count towards and may not be combined with other programs. &nbsp;Activities tied to specific Offers must be fully completed and will only result in one Offer, regardless of the number of times the activity is performed. &nbsp;Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or update these Offers and the qualifying purchases and activities to progress to an Offer from time to time without notice. Certain purchases and transactions do not qualify, including, without limitation: (i) purchases of Chick-fil-A gift cards or gift certificates; (ii) purchases or transactions made using an Offer or other promotional item (such as a Be Our Guest card); or (iii) catering purchases made as a guest (e.g. made while not signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account), whether made in-store, online or through the App. Chick-fil-A is under no obligation to provide you with any particular number of Offer opportunities or special offers. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit enrollment at any time. </p>
<p><strong>Special Offers</strong>: Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, in their sole and absolute discretion, may periodically offer the opportunity for additional Offers on particular transactions or special offers (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Special Offers</strong></span>&rdquo;). Special Offers may also be distributed to you via the App or via e-mail or mail from time to time (based on the information you have in your One account). Special Offers may include periodic promotional offers on food, beverages and merchandise. &nbsp;You must have your App set to receive notifications and/or have opted-in to receive email communications in order to receive promotional and marketing offers. Special Offers may be customized based on your qualifying purchases and preferences.

Special Offers are personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. You may be required to present your Chick-fil-A One account information at the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant in order to redeem Special Offers. Read each offer carefully for specific details, conditions, limitations and restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Redeeming Offers</strong>. &nbsp;To redeem an Offer, you must present the valid Offer in the App at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant (for in-person transactions) or be logged into your Chick-fil-A One account (for in App transactions). Offers are subject to availability and limitations as may be imposed by Chick-fil-A. Determinations regarding redemption of Offers are subject to the discretion of the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant. &nbsp;Only one Offer may be redeemed per transaction. </p>
<p>Once redeemed, the Offer will be indicated as redeemed in your Chick-fil-A One account. Updates to the status of Offers may take 24-48 hours or more to show up in your account. A list of current Offers and redeemed and expired Offers are available under your Chick-fil-A One account. &nbsp;Offers have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash, gift certificates or gift cards. &nbsp;Offers are promotional and do not constitute property of any Chick-fil-A One account holder. &nbsp;Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Offers and limit the number of Offers available.

If you continue to receive our communications after expressing an opt-out preference, please let us know so that we can investigate the situation.</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A reserves the right to suspend or terminate, at Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion, any Chick-fil-A One account if Chick-fil-A believes that the account holder has abused Chick-fil-A One Offers privileges, has violated or acted inconsistently with these Chick-fil-A One Offers Terms and Conditions or applicable law or acted in a manner harmful to our interests. Chick-fil-A further reserves the right to terminate a Chick-fil-A One account that has been inactive for a period of three (3) years or more. &nbsp;You understand and agree that termination by Chick-fil-A of a Chick-fil-A One account will result in in the cancellation of all Offers associated with that account and the inability to earn and/or redeem further Offers, as well &nbsp;as inability to access or use any remaining balances on Digital Gift Cards accessible via your Chick-fil-A One account. &nbsp;Upon termination of your Chick-fil-A One account, Chick-fil-A will not refund any unused balances on Digital Gift Card funds accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account (including via credit back to a credit card from which such funds may have been loaded to the Digital Gift Card), but will upon request at the time of termination of your Chick-fil-A One account transfer any unredeemed Digital Gift Card balances accessible through your Chick-fil-A One account to a physical Chick-fil-A gift card that you may use to make future purchases or gift to a donee of your choosing.</p>

In the event Chick-fil-A elects to terminate Chick-fil-A One Offers, Chick-fil-A will provide a notice of termination in accordance with these Terms, as they may be modified or amended from time to time. In the event of such termination, at Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s election, Chick-fil-A may allow you to redeem any outstanding valid and unexpired Offers at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant until expiration of such Offers. ANY UNREDEEMED AND UNEXPIRED OFFERS SHALL BE CANCELLED AT THE LATER OF (1) THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT OFFERS OR (2) NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER CHICK-FIL-A ONE OFFERS PROGRAM TERMINATION. &nbsp;</p>

        <h3>The Chick-fil-A Franchise System</h3>
<h4>Franchise Legal Notices</h4>
<p>The information contained in this website is not intended as an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, a franchise. It is for information purposes only. As explained below, any offer to sell a franchise by Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“Chick-fil-A”) will be made only after individuals have completed a Chick-fil-A Operator application and qualified to receive a Franchise Disclosure Document. Other qualifications will apply in determining whether you will be offered a Chick-fil-A franchise.<br />
<br />
Through this website, you can submit to Chick-fil-A an Expression of Interest form for a Chick-fil-A franchise opportunity. If you submit an Expression of Interest form, Chick-fil-A will not be obligated to offer you a franchise opportunity. Rather, Chick-fil-A will review and evaluate the information you submit in your Expression of Interest to determine if you meet Chick-fil-A’s preliminary criteria for Operator candidate consideration. If we decide that you meet our preliminary criteria for Operator candidate consideration, you may be given the opportunity to fill out a Chick-fil-A Operator Application. If you are invited to fill out an Operator Application, Chick-fil-A will send you an invitation electronically, which will include information that will allow you to access and submit the Operator Application on-line. Upon receipt of a completed Operator Application, Chick-fil-A reviews the applicant’s candidacy further and determines what next steps are appropriate (i.e., continuation of the selection process or discontinuation of consideration). For those individuals who qualify, an offer to sell a franchise will only be made in conjunction with the delivery of a Chick-fil-A Franchise Disclosure Document.<br />
<br />
There are approximately 22 countries and 15 U.S. states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. These countries are Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada (provinces of Alberta, <span>British Columbia, Manitoba, </span>New Brunswick, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island), China, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Tunisia, the United States of America, and Vietnam. The U.S. states are California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. If you are a resident of one of these states or countries, are receiving this message in one of these states or countries, or intend to operate a franchise in any of these states or countries, we will not offer you a franchise unless and until we have complied with any applicable pre-sale registration and/or disclosure requirements in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>

        <h3>California Supply Chains Act</h3>
<p><a id="supply_chain"></a>California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 Disclosure</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A, Inc. (“CFA”) is committed to legal compliance and ethical conduct for itself and expects the same of its vendors. Thus, CFA’s policy is to only do business with vendors who have certified to CFA that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct, and CFA expects its vendors to take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. Specifically, CFA will not conduct business with vendors employing persons under the age of 14, or in/under prison, indentured or bonded labor, or slave labor; benefitting from human trafficking; using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline; or providing or supplying goods or services tainted by any of the foregoing practices.<br />
<br />
In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, CFA makes the following disclosures:<br />
CFA requires its vendors to certify that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct (including those provisions relating to human trafficking and slavery), and that they take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. To ensure accountability, CFA reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with any vendor who fails to provide such certifications or whose business practices, or the business practices of its own suppliers and subcontractors, are not lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA also reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with vendors who fail to provide written confirmation to CFA that they have a program in place to monitor their suppliers and subcontractors for compliance with law, good ethics, and the principles set forth in CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA reserves the right to conduct verification and audits (including third-party verification and audits) of its suppliers regarding human trafficking and slavery. CFA has conducted general audits of certain of its suppliers, and has not observed violations with respect to human trafficking or slavery issues. CFA is currently considering whether and how to best use third-party supply chain verification and independent unannounced audits with its suppliers. CFA provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on CFA’s business practices, vendor requirements, and CFA’s Vendor Code of Conduct, including those provisions relating to mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery. Employees and management failing to meet CFA standards regarding slavery and trafficking are subject to disciplinary action.</p>
