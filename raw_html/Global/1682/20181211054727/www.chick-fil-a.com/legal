<p>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chick-fil-A One Offers Program</strong></span></p>
<p>
The Chick-fil-A One Offers program is operated by Chick-fil-A and subject to the following additional terms and conditions (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>One Offers Terms</strong></span>&rdquo;). </p>
<p><strong>Eligibility</strong>. &nbsp;Chick-fil-A One Offers (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Offers</strong></span>&rdquo;) are limited to persons residing in the United States who are eligible to use the CFA Online Services and who download the Chick-fil-A Mobile App (the &ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>App</strong></span>&rdquo;) and sign-up for a Chick-fil-A One account. &nbsp;You must be at least 13 years of age to redeem Offers in the Chick-fil-A One Offers program. &nbsp;Some activities may only be available to those who are at least 18 years or age. &nbsp;Chick-fil-A One accounts are limited to one individual per account. &nbsp;Offers are valid only at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants. &nbsp;To signup for a Chick-fil-A One account, download the App &nbsp;to your AndroidTM or iPhone&reg; device and follow the prompts to access account sign-up and/or sign-in page in the App. You can also sign up by following the prompts at <a href="www.one.chick-fil-a.com">www.one.chick-fil-a.com</a> or by creating an online account (i.e. Cow Calendar, Kids Club, etc.). (Note: &nbsp;In order to receive Chick-fil-A One Offers, you must download the app and redeem using the QR Code included in the app. See below for details) &nbsp;You will be required to provide the requested information, including, but not limited to, user name, password, name, and e-mail address. Chick-fil-A may periodically request additional information to help us get to know you better. You agree to provide true and accurate information and to ensure that information provided by you is up-to-date and accurate. Communications with you will be made using contact information most recently provided by you. Chick-fil-A is not responsible for your inability to receive or redeem Offers or other loss arising from your failure to provide and maintain accurate contact information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may send messages from time to time using the contact information provided by you. Such messages may include system updates, flash bulletins, Offer confirmations, administrative announcements, special requests and the like and may be sent via notifications in the App, via e-mail, regular mail, or communicated to you on a receipt or display at the time of use of an your One account. </p>
<p>Your participation in any Offer is personal and non-transferable. Offer status and/or individual Offer may not be purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred. There are no membership fees associated with Chick-fil-A One Offers. &nbsp;Offers made via Chick-fil-A One are purely promotional offers. &nbsp;You agree that no portion of your payment for purchases qualifying for any Offer constitutes consideration paid for any Offer.</p>
<p><strong>Offers</strong>. &nbsp;The CFA One Offers are issued on a periodic basis. They are referred to as &lsquo;treats&rsquo; in the App but may appear with different descriptions from time to time. Upon signing up, you will receive notice via the Chick-fil-A One account of your current Offer. &nbsp;Once you activate a Chick-fil-A One account, you progress towards an Offer and are eligible to receive special offers, from time to time. &nbsp;The number, type and frequency of Offers are based on a number of factors, each of which are subject to change, without notice. &nbsp;Those factors may include, without limitation, volume and type of purchases at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, number of visits and frequency of visits to participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, interaction with other Chick-fil-A applications or promotions; or special offers made directly by Chick-fil-A Operators or Chick-fil-A which may include ways to progress toward your next Offer via a special promotion. &nbsp; For Offers that are based on purchases, the following types of purchases at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant qualify: (1) placing and completing a Mobile order for a qualifying purchase through the App; (2) using your Chick-fil-A One Digital Gift Card to complete a purchase or transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; (3) logging into your Chick-fil-A One account online and making an online purchase at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant; and (4) or completing a transaction at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant and scanning the digital code linking to your Chick-fil-A One account at checkout.</p>
<p>You must use the App or if placing an online order, be signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account, to complete the qualifying purchase or activity in order for that purchase or activity to count towards your progress to the next qualifying Offer. &nbsp;Benefits applied from any single qualifying purchase or activity may only be credited to one (1) Chick-fil-A One account. &nbsp;The qualifying purchase or activity will be applied to your One account after completion of the qualifying purchase or activity. In certain cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more to be credited. Chick-fil-A shall not be responsible for, or liable to, you, or any person or entity, in any way for any losses, costs or expenses incurred by a delay, error or omission in crediting a qualifying purchase or activity to your Chick-fil-A One account.</p>
<p>Offers are purely promotional offers and may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. &nbsp;For free drink or food Offers, some restrictions apply and items are subject to availability at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants. &nbsp;All Offers must be redeemed prior to the stated expiration date for the Offer and in compliance with any other conditions associated with the particular Offer to be valid. &nbsp;It is your responsibility to check your Chick-fil-A One account periodically for Offers and use the Offers prior to the stated expiration date.</p>
<p>Activities which allow progress towards Offers do not count towards and may not be combined with other programs. &nbsp;Activities tied to specific Offers must be fully completed and will only result in one Offer, regardless of the number of times the activity is performed. &nbsp;Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or update these Offers and the qualifying purchases and activities to progress to an Offer from time to time without notice. Certain purchases and transactions do not qualify, including, without limitation: (i) purchases of Chick-fil-A gift cards or gift certificates; (ii) purchases or transactions made using an Offer or other promotional item (such as a Be Our Guest card); or (iii) catering purchases made as a guest (e.g. made while not signed in to your Chick-fil-A One account), whether made in-store, online or through the App. Chick-fil-A is under no obligation to provide you with any particular number of Offer opportunities or special offers. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit enrollment at any time. </p>

Member Tier status is determined annually and a Member must meet the requirements for a particular Member Tier status each Rewards Year or that status will not be maintained.  Points from one Rewards Year do not roll over to a subsequent Rewards Year for purposes of determining Member Tier.  Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or update the number of Points or other actions and requirements needed to earn Member Tier status and benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Redeeming Rewards.</strong> To redeem Points for various available Chick-fil-A rewards (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Rewards</span>&rdquo;), you must access the Rewards section on the App or online at <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/AddRewards">www.chick-fil-a.com/MyProfile/AddRewards</a> to view Rewards available for redemption and select to redeem an available Reward.  A list of Rewards that may be available for redemption as part of the Program are available at the <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/one">Chick-fil-A One&trade; Program page</a>. You must have at least enough unredeemed and unexpired Points in your Chick-fil-A One account (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Available Points</span>&rdquo;) for the Reward you wish to redeem. Members must accrue a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) Available Points before the first redemption for any Reward. In any single transaction, only one Chick-fil-A One account may be used to redeem Points for Rewards. Points accrued by a Member in any purchase or transaction may only be redeemed for Rewards in a separate, subsequent purchase or transaction. Rewards provided to Members with Member Tier status have set terms and will expire in accordance with the terms stated for that Reward. Determinations regarding redemption of Points are subject to Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s discretion.</p>
<p>Points will be subtracted from the Member's Chick-fil-A One account immediately when a Reward is requested based on the total Points for the requested Reward. Points will be restored to a Member's Chick-fil-A One account only in the event Chick-fil-A determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Reward requested by that Member is unavailable or cannot be delivered.  Chick-fil-A reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards and limit the number of Rewards available at any particular Member Tier status.</p>
<p><strong>Special Member Benefits.</strong>  Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants, in their sole and absolute discretion, may periodically offer the opportunity for additional Member Benefits on particular transactions or special offers (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Member Benefits</span>&rdquo;). Member Benefits may be distributed via the App, online or via e-mail or mail from time to time (based on the information you have in your Chick-fil-A One account). Member Benefits may include periodic promotional offers on food, beverages and merchandise, invitations to special events, or related benefits. You must have your App set to receive notifications and/or have opted-in to receive email communications in order to receive promotional and marketing offers in App or via e-mail. Member Benefits may be customized based on your qualifying purchases and preferences. In certain events, Member Benefits may require that you have location settings enabled for them to be distributed to your App. Please note that Chick-fil-A and participating Chick-fil-A restaurants may be unable to send these Member Benefits to you if you have turned off your notifications or location settings in the App; if you have elected not to receive email communications from Chick-fil-A; or if you have poor network connectivity. Member Benefits may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Member Benefits are personal to you and cannot be shared, copied or transferred. You may be required to present your Chick-fil-A One account information at the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant in order to redeem Member Benefits. Read each offer carefully for specific details, limitations and restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Guest Offers.</strong>  Individuals that have a Chick-fil-A One account, but do not enroll in the Program as a Member may receive offers on a periodic basis. They are referred to as &lsquo;treats&rsquo; and &lsquo;rewards&rsquo; but may appear with different descriptions from time to time (&ldquo;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guest Offers</span>&rdquo;). In order to receive Guest Offers, eligible individuals must access their valid Chick-fil-A One account via  [www.chick-fil-a.com/one] or via the App to obtain the QR Code for the Guest Offer.  The number, type and frequency of Guest Offers are based on a number of factors, each of which is subject to change, without notice. Guest Offers are purely promotional offers, have no cash value and do not constitute property of the recipient. Guest Offers may have certain restrictions including expiration dates and short, time-limited redemption periods. Restrictions apply and items are subject to availability at participating Chick-fil-A restaurants. All Guest Offers must be redeemed prior to the stated expiration date to be valid. It is your responsibility to check your Chick-fil-A One account periodically for Guest Offers and use the Offers prior to the stated expiration date. To redeem a Guest Offer, you must present the valid Guest Offer at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant (for in-person transactions) or be logged into your Chick-fil-A One account (for in App transactions). Determinations regarding redemption of Guest Offers are subject to the discretion of the participating Chick-fil-A restaurant. Updates to the status of Guest Offers may take 24-48 hours or more to show up in your Chick-fil-A One account. A list of current Guest Offers and redeemed and expired Guest Offers are available under your Chick-fil-A One account.</p>
<p><strong>Expiration of Points and Rewards; Inactive Accounts.</strong>  Unredeemed Points expire upon the termination of your Chick-fil-A One account as described below. When you redeem your Points for Rewards, your oldest Available Points are used first. If you have any questions as to when your Points will expire, please contact Chick-fil-A by calling Chick-fil-A CARES (1-866-232-2040). Rewards and Member Benefits expire in connection with the terms provided with that Reward or Member Benefit.  Once Points expire or are used to redeem a Reward, the Points will be removed from a Member&rsquo;s account.  Points will not be added back to a Member&rsquo;s account if the Member does not use a Reward before it expires.</p>
<p>CFA reserves the right to cancel a Member&rsquo;s Program registration and Chick-fil-A One account if the Member&rsquo;s account remains inactive for a period of two (2) years or more. Accordingly, once you register for the Program, if you do not make a purchase or engage in an activity for which you will receive Points within your Member account within two (2) years after your initial registration or the last recorded purchase or activity for which you received Points, Chick-fil-A reserves the right to cancel your account.  You understand and agree that cancellation by Chick-fil-A of a Chick-fil-A One account or Program membership will result in the cancellation of all Points, Rewards, Member Benefits, and any progress towards a Member Tier associated with that account and the inability to earn and/or redeem further Points, Rewards, and Member Benefits, regardless of Member Tier.</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation; Termination.</strong> You may opt-out of the Program at any time, for any reason by cancelling your Chick-fil-A One account by calling Chick-fil-A CARES (1-866-232-2040). If you cancel your Chick-fil-A One account, any unredeemed Points, Rewards and Member Benefits, and/or progress towards a Member Tier will automatically be cancelled and will no longer be available for redemption. If you re-enroll at any time, you will start at the introductory Member Tier level as applicable. Chick-fil-A reserves the right to suspend or terminate, at Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s sole and absolute discretion, any Chick-fil-A One account if Chick-fil-A believes that the account holder has abused Chick-fil-A One privileges, has violated or acted inconsistently with these Terms or applicable law or acted in a manner harmful to our interests.</p>
<p>Upon cancellation or termination for any reason, your Chick-fil-A One account shall immediately cease and you may no longer receive Points, Rewards, or Member Benefits. Chick-fil-A has no obligation to refund you for any unredeemed Points, Rewards, Member Benefits, or other benefits of the Program following cancellation. Because we plan our communications in advance, it may take several weeks for your request to become effective. If you continue to receive our communications after expressing an opt-out preference, please let us know so that we can investigate the situation.</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A reserves the right to change, modify or terminate the Program, or any or all benefits under the Program or any policy pertaining to the Program, at any time, for any reason, including our right to discontinue or change the Member Tiers or change the expiration date or redemption value of Points or Rewards, merge the Program with another program or to adjust how Points or Rewards are received, calculated or redeemed.</p>
<p>If Chick-fil-A elects to terminate or modify in a material way the Program or any benefits or policies, Chick-fil-A will provide a notice of the material modification or termination by posting the modifications or notice of termination on the <a href="https://www.chick-fil-a.com/one">Chick-fil-A One&trade; Program page</a>  and update the Last Updated date.  We may also attempt to notify you in other ways. Any modifications will become effective immediately after such posting or other such notification. We encourage you to review these Terms regularly for modifications.  In the event of such termination, at Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s election, Chick-fil-A may allow you to redeem any outstanding valid and unexpired Points and Rewards at a participating Chick-fil-A restaurant until expiration of such Points or Rewards. ANY UNREDEEMED AND UNEXPIRED POINTS OR REWARDS SHALL BE CANCELLED AT THE LATER OF (1) THE EXPIRATION OF THE THEN-CURRENT REWARDS OR (2) NINETY (90) DAYS AFTER PROGRAM TERMINATION.</p>
<p><strong>General Restrictions.</strong> Chick-fil-A shall be the sole arbiter in cases of suspected abuse, fraud, or violation of its Terms and any decision it makes relating to termination or disabling of Program (including, but not limited to, cancellation of Points, Rewards, Member Perks and Guest Offers) shall be final and binding. Should you object to any of these Terms, or any subsequent modifications thereto, or become dissatisfied with the Program, your sole remedy is to discontinue participation in Program and properly cancel your account in the manner provided above.</p>

            <h3>The Chick-fil-A Franchise System</h3>
<h4>Franchise Legal Notices</h4>
<p>The information contained in this website is not intended as an offer to sell, or the solicitation of an offer to buy, a franchise. It is for information purposes only. As explained below, any offer to sell a franchise by Chick-fil-A, Inc. (&ldquo;Chick-fil-A&rdquo;) will be made only after individuals have completed a Chick-fil-A Operator application and qualified to receive a Franchise Disclosure Document. Other qualifications will apply in determining whether you will be offered a Chick-fil-A franchise.</p>
<p>
Through this website, you can submit to Chick-fil-A an Expression of Interest form for a Chick-fil-A franchise opportunity. If you submit an Expression of Interest form, Chick-fil-A will not be obligated to offer you a franchise opportunity. Rather, Chick-fil-A will review and evaluate the information you submit in your Expression of Interest to determine if you meet Chick-fil-A&rsquo;s preliminary criteria for Operator candidate consideration. If we decide that you meet our preliminary criteria for Operator candidate consideration, you may be given the opportunity to fill out a Chick-fil-A Operator Application. If you are invited to fill out an Operator Application, Chick-fil-A will send you an invitation electronically, which will include information that will allow you to access and submit the Operator Application on-line. Upon receipt of a completed Operator Application, Chick-fil-A reviews the applicant&rsquo;s candidacy further and determines what next steps are appropriate (i.e., continuation of the selection process or discontinuation of consideration). For those individuals who qualify, an offer to sell a franchise will only be made in conjunction with the delivery of a Chick-fil-A Franchise Disclosure Document.</p>
<p>
There are approximately 22 countries and 15 U.S. states that regulate the offer and sale of franchises. These countries are Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada (provinces of Alberta, <span>British Columbia, Manitoba,&nbsp;</span>New Brunswick, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island), China, France, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Romania, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Tunisia, the United States of America, and Vietnam. The U.S. states are California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. If you are a resident of one of these states or countries, are receiving this message in one of these states or countries, or intend to operate a franchise in any of these states or countries, we will not offer you a franchise unless and until we have complied with any applicable pre-sale registration and/or disclosure requirements in the applicable jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>California Supply Chains Act</h3>
<p>California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 Disclosure</p>
<p>Chick-fil-A, Inc. (&ldquo;CFA&rdquo;) is committed to legal compliance and ethical conduct for itself and expects the same of its vendors. Thus, CFA&rsquo;s policy is to only do business with vendors who have certified to CFA that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA&rsquo;s Vendor Code of Conduct, and CFA expects its vendors to take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. Specifically, CFA will not conduct business with vendors employing persons under the age of 14, or in/under prison, indentured or bonded labor, or slave labor; benefitting from human trafficking; using corporal punishment or other forms of mental and physical coercion as a form of discipline; or providing or supplying goods or services tainted by any of the foregoing practices.</p>
<p>
In accordance with the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010, CFA makes the following disclosures:</p>
<p>
CFA requires its vendors to certify that their business practices are lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA&rsquo;s Vendor Code of Conduct (including those provisions relating to human trafficking and slavery), and that they take steps to ensure the same of their own supply chains. To ensure accountability, CFA reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with any vendor who fails to provide such certifications or whose business practices, or the business practices of its own suppliers and subcontractors, are not lawful, ethical and in compliance with the principles set forth in CFA&rsquo;s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA also reserves the right to terminate its business relationship with vendors who fail to provide written confirmation to CFA that they have a program in place to monitor their suppliers and subcontractors for compliance with law, good ethics, and the principles set forth in CFA&rsquo;s Vendor Code of Conduct. CFA reserves the right to conduct verification and audits (including third-party verification and audits) of its suppliers regarding human trafficking and slavery. CFA has conducted general audits of certain of its suppliers, and has not observed violations with respect to human trafficking or slavery issues. CFA is currently considering whether and how to best use third-party supply chain verification and independent unannounced audits with its suppliers. CFA provides company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management with training on CFA&rsquo;s business practices, vendor requirements, and CFA&rsquo;s Vendor Code of Conduct, including those provisions relating to mitigating risks of human trafficking and slavery. Employees and management failing to meet CFA standards regarding slavery and trafficking are subject to disciplinary action.</p>

<br />
<strong>2.<span> </span>How to Enter:&nbsp;</strong> Arrive at the Restaurant at the Entry Period Start Time or up to thirty (30) minutes prior to the Entry Period Start Time and comply with any additional entry instructions provided by Sponsor&rsquo;s representatives at the Restaurant, which shall be consistent with these Official Rules and the information provided at the Giveaway Website.

Each eligible individual who completes and signs the Release and Waiver will become an Alternate, numbered 1-10 based on the order drawn, in the Giveaway (<strong>&ldquo;Alternate&rdquo;</strong>). <strong>Limit one (1) Ticket per eligible individual. Tickets must be submitted by the individual. Submission of multiple Tickets by or on behalf of the same individual will result in ineligibility with respect to all entries submitted by or for that individual.</strong> Tickets and/or Numbers may not be sold, traded, transferred, assigned or auctioned. Sponsor reserves the right to verify the eligibility of Participants and Alternates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Participants and Alternates must provide all required information and consents on the Release and Waiver, including without limitation first and last name, to be eligible to participate in the Giveaway.

Only individuals meeting all eligibility requirements set forth in these Official Rules may participate in the Giveaway or win a Prize.<br />
<br />
If there are 100 or fewer individuals present at the Entry Period Start Time who are eligible and prepared to participate in the Giveaway, Sponsor will check ID to confirm eligibility, and each eligible individual who completes and signs the Release and Waiver will become a Participant in the Giveaway. If there are fewer than 100 individuals present at the Entry Period Start Time, Sponsor shall award all Numbers on a first-come, first-served basis until all 100 Participants are selected or until the end of the Entry Period. If possible, all Numbers will be awarded until 100 Participants and 10 Alternates are selected. No additional Participants or Alternates will be permitted to enter and participate in the Giveaway after the conclusion of the Entry Period.&nbsp;<br />
