to share your Contact Data with any third parties, please email us at <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="fc9d98919592bc9b8995889d8e888e959f978fd29f9391">[email&#160;protected]</a>, or select the “opt out”

</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>10. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. Customer’s personal payment information (e.g., credit card information)
is currently stored with a third-party payment processing company, Braintree or PayPal. We do not store credit card information
on our own service, only on the third-party server “vault.” Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will
keep your other personal information private on secure servers and will not share it with third parties, unless such
disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property;
or (c) enforce our Terms of Service. We provide you with the capability to transmit your Personal Data Information via
secured and encrypted channels if you use a similarly equipped web browser. </p>

systems and processes relating to Company’s proper handling of Personal Data Information, and to make sure that
appropriate safeguards be in place to ensure that any processing and retention of Personal Data complies with the GDPR
and Privacy Shield requirements. Moreover, the DPO shall be responsible for the record-keeping relating to all
processing activities, for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with GNPR and Privacy Shield, should a compliance
audit be requested.  </p>

</ol>
<ol>
<li>
<p>12. PROCESS TO ACCESS, UPDATE, CORRECT, OR ERASE PERSONAL INFORMATION. We maintain a procedure in order to help you confirm

Through your personal profile you may: (a) review and update your Personal Information that we have already collected;
(b) choose whether or not you wish us to send you information about our company, or promotional material from some of
our partners; and/or (c) choose whether or not you wish for us to share your Personal Information with third parties.
