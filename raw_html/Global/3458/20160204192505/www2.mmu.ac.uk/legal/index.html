<h2 id="terms">Terms and Conditions Applicable to the provision of the University's Educational Services</h2>
<!--
	<p>The provision of educational services by the Manchester Metropolitan University is subject to terms and conditions
	  of contract and, before accepting an offer of a place at the University, you are asked to note the following:</p>

	<p>Whilst the University has made every effort to ensure that the information contained in this online prospectus is
	  accurate and up-to-date, we cannot give any warranty that this is the case or guarantee that places will be
	  available for any particular courses.  The University shall not be responsible for any loss or damage howsoever
	  arising from your use of this online prospectus (except in the case of death or personal injury arising from our
	  negligence).</p>

	<p>All information on courses within this online prospectus relates to entry during the academic year to which this
	  online prospectus relates (and which is indicated on the front of the prospectus) and will not be applicable to
	  entry in any other academic year.</p>

	<p>The availability of courses offered may be subject to a minimum level of interest being shown by applicants in any
	  given year.</p>

	<p>The University will use all reasonable endeavours to deliver educational services which it considers appropriate
	  (for example library, IT and learning support) in accordance with the descriptions set out in this online prospectus
	  or any other promotional material.  However, the University reserves the right, if it reasonably considers it
	  necessary:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>To make reasonable variations to the content of the courses;</li>
		<li>To make reasonable variations to the methods of delivery of courses (including but not limited to variations
		  to numbers of lectures, tutorials, assessment procedures and timetables);</li>
		<li>To suspend, discontinue or cancel courses (for example in the event of staff shortages, reductions in public
		  funding, third party industrial action or for other reasons beyond the control of the University); and</li>
		<li>To make reasonable variations to services available to students (for example library opening hours).</li>
	</ol>

	<p>In the event that the University cancels a course before it begins, it will make every effort to inform all relevant
	  applicants at the earliest available opportunity. In such circumstances relevant applicants will receive a full
	  refund of any tuition fees paid.</p>

	<p>In the event that the University varies a course before it begins, it will make every effort to inform all relevant
	  applicants at the earliest available opportunity. Such applicants may withdraw from the course without penalty by
	  notifying the University in writing of their intention to withdraw within 1 month of being informed of the variation.
	  In such circumstances they will receive a full refund of any tuition fees paid.</p>

	<p>In the event that the University is forced to cancel a course after it has begun, the University will use reasonable
	  endeavours to provide a suitable alternative course and will take all reasonable steps to minimise any disruption
	  which might result.</p>

	<p>Every student of the University is required to register in a form prescribed by the University at or before the
	  commencement of each year or other defined stage of their course, and, at the time of registration, to sign an
	  undertaking to abide by its regulations, rules and codes of conduct. Copies of the above, collectively referred to a
	  Student Regulations and Procedures, will be available for inspection at the time of registration and a copy of them,
	  usually in the form of a Students' Handbook, will be given to you for you to retain. However, should you wish to
	  inspect a copy of the Student Regulations and Procedures now, please apply to the Academic Registrar, the Manchester
	  Metropolitan University, All Saints, Manchester M15 6BH, who will be pleased to arrange this for you.</p>

	<p>The University holds personal data on all applicants and enrolled students. All such data is kept in accordance with
	  the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998.</p>
      -->
<p>The provision of educational services by the Manchester Metropolitan University is subject to terms and conditions of contract and, before accepting an offer of a place at the University, you are asked to note the following:</p>
<h3>1. What is the contract between you and the University?</h3>
<p>At its heart, it is a contract under which the University agree to provide educational services and the facilities for you to study, and you agree to progress those studies at the University.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. What makes up the contract?</h3>
<p>The contract between you and the University is formed when you accept our offer of a place. The contract is made up of a number of key documents (&ldquo;Key Contract Documents&rdquo;).&nbsp; These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>This document (Terms and Conditions applicable to the provision of the University&rsquo;s Educational Services)</li>
<li>MMU&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/docs/policies_regulations.pdf">Regulations, Policies and Procedures for Students 2015/16</a></li>
<li>Key Information on your course (you will get this from your Course Brochure and the Prospectus)</li>
<li>Your offer letter and any other document referred to within.</li>
</ol>
<h3>3. What does the University expect of you?</h3>
<p>The University expects you to play a full and active role in progressing your studies at the University. Alongside the obligations in these Terms and Conditions applicable to the provision of the University's Educational Services, the University has developed the <a href="/commitment/">MMU Commitment</a>.&nbsp; The Commitment sets out the intention of the University and the Students&rsquo; Union to work in partnership with you as an MMU student in supporting your learning and helping you succeed, and sets out your own role in ensuring that success, and the standards of behaviour and personal responsibility expected of our students.&nbsp;Although the University would like to draw your attention to the Commitment, it is not intended to be legally binding or to form part of the Key Contract Documents.</p>
<h3>4. Payment of fees</h3>
<p>You will find extensive guidance for students on a wide range of issues relating to the payment of fees in the University&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.finance.mmu.ac.uk/uploads/36/1516%20UG%20and%20Other%20Non%20PG%20Students%20Regulations%20for%20the%20Payment%20of%20Uni%20Fees.pdf">Regulations for the Payment of Fees and the associated Key Facts</a> document. Please note that, ultimately, you may not be able to continue with your studies should you fail to pay your tuition fees.</p>
<h3>5.&nbsp;The University&rsquo;s Regulations</h3>
<p>By enrolling at the University you agree to comply with the all the provisions of the <a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/docs/policies_regulations.pdf">University&rsquo;s Regulations, Rules, Codes, Policies and Procedures</a>.</p>
<p>There are some provisions we need to draw your particular attention to as they can result in a disciplinary process and ultimately mean you may not be able to continue at the University. These include:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li style="list-style-type: a;"><a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/assessment/docs/academic-misconduct.pdf">Procedure for Handling Academic Misconduct</a></li>
<li style="list-style-type: a;"><a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/assessment/docs/withdrawal-suspension.pdf">Procedure for Students at Risk of Academic Failure</a></li>
<li style="list-style-type: a;"><a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/assessment/docs/code-of-conduct.pdf">Student Code of Conduct</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>6.&nbsp;Professional Suitability</h3>
<p>Some programmes of study will require you to register with a statutory professional body and/or to practice under licence. It is your responsibility to ensure that all necessary declarations (including but not limited to criminal records, medical conditions, disabilities) are made to the University during the admissions process and during the period of study,&nbsp; and that you comply with all relevant rules and regulations during study (and placement, if appropriate). The University will use its reasonable endeavours to support students in attaining fitness to practice but accepts no responsibility in the event that a student is declared not fit for practice.</p>
<h3>7.&nbsp;Changes to Course Provision (and other changes)</h3>
<p>The University will use all reasonable endeavours to deliver your course in accordance with the description applied to it in the course brochure and prospectus for the academic year in which you begin your course. However, the University is entitled to make reasonable changes to ensure the University delivers the best quality of educational experience to you.</p>
<p>These changes include:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Keeping our course content and delivery up to date and relevant.</li>
<li>Meeting the requirements of an external accrediting or reviewing body</li>
<li>Reviewing and refreshing optional modules</li>
<li>Altering the location of the course within your designated campus</li>
<li>Altering the method or delivery of the course</li>
</ol>
<p>In making any such changes, the University will aim to keep the changes to the minimum necessary to achieve the required quality of experience and will usually notify and consult with affected students in advance about any changes that are required.</p>
<p>Sometimes circumstances may arise which are beyond the control of the University. Examples (without limitation) of such circumstances include:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>industrial action by University staff or third parties</li>
<li>the unanticipated departure of key members of University staff</li>
<li>acts of terrorism</li>
<li>damage or interruption to buildings, facilities or equipment</li>
<li>severe weather conditions</li>
<li>the acts of any governmental or local authority; or</li>
<li>where the numbers recruited to a course are so low that it is not possible to deliver an appropriate quality of education for students enrolled on it.</li>
</ol>
<p>In these circumstances, the University will provide as much notice as possible and will take all reasonable steps to minimise the resultant disruption by, for example, delivering a modified version of the course, or offering affected students the chance to move to another course or institution. To the full extent it is possible under the general law the University excludes liability for any loss and/or damage suffered by any applicant or student as a result of those circumstances.</p>
<p>If the University changes your course in a fundamental way and you are not satisfied with the changes, you will be offered the opportunity to withdraw from the programme and, if required, reasonable support to transfer to another provider. It should be noted that this is without prejudice to your right of cancellation and to any other remedy which the student would be entitled by law to seek.</p>
<h3>8.&nbsp;Complaints</h3>
<p>MMU recognises there may be occasions where students wish to raise legitimate complaints relating to their course, or the facilities and services provided by the University. It is important to both students and staff to know that such complaints will be dealt with seriously and transparently, and without fear of recrimination. To ensure that this happens, the University has in place a <a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/academic/casqe/regulations/assessment/docs/complaints.pdf">Student Complaints Procedure</a> which details procedures and parameters for making a complaint, alongside what action may be taken in response to complaints.</p>
<p>If having exhausted all stages of the University&rsquo;s internal complaints procedure, a student considers that the University has failed to consider and respond to their complaint appropriately, the student can refer their complaint to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education, which provides an independent scheme for the review of student complaints.</p>
<h3>9.Data Protection</h3>
<p>MMU is registered as a data controller with the Office of the Information Commissioner. The University&rsquo;s entry on the Register of Data Controllers can be found at <a href="https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/DoSearch?reg=412923">https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/DoSearch?reg=412923</a>. MMU will hold and process your personal data including some sensitive personal data. As an MMU Student you agree to this data being processed in accordance with our <a href="http://www.mmu.ac.uk/policy/policy.php?id=100">Data Protection Policy</a>. If you have any queries relating to access to or storage of data, please review the Data Protection Policy which will provide guidance as to how to address any queries you may have.</p>
<p>Examination pass lists and/or degree classifications may be published. If you do not wish your results to be published in this way, you must notify the Director of Registry Services stating your reasons in writing by no later than seven days before you complete your examination or assessment. Your reasons will be considered and, where it is felt that publication of your results is likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress and that this would be unwarranted, publication will be withheld.</p>
<p>You are obliged to provide the University with up to date contact details. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h3>10.&nbsp;Students who are under 18 on entry</h3>
<p>Higher education is an adult environment and courses may not always be suitable for those who are under 18, who are legally defined as children. Students are therefore normally expected to be 18 years of age by 1 September of the year in which they enrol.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The University therefore reserves the right not to enrol anyone who has not met this age criterion; each case will be considered individually. The University is committed to the safety and well-being of all its Students but has particular responsibilities in relation to those who are under 18 when they arrive. The University will decide whether to offer residential accommodation to Students under 18 on a case by case basis. Our unfiltered access to the internet and some materials in the library are unsuitable for Students under 18.</p>
<p>When the University makes an offer to any applicant who will be under 18 on entry it will also provide further guidance to the applicant and his or her parents or guardian, together with a consent form for their parent or guardian to complete. The provision of consent and agreement to the University&rsquo;s terms for under 18s are conditions of enrolment.</p>
<h3>11.&nbsp;Other services</h3>
<p>Other, non-educational services provided by the University to you, for example residential accommodation and sports centre membership, amount to separate and distinct contracts and are therefore subject&nbsp; to separate contractual terms.</p>
<h3>12. Employers&rsquo; Liability Insurance</h3>
<p>A copy of the University&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="/media/mmuacuk/content/documents/legal/employers-liability-insurance-certificate.pdf">Certificate of Employers' Liability Insurance</a>&nbsp;(valid from 1st August 2015) is available.</p>
<h3>13. Law</h3>
<p>This contract shall be governed by English law.</p>
