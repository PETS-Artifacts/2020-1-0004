This is the case where: You do not think that the Personal Data We hold about You is accurate; Your Personal Data is being processed unlawfully, but You do not want Your Personal Data to be erased; it is no longer necessary for Us to hold Your Personal Data for the purposes of our processing, but You still require that Personal Data in relation to a legal claim; and You have objected to processing, and are waiting for that objection to be verified. Where processing has been restricted for one of these reasons, We may continue to store Your Personal Data. However, We will only process it for other reasons: with Your consent; in relation to a legal claim; for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person; or for reasons of important public interest. </li><li>The right to object to processing;<br/><br/>You can object to Us processing Your Personal Data on grounds relating to Your particular situation, but only as far as our legal basis for the processing is that it is necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of any official authority vested in Us; or the purposes of our legitimate interests or those of a third party. If You make an objection, We will stop processing Your Personal Data unless We are able to: demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing, and that these legitimate grounds override Your interests, rights and freedoms; or the processing is in relation to a legal claim. </li><li>The right to data portability;<br/><br/>You have the right to request that Your Personal Data be moved, copied or transferred from one database, storage or IT environment to another. </li><li>The right to complain to a supervisory authority;<br/><br/>If You think that our processing of Your Personal Data infringes data protection laws, You can lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do this in the EU member state of Your habitual residence, Your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. </li><li>The right to withdraw consent; and<br/><br/>To the extent that the legal basis We are relying on for processing Your Personal Data is consent, You are entitled to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. </li><li>The right to object to direct marketing<br/><br/>You can choose whether We process Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes. If You do not want Us to process Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes, We will not process Your Personal Data for this purpose. You can exercise Your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms We use to collect Your Personal Data in <a href="https://admin.names.co.uk/">Your Online Control Panel</a>.</li></ul><p>If You wish to:</p><ul><li>Request access to, deletion of or correction of, Your Personal Data.
