                <p>Although we have implemented systems and procedures to secure the data maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions can never be assured. Shimano employees are made aware of our privacy practices through periodic communications and training. Our policy is to limit access to Personal Information to those Shimano employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve the information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Please note, however, that any Personal Information you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone. WHILE SHIMANO HAS TAKEN COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO SAFEGUARD PERSONAL INFORMATION, SHIMANO CANNOT AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE COMPLETE SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION BECAUSE COMPLETE SECURITY DOES NOT PRESENTLY EXIST ON THE INTERNET.</p>

            <div class="l3Container_textBox mbt_textBox_contact h4_list">
              <p>
                We maintain state of the industry security measures to avoid unauthorized access to, alteration, disclosure or loss of your personal data. For example, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt important information, such as your credit card data, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access during transmission of your orders over the Internet. We implement standard industry practices internally and with our service providers to maintain the security of your personal data depending on its sensitivity and to avoid disclosure of such personal data unpermitted under this privacy policy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although we have implemented systems and procedures to secure the data maintained by us, security during Internet transmissions can never be assured. Shimano employees are made aware of our privacy practices through periodic communications and training. Our policy is to limit access to personal data to those Shimano employees or agents with a specific need to access or retrieve the information. We store data on multiple service systems, in controlled environments. To maintain security, we conduct internal reviews of our security measures on a regular basis. Please note, however, that any personal data you post in chat rooms or message boards is available to anyone. While we have taken commercially reasonable precautions to safeguard personal data, we cannot and do not guarantee complete security of personal data because complete security does not presently exist on the Internet.

                Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. We also recommend not to re-use passwords on other websites.

                We may transfer your personal data collected through the Sites to, and store at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). For example, Shimano staff working outside the EEA may access and further process your personal data. Such staff may be engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. Shimano will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable data protection laws, including the GDPR. For example, Shimano may use contracts approved by the European Commission for the transfer of data to such destinations.
