<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Types of Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We collect two basic types of information &ndash; personal information and anonymous information &ndash; and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information. <strong>Personal Information</strong>&nbsp; means information that identifies (whether directly or indirectly) a particular individual, such as the individual&rsquo;s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address and/or telephone number. <strong>Anonymous Information</strong> means information that does not directly or indirectly identify, and cannot reasonably be used to identify, an individual (including an individual&rsquo;s computing device). <strong>Aggregate Information</strong> means information about groups or categories of individuals which does not identify and cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual. We may share Aggregate and Anonymous Information with other parties without restriction.</p>
<p>We collect the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration information you provide when you create an account, which may include your first name and surname, country of residence, gender, date of birth, e-mail address, username and password.</li>
<li>Transaction information you provide when you request information or purchase a product or service from us, whether on our sites or through our applications, including your postal address, telephone number and payment information. If you conduct transactions (for instance, on Second Life&rsquo;s LindeX), we may collect and retain some or all of the information related to these transactions, including transaction amount(s), parties involved, time and manner of exchange, and other transaction circumstances.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Information you provide in public forums on our Service.

If you provide Personal Information when you use any of these features, that Personal Information may be publicly posted and otherwise disclosed without limitation as to its use by us or by a third party. We have no obligation to keep private personally identifiable information that you have made available to other users or the public using these functions. To request removal of your Personal Information from a public forum on one of our sites or applications, please contact <a href="mailto:privacy@lindenlab.com">Customer Support</a>.</li>
<li>Information sent either one-to-one or within a limited group using our message, chat, post or similar functionality, where we are permitted by law to collect this information.</li>

<li><strong>Former Customer:</strong> If you discontinue your use of our Service, we may keep your registration file in our database for use in the event that you elect to renew your use of our Service, as well as for anti-fraud and other such protective measures.&nbsp;</li>

The information we collect is covered by this Privacy Policy and the information that the third-party site or platform collects is subject to the third-party site or platform&rsquo;s privacy practices.

<p>We recognize the need to provide further privacy protections with respect to Personal Information that we may collect from children on our sites and applications. Some of the features on our sites and applications are not directed towards children, and we do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children in connection with those features. When we direct certain sites, products or services toward children and intend to collect Personal Information from children, we take additional steps to protect their privacy, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notifying parents (including guardians) about our information practices with regard to children, including the types of Personal Information we may collect from children, the uses to which we may put that information, and whether and with whom we may share that information;</li>
<li>In accordance with applicable law, obtaining parental consent for the collection, disclosure or use of Personal Information from their children, or for sending information about our products and services directly to their children;</li>
<li>Limiting our collection of Personal Information from children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity; and</li>
<li>Giving parents access or the ability to request access to Personal Information we have collected from their children and the ability to request that such Personal Information be changed or deleted. At any time a parent may request that we cease to collect further Personal Information from their child or request that any Personal Information that we have collected be changed or deleted from our records, in accordance with applicable law, by sending an e-mail to our <a href="mailto:privacy@lindenlab.com">Customer Support</a> team.</li>
</ul>
<p>In some instances, certain portions of our Service may allow children to submit Personal Information (such as their name and/or the child&rsquo;s or his or her parent&rsquo;s e-mail address) without first obtaining their parent&rsquo;s consent. For example, we may collect online contact information from a child for the purpose of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtaining parental consent and/or providing the child&rsquo;s parent with any information regarding their child&rsquo;s use of our Service, as required by law;</li>
<li>Responding directly to a specific request from the child on a one-time basis (for instance, in response to a customer support inquiry);</li>
<li>Responding directly more than once to a specific request from the child (for instance, to receive a newsletter or in-game communication from us), provided that in such case (i) we will use reasonable efforts to notify the child&rsquo;s parent (e.g. via e-mail) of such ongoing communications with the child promptly after our initial response to the child and before making any subsequent responses to the child, and (ii) the child&rsquo;s parent shall have the right to refuse further contact with the child and require the deletion of Personal Information about or collected from the child by contacting our Customer Support team;</li>
<li>Protecting the safety of a child participant on our Service, provided that we have used reasonable efforts to provide notice to the child&rsquo;s parent (e.g. via e-mail). If the parent fails to respond to such notice, we may use such online contact information for the purpose stated therein; and</li>
<li>Protecting the security or integrity of our Service, to take precautions against liability, to respond to judicial process or to the extent permitted under other provisions of applicable laws, to provide information to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation on a matter related to public safety, to the extent reasonably necessary to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parents are encouraged to spend time online with their children and to become familiar with the types of content available through our Service and on the Internet in general. Parents should regularly oversee their child&rsquo;s use of e-mail and other online communications and transactional features. Control tools are available from online services and software manufacturers that can help to provide a safe online environment for children. If your child has used your credit card in connection with our Service without your permission, please contact our <a href="mailto:privacy@lindenlab.com">Customer Support</a> team immediately.&nbsp;</p>
