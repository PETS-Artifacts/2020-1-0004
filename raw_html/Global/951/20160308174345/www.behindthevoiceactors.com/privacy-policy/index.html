					<div style="margin-left: 15px;">

					(iii) You must protect against unauthorized access to your username and password, and to your computer. Please sign off when finished using a shared computer. Your emails to us are not necessarily secure against interception so do not include sensitive information in them.

YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.<br />
					(iv) Please note that BTVA is not responsible for the information you volunteer about yourself in the discussions in our forums, comments, or other publicly accessible interaction, or information that you choose to make public in your member profile or other areas that allow users to upload or post content.
