      <p id="index_3">
        <strong>(b) Information Collected and Stored As You Access and Use the Site</strong>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us via our Site, we and our
      third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) store or collect certain
      information whenever you visit or interact with the Site (“

      <p>We may use various methods and technologies to store or collect Usage Information (“
      <strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”). Tracking Technologies may set, change, alter or modify settings or configurations
      on your Device. A few of the Tracking Technologies include, without limitation, the following (and subsequent technology and
      methods later developed):</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Cookies</em>
      </strong> . A cookie is a data file placed on a Device when it is used to visit the Site. A Flash cookie (or locally shared
      object) is a data file placed on a Device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built-in to or downloaded by you to your
      Device. HTML5 cookies can be programmed through HTML5 local storage. Unlike Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies do not require a
      plug-in. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial
      browsers, and in some but not all instances can be blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use
      will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options in this regard. Also, these
      tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, go to
      Adobe’s web site 
      <a href="http://www.adobe.com/">www.adobe.com</a>. Please be aware that if you disable or remove cookies, Flash cookies, or
      HTML5 cookies on your Device, some parts of our Site may not function properly, and that when you revisit our Site your
      ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Web Beacons</em>
      </strong> . Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1x1 GIFs” or “clear
      GIFs”) may be included in our Site’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or
      other web programming code inserted into a page or email can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be
      used for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate
      the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were
      actually viewed.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Embedded Scripts</em>
      </strong> . An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the
      Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third
      party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Browser Fingerprinting</em>
      </strong> . Collection and analysis of information from your Device, such as, without limitation, your operating system,
      plug-ins, system fonts and other data, for purposes of identification.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>ETag, or entity tag</em>
      </strong> . A feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of
      a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in
      this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer
      blocks HTTP, Flash, and/or HTML5 cookies.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Tracking Technologies Usage.</strong> We may use Tracking Technologies for a variety of purposes, including:</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Strictly Necessary</em>
      </strong> . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that we consider are strictly necessary to allow you to use and
      access our Site, including cookies required to prevent fraudulent activity, improve security or allow you to make use of
      shopping‑cart functionality.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Performance‑Related</em>
      </strong> . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are useful in order to assess the performance of the Site,
      including as part of our analytic practices or otherwise to improve the content, products or services offered through the
      Site.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Functionality‑Related</em>
      </strong> . We may use cookies or other Tracking Technologies that are required to offer you enhanced functionality when
      accessing the Site, including identifying you when you sign‑in to our Site or keeping track of our specified preferences,
      including in terms of the presentation of content on our Site.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>
        <em>Targeting‑Related</em>
      </strong> . We may use Tracking Technologies to deliver content, including ads, relevant to your interests on our Site and
      third‑party sites based on how you interact with our advertisements or content. This includes using Tracking Technologies
      to understand the usefulness to you of the advertisements and content that havebeen delivered to you. Further information on
      this, and your opt-out choices, is found in 
      <a href="#index_25">Section 6</a> below.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tracking Technologies Choices and Consent.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>We are giving you detailed notice of the Tracking Technologies and your limited choices regarding them so that your
      consent is meaningfully informed.</p>
      <p>
      <strong>Third Party Tracking and Do Not Track</strong> .</p>
      <p>There may be other Tracking Technologies now and later devised and used by us in connection with the Site. Further, third
      parties may use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Site, which may include the collection of information about your
      online activities over time and across third-party web sites or online services. We may not control those Tracking
      Technologies and we are not responsible for them. However, you consent to potentially encountering third party Tracking
      Technologies in connection with use of our Site and accept that our statements under this Privacy Policy do not apply to the
      Tracking Technologies or practices of such third parties.</p>
      <p>Various third parties are developing or have developed signals or other mechanisms for the expression of consumer choice
      regarding the collection of information about an individual consumer’s online activities over time and across third-party
      web sites or online services (e.g., browser do not track signals). Currently, we do not monitor or take any action with
      respect to these do not track signals or other mechanisms.</p>
      <p id="index_4">
        <strong>(c) Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong>
      </p>
      <p>We may receive information about you from your friends and others that use the Site, such as when they submit information
      to us on your behalf. Additionally, we may, from time to time, supplement the information we collect directly from you on our
      Site with outside records from third parties for various purposes, including to enhance our ability to serve you, to tailor
      our content to you and to offer you courses that may be of interest to you. To the extent we combine information we receive
      from those sources with your Personal Information we collect on the Site, it will be treated as Personal Information and we
      will apply this Privacy Policy to such combined information, unless we have disclosed otherwise. In no other circumstances do
      our statements under this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties, even if they have used
      our technology to collect it and share it with us.</p>
      <p id="index_5">
        <strong>(d)</strong>
        <strong>Interactions with Third-Party Services</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The Site may include functionality that allows certain kinds of interactions between the Site and a third-party web site
      or application. For example, we may provide third-party sites’ interfaces or links on the Site to facilitate sending a
      communication from the Site and we may use third parties to facilitate emails, tweets or Facebook postings. These third
      parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or other activities and these third parties’
      practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. St. Matthew&#39;s University may not control or have access to your
      communications through these third parties. Further, when you use third-party sites or services, you are using their services
      and not our services and they, not we, are responsible for their practices. You should review the applicable third-party
      privacy policies before using such third-party tools on our Site.</p>
      <p id="index_6">
        <strong>(e) Information You Provide About a Third Party</strong>
      </p>
      <p>You may send someone else a communication from the Site, such as sending an invitation to a friend. If so, the information
      you provide (names, email addresses, etc.) is used to facilitate the communication and is not used by us for any other
      marketing purpose unless we obtain consent from that person or we explicitly say otherwise. Please be aware that when you use
      any send-to-a-friend functionality on our Site, your contact information, name or user name and message may be included in
      the communication sent to your addressee(s). Some of these tools may be third-party tools subject to third-party privacy
      policies.</p>

      that you might be interested in; (b) prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times; and (c) understand the
      usefulness to you of the advertisements that have been delivered to you. You acknowledge and agree that associated technology
      may access and use your Device and may set or change settings on your Device in connection with the associated operations.
