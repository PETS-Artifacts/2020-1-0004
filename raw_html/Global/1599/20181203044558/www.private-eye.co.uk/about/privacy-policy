		<P><b>Marketing </b><P>
We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and advertising. 
<P><b>Promotional offers from us </b><P>
We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need, or what may be of interest to you. This is how we decide which products, services and offers may be relevant for you (we call this marketing). <P>
You will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or purchased services from us and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
<P><b>Third-party marketing </b><P>
We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data for marketing purposes. 
<P><b>Opting out</b><P>
You can ask us to stop sending you marketing communications at any time by contacting us at any time. <P>
Where you opt out of receiving these marketing communications, this will not apply to personal data provided to us as a result of service purchase, product/service experience or other transactions.
<P><b>Cookies</b><P>
You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when websites set or access cookies. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of this website may become inaccessible or not function properly. For more information about the cookies we use, please see <a href='about/cookie-policy'>our cookies policy</a>.

<P><b>Change of purpose </b><P>
We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please contact us. <P>
If we need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis which allows us to do so.<P>
Please note that we may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.
<P><b>International transfers</b><P>
We may need to share your personal data with external third parties from time to time. Some of our external third parties are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.<P>
Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:  <ul><li>
Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe.  
<br><li>Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US.</ul>
Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA. 
<P><b>Data security</b><P>
We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality. <P>
We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
<P><b>Data retention<P>
<P>How long will you use my personal data for?</b><P>
We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. <P>
To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
<P><b>Your legal rights</b><P>
Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You have the right to:<ul><li><b>
Request access to your personal data:</b> this enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it. This is commonly known as a "data subject access request".
<br><li><b>Request correction of your personal data: </b>this enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
<br><li><b>Request erasure of your personal data:</b> this enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You can also ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law.
<br><li><b>Object to processing of your personal data: </b>where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
<br><li><b>Request restriction of processing your personal data:</b> this enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy; (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it
<br><li><b>Request transfer of your personal data:</b> we will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. (Note: this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.)</ul>
<P>If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us. 
<P><b>What we may need from you </b><P>
We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response<P>
Where we are not able to determine with any degree of certainty whether the information requested by you relates exclusively to you, our disclosure of such information to you may pose a privacy risk to a third party (for example, where a cookie is associated with a device used by more than one person). We will assess each request to exercise any of the rights listed above individually on its merits and will disclose the requested information where we are satisfied that such disclosure does not represent a privacy risk to any third party.
<P><b>No fee usually required</b><P>
You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
<P><b>Time limit to respond</b><P>
We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.
