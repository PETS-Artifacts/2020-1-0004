This Privacy Policy governs our collection of information from you through your use of the Sites and Applications. It does not apply to any information you may provide to us through other means; for example, via postal mail or via telephone. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so that you understand our online privacy practices. By browsing a Site; installing, downloading or using an Application; and/or providing your personal information to us in any other way, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to us at <a href="mailto:feedback@politico.com" target="_blank">feedback@politico.com</a> or POLITICO LLC, 1100 Wilson Blvd., 6th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209. </p><p>For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means data that, by itself, allows someone to identify or contact you as an individual, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. “Anonymous data” means data that does not, by itself, permit the identification of individual persons and that is not associated with or linked to personal information.

                                        <h2>Types Of Information We Collect</h2><p>

                                    The information we gather falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by users; and (2) information automatically gathered.</p>

                                        <h3>Information You Provide To Us</h3><p>

                                     We collect and store personal information that you voluntarily supply either while on our Sites or Applications. </p><p>When you register as a POLITICO member, we collect personal information including your name, company, title, zip code, e-mail address, password, and information regarding tip sheets and author alerts you would like to receive. </p><p>When you request information about POLITICO PRO subscriptions, we collect personal information including your name, e-mail address, title, job type, phone number, organization name, organization type, country, industry field of interest, interested products, and locations of interest.</p><p>When you order a subscription to POLITICO or POLITICO PRO or pay your bill online, we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name, credit card, and other related information.</p><p>When you sign up for our electronic newsletters, we collect your e-mail address.</p><p>When you respond to our surveys, we will collect all the information requested in the surveys, including any applicable contact information and demographic information such as your email, first name, last name, location, place of employment, type of employment, industry, household income, race, age, and gender.</p><p>We also collect personal information at other points in our Sites and Application which state personal information is being collected.</p><p><i><b> </b></i><b></b></p><h3><b></b>Information Automatically Collected</h3><p><br />We also may collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through our Sites or Applications. </p><p>To make our Sites and Applications more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third-party service provider) may collect information from your computer or device, including but not limited to:</p><ul><li>The date and time of your visit and the web pages and content you view and links you click on while navigating within our Sites or Applications;</li><li>Information about the type of content accessed via our Sites or Applications;</li><li>The site you visited before and after visiting our Sites;</li><li>Your Internet Protocol (IP) address (a numerical address assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so that other computers connected to the Internet can communicate with you online) that can sometimes be used to derive your general geographic area;</li><li>Search terms you enter using our Sites or Applications;</li><li>Unique identifiers, including non-global mobile device identification numbers;</li><li>Information about your computer device such as your device type, screen size, browser type, language and other settings, memory capacity, plug-ins, Internet domain, TCP configuration parameters, operating system, carrier code, time zone and the names, versions and package IDs of software installed on your device; and</li><li>Information collected through cookies, pixel tags and other tracking technologies (see additional descriptions of these terms below).</li></ul><p>To help make the Sites and Applications more responsive to the needs of users, we employ a standard software feature, called a &quot;cookie,&quot; to assign each user a unique, random number that resides on a user's computer or device. The cookie by itself does not personally identify the user; it merely identifies the computer or device with which the user accesses a Site or Application. Cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of a Site or Application where you have entered preference information before. </p><p>When we post videos, third parties may use local shared objects, known as flash cookies to store your preferences for volume control or to personalize certain video features. Flash cookies are different from cookies because of the amount and type of data and how the data is stored. </p><p>We also may use web beacons (also known as &quot;pixel tags&quot;) to access cookies and to count users who visit our Sites, use our Applications, or open our HTML-formatted email messages. Pixel tags are tiny graphic images with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track online movements of our users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, pixel tags are embedded invisibly in web pages and e-mail messages. We may collect information about your interactions with our e-mail messages, such as the links you click on and whether you open or forward a message, the date and time of these interactions and the device you use to read our emails.</p><p>We use third-party analytics services (“Analytics Services”), to help analyze how users use our Sites and Applications. The information generated by the cookies or other technologies about your use of our Sites and/or Applications (the “Analytics Information”) is transmitted to the Analytics Services. The Analytics Services use Analytics Information to compile reports on user activity. The Analytics Services may also transfer the Analytics Information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process Analytics Information on their behalf. Each Analytics Service’s ability to use and share Analytics Information is restricted by such Analytics Service’s terms of use and privacy policy. By using a Site or Application, you consent to the processing of data about you by Analytics Services in the manner and for the purposes set out above. For a full list of our Analytics Services, please contact us at feedback@politico.com.</p><p>We also collect anonymized, cookie-based demographics data from third parties to analyze the composition of our audience.</p><p>Our Site also makes use of third-party cookie data collection and linking services, including Vision Critical, Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting and DoubleClick for Publishers. POLITICO and third-party vendors, including Google and Vision Critical, may use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on your past visits to our website and (ii) report how your ad impressions, uses of ad services, and interactions with the foregoing are related to your visits to the Site. In addition, we may use Google Analytics data, including but not limited to, geographic, demographics, and interest reporting information to recognize and understand user preferences, make improvements, and for other business purposes. To learn more about how Google uses data, visit <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>. To learn more about how Vision Critical uses data, visit <a href="https://www.visioncritical.com/trust/policies/" target="_blank">https://www.visioncritical.com/trust/policies/</a>. </p><p>We also may use third-party advertising companies to target and serve some of the advertisements that appear on our Sites and Applications, and these companies likewise may use their own cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect non-personally identifiable information from users of our Sites and Applications. The information collected by these companies does not include your name, address, email address or telephone number, but it may include the IP address of your computer.
