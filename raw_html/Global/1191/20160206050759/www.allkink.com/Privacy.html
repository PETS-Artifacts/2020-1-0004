			<h1 id="pagetitle">Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p>The following discloses our information gathering and 
			dissemination practices for the AllKink.com web site. </p>
			<p><strong>Overview</strong><br />
			As part of the normal operation of our services we collect and, in 
			some cases, may disclose information about you for the sole purpose 
			of advertising jockstraps and underwear. By accepting this Privacy 
			Policy and our Terms and Conditions, you expressly consent to our 
			use and disclosure of your personal information in the manner 
			described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is 
			incorporated into and subject to the terms of the AllKink.com Terms 
			and Conditions. </p>
			<p>1. <strong>A Special Note About Children</strong><br />
			Children are not eligible to use our services, and we ask that 
			minors (under the age of 18) not submit any personal information to 
			us and not use our web site in any way. </p>
			<p>2. <strong>Information We Collect</strong><br />
			Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide 
			you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. This allows 
			us to provide services and features and to customize our service to 
			make your experience better. Your name and email address are 
			confidential and will not be posted in your profile. Your profile is 
			available for other members to view. Your viewable profile does not 
			include any identifying information about you, except the 
			username/nickname you chose upon registering. </p>
			<p>Please note that your personally identifiable information will be 
			stored and processed on our computers in the United States. The laws 
			regarding the handling of personal data in the United States may 
			differ from the laws of other countries but, as we explain below,&nbsp; 
			AllKink.com will hold and transmit your information in a safe, 
			confidential and secure environment. </p>
			<p>We use data collection devices such as &quot;cookies&quot; on certain pages 
			of our Websites. &quot;Cookies&quot; are small files placed on your hard drive 
			that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer 
			certain features that are only available through the use of a 
			&quot;cookie.&quot; Cookies can also help us provide information which is 
			targeted to your interests. We use this information to determine our 
			members' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand 
			and serve you and our community. This information may include the 
			URL of the website that you visited prior to our Website (whether 
			this is on our site or not), the URL of the website you next go to 
			(whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser you are 
			using, and your Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address. Most cookies are 
			&quot;session cookies&quot;, meaning that they are automatically deleted from 
			your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to 
			decline our cookies if your browser permits. </p>
			<p>We use a third party advertising company to serve ads on our 
			behalf across the Internet. That advertising company may also 
			collect anonymous information about your visits to our Websites. 
			This is primarily accomplished through the use of a technology 
			device, commonly referred to as a Web beacon, cookie or an action 
			tag, which is placed on various Web pages within our Websites or in 
			an HTML e-mail that allows the third party advertising company to 
			collect anonymous information. There may also be a number of 
			services offered by external service providers that help you use our 
			Websites. If you choose to use these optional services, and in the 
			course of doing so, disclose information to the external service 
			providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about 
			you, then their use of your information is governed by their private 
			policies, if any. </p>
			<p>3. <strong>Our Use of Your Information</strong><br />
			We use information in the files we maintain about you, and the other 
			information we obtain from your current and past activities on 
			AllKink.com to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce 
			our Terms and Conditions. At times, we may review the data of 
			multiple members to identify problems or resolve disputes. </p>
			<p>You agree that we may use personally identifiable information 
			about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to 
			analyze Website usage, improve our content and product offerings, 
			and customize our Websites' content, layout, and services. These 
			uses improve our Websites and may better tailor them to meet your 
			needs. </p>
			<p>You agree that we may use your information to contact you and to 
			deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your 
			interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative 
			notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use 
			of AllKink.com. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly 
			agree to receive this information. </p>
			<p>4. <strong>Our Disclosure of Your Information</strong><br />
			Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we cannot 
			ensure that all of your private communications and other personally 
			identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not 
			otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example 
			(without limiting any of the foregoing), we may be required to 
			disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or 
			third parties. Under certain circumstances, third parties may 
			unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private 
			communications, or members may abuse or misuse your information that 
			they collect from our Websites. Accordingly, although we use 
			industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not 
			promise, and you should not expect, that your personally 
			identifiable information or private communications will always 
			remain private. </p>
			<p>As a matter of policy, we <strong>do not</strong> sell or rent 
			any personally identifiable information about you to any third 
			party. </p>
			<p><strong>Legal Requests.</strong> AllKink.com cooperates with law 
			enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce 
			laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights. 
			We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you 
			to law enforcement and other government officials as we, in our sole 
			discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with any 
			investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or 
			other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal 
			liability. </p>
			<p>5. <strong>Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Profile</strong><br />
			Following registration, you can review and change the information 
			you submitted during registration upon logging into AllKink.com.&nbsp; 
			At any time you may request to have your account deleted by emailing 
			webmaster@allkink.com.</p>
			<p>We will retain in our files information you have requested be 
			removed from our active databases for certain purposes, such as to 
			resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms and 
			conditions. Further, such prior information may never be completely 
			removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, 
			including stored 'back up' systems. Therefore, you should not expect 
			that all of your personally identifiable information will be 
			completely removed from our databases in response to any request you 
			may submit. </p>
			<p>6. <strong>Control of Your Password</strong><br />
			You are responsible for all actions taken with your login 
			information and password. Therefore we do not recommend that you 
			disclose your password or login information to any third party. If 
			you choose to share this information with any third party, you are 
			responsible for all actions taken with your login information and 
			password, and therefore should review each third party's privacy 
			policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose 
			substantial control over your personally identifiable information 
			and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. 
			Therefore, if your password has been compromised in any way, you 
			should immediately change your password. </p>
			<p>7. <strong>Other Information Collectors</strong><br />
			Except as otherwise expressly described in this Privacy Policy, this 
			document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we 
			collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information 
			to other parties, whether they are on our Website or on other sites 
			throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or 
			disclosure of the information you disclose to them. To the extent 
			that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own 
			privacy policies. Since AllKink.com does not control the privacy 
			policies of any third parties, you should investigate their policies 
			before you disclose your personal information to them. </p>
			<p>8. <strong>Notice</strong><br />
			We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on changes 
			in the law, your comments, or our need to accurately reflect our 
			data collection and disclosure practices. You may view these changes 
			at any time by clicking the Privacy Policy link near the bottom of 
			our homepage. </p>
