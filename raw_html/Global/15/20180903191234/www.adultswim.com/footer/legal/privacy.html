        Please note that the Services covered by this Privacy Policy may offer content (e.g., contests, sweepstakes, promotions, games, applications, or social network integrations) that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties.

        <strong>Cookies and Other User and Ad-Targeting Technologies.</strong> We use cookies and other technologies both to provide our Services to you and to advertise to you. We also may work with Partners to help them advertise to you when you visit other websites or mobile applications, and to help them perform user analytics. These technologies may also be used to analyze how our Users interact with advertising on our Services and elsewhere, and more generally, to learn more about our Users and what services or offers you might prefer to receive. We describe some of these technologies below.
      </p>
        <ol class='privacy-shift-list'>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Cookies.</strong> To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use ‚Äúcookies‚Äù, ‚Äúweb beacons‚Äù or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences. We use cookies or other tracking technologies to understand Service and Internet usage and to improve or customize the products, content, offerings, services or advertisements on our Services. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our Services (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to a Service), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our Services. We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate‚Äôs Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites. These cookies contain no information intended to identify you personally. The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form.
          </p>
          <p>
            We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Syncing Cookies and Identifiers.</strong> We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners‚Äô uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising.
        </li>
        <li>

        <strong>OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR PRIVACY</strong>
        <ol class='privacy-shift-list'>
          <li>
            <strong>International Transfer</strong>
            <p>
              We operate globally, so we do need to transfer your Information internationally. In particular, your Information will be transferred to and processed in the United States where many of our central databases operate. We use European Commission approved contract clauses to protect your Information, an appropriate Privacy Shield certification or a vendor's Processor Binding Corporate Rules.  A copy of the relevant mechanism can be provided for your review on request to our Privacy Policy Coordinator using the details set out below.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Security</strong>
            <p>
              We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to help prevent unauthorized access, to maintain data security, and to use correctly the Information we collect online. These safeguards vary based on the sensitivity of the Information that we collect and store.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of Information, we cannot assure you that Information will never be disclosed, altered or destroyed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy policy.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Retention of Your Information</strong>
            <p>
              We keep details of users who have registered for a Service with us for as long as you use the Service and for up to 18 months afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you make payments in connection with the Services, we keep payment data for 13 months after the date of payment.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you contact us with support queries, we keep the data for between 3 and 18 months, depending on the nature of the query and whether you have registered with us for a Service.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our cookies and other tracking technologies expire 13 months from the date after you give or renew consent for us to use these technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we process Information for marketing purposes, we process the Information while you remain interested in the marketing (for example, where you open and read our offers) and for three years after that point. If you ask us to stop sending marketing we will keep your Information for a short period after this (to allow us to implement your requests). We also keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing or to process your Information indefinitely so that we can respect your request in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where we process Information for Service security purposes, we retain it for 6 months.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Your Rights/How to Contact Us</strong>
            <p>
              You have the right to ask us for a copy of your Information, to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your Information; and to obtain the Information you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share this Information to another controller.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition, you can object to the processing of your Information in some circumstances (in particular, where we do not have to process the Information to meet a contractual or other legal requirement).
            </p>
            <p>
              These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal Information about another person, or if you ask us to delete Information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping.
            </p>
            <p>
              Where you have given consent to our using your Information for marketing, you can withdraw your consent at any time. You can also ask us not to carry out profiling for direct marketing purposes. You can opt out of receiving email newsletters and other marketing communications by following the opt-out instructions provided to you in those emails. If you sign up to receive SMS or MMS messages, you can unsubscribe from those messages received by replying "STOP".
            </p>
            <p>
              To exercise any of these rights, you can use our data subject <a target="blank" href="https://app-eu.onetrust.com/app/#/webform/0cfd8893-ae62-4831-bd63-d4d6840b1178">request form</a> or get in touch with us or our Privacy Policy Coordinator using the details set out below. Please include your registration Information such as first name, last name and e-mail address in the request. We may ask you to provide additional Information for identity verification purposes, or to verify that you are in possession of an applicable email account.
            </p>
            <p>
              You also have a right to complain to a supervisory authority for data protection in the country where you live, where you work, or where you consider that a breach of data protection has occurred, although we hope that we can assist with any queries or concerns you may have about our use of your Information. Our Data Protection Officer can be contacted with any such queries or concerns about our use of our information at the contact details listed below.
