Users on the Premium Services (as described in the Terms of Service section 2.1.2) can choose to allow the diagram data to be public (as outlined above) or they can choose to make it available via an obfuscated URL (please see details at <a href="http://creately.com/plans">http://creately.com/plans</a>).</p>
<p>When you are creating a public diagram or sharing a public diagram, the Application will display that the diagram is being made public and is accessible to any user who visits the website.</p>
<p>The application Creately stores information on diagrams saved, descriptions, meta-data and any other associated information required to provide a useful collaborative diagramming application.
