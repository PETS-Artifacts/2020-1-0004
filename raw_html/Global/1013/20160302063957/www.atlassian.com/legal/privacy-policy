href="https://www.atlassian.com/legal/archives/">view archived versions</a>)</p> <h2>Introduction</h2> <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information Atlassian Pty Ltd and its related entities ("Atlassian") collect about you and why, what we do with that information, how we share it, and how we handle the content you place in our products and services. It also explains the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information.</p> <h2>Scope of Privacy Policy</h2> <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the information that we obtain through your use of &quot;Atlassian Services&quot; via a &quot;Device&quot; or when you otherwise interact with Atlassian.</p> <p>&quot;<strong>Atlassian Services</strong>&quot; include our:</p> <ol class="def"> <li>Websites</li> <li>SaaS Products</li> <li>Downloadable Products</li> </ol> <p>but does not include:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>Atlassian products or services for which a separate privacy policy is provided.</li> <li>Third Party Products. These are third party products or services that you may choose to integrate with Atlassian product or services, such as third party Add-Ons available in the Atlassian Marketplace. You should always review the policies of third party products and services to make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they collect and use your information.</li> </ul> <p>A &quot;<strong>Device</strong>&quot; is any computer used to access the Atlassian Services, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device.</p> <p>Unless otherwise stated, our SaaS Products and our Downloadable Products are treated the same for the purposes of this document.</p> <p>By registering for or using Atlassian Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <div class="definition"> <h2>Definitions</h2> <p><strong>Add-On</strong>: a bundle of code, resources and configuration files that can be used with an Atlassian product to add new functionality or to change the behavior of that product&#39;s existing features.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: any information or data that you upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlassian Service.</p> <p><strong>Downloadable Products</strong>: Atlassian&#39;s downloadable software products and mobile applications, including Add-Ons created by Atlassian, that are installed by customers on an infrastructure of their choice. Downloadable Products do not include Add-Ons created by third parties, even when they are accessed through Atlassian.com or available through the Atlassian Marketplace.</p> <p><strong>Information</strong>: all of the different forms of data, content, and information collected by us as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Personal Information</strong>: information that may be used to readily identify or contact you as an individual person, such as: name, address, email address, or phone number. Personal Information does not include information that has been anonymized such that it does not allow for the ready identification of specific individuals.</p> <p><strong>SaaS Products</strong>: Atlassian&#39;s &quot;Cloud&quot; hosted solutions, as well as other Atlassian hosted solutions that display a link to this Privacy Policy (such as HipChat and Bitbucket). For the avoidance of doubt, if an Atlassian hosted solution displays a link to a different privacy policy, then that other privacy policy shall apply.</p> <p><strong>Websites</strong>: Atlassian&#39;s websites, including but not limited to atlassian.com, marketplace.atlassian.com, answers.atlassian.com, confluence.atlassian.com, support.atlassian.com, hipchat.com, bitbucket.org, and any related websites, sub-domains and pages.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h2> <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we will notify you by revising the &quot;Effective Starting&quot; date at the top of this Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes, we will provide you with additional notice (such as by adding a notice on the Atlassian Services homepages, login screens, or by sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy whenever you use Atlassian Services to stay informed about our information practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy.</p> <p>If you disagree with any changes to this Privacy Policy, you will need to stop using Atlassian Services and deactivate your account(s), as outlined below.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information you provide to us</h2> <p>We collect the following information:</p> <p><strong>Account and Profile Information</strong>: We collect information about you and your company as you register for an account, create or modify your profile, make purchases through, use, access, or interact with the Atlassian Services (including but not limited to when you upload, download, collaborate on or share Content). Information we collect includes</p> <ul class="def"> <li>Contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and phone number</li> <li>Billing information such as credit card details and billing address</li> <li>Profile information such as a username, profile photo, and job title</li> <li>Preferences information such as notification and marketing preferences</li> </ul> <p>You may provide this information directly when you enter it in Atlassian Services.</p> <p>In some cases another user (such as a system administrator) may create an account on your behalf and may provide your information, including Personal Information (most commonly when your company requests that you use our products). We collect Information under the direction of our customers and often have no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data we process. If you are an employee of one of our customers and would no longer like us to process your information, please contact your employer. If you are providing information (including Personal Information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p> <p><strong>Content</strong>: We collect and store Content that you create, input, submit, post, upload, transmit, store or display in the process of using our SaaS Products or Websites. Such Content includes any Personal Information or other sensitive information that you choose to include (&quot;incidentally-collected Personal Information&quot;).</p> <p><strong>Other submissions</strong>: We collect other data that you submit to our Websites or as you participate in any interactive features of the Atlassian Services, participate in a survey, contest, promotion, sweepstakes, activity or event, apply for a job, request customer support, communicate with us via third party social media sites or otherwise communicate with us. For example, information regarding a problem you are experiencing with an Atlassian product could be submitted to our Support Services or posted in our public forums.</p> </div> <div class="definition"> <h2>Information we collect from your use of Atlassian Services</h2> <p><strong>Web Logs</strong>: As is true with most websites and services delivered over the Internet, we gather certain information and store it in log files when you interact with our Websites and SaaS Products. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, internet service provider, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, information you search for, locale and language preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, and system configuration information. In the case of our SaaS Product, the URLs you accessed (and therefore included in our log files) include usernames as well as elements of Content (such as JIRA project names, project keys, status names, and JQL filters, and Confluence page titles and space names) as necessary for the SaaS Product to perform the requested operations. Occasionally, we connect Personal Information to information gathered in our log files as necessary to improve Atlassian Services for individual customers. In such a case, we would treat the combined Information in accordance with this privacy policy.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information from Website and SaaS Products</strong>: We collect analytics information when you use our Websites and SaaS Products to help us improve our products and services. In the SaaS Products, this analytics information consists of the feature and function of the Atlassian Service being used, the associated license identifier (SEN) and domain name, the username and IP address of the individual who is using the feature or function (which will include Personal Information if the Personal Information was incorporated into the username), the sizes and original filenames of attachments, and additional information required to detail the operation of the function and which parts of the Atlassian Services are being affected. For example:</p> <ul class="def"> <li>In JIRA, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a project includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the project, the project key input by the user, the name of the template used (if any), and the name of the project. Similarly, analytics information that we collect when an issue is edited includes the system-assigned numeric issue id, the issue key (which consists of the project key and a system-generated sequence number), whether the edit is made by a user or automatically generated by the system, and whether email notifications are to be sent.</li> <li>In Confluence, analytics information that we collect when a user creates a page includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the page, the blueprint used to create the page, the key of the space in which the page is being created, and the page title. An example of analytics information that we collect when a user creates a new blueprint includes the system-generated numeric identifier of the blueprint, the key of the space in which the blueprint is being created, and the blueprint name and description.</li> </ul> <p>As shown in the examples above, the analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing. As such, the analytics information we collect may include Personal Information or sensitive business information that the user has included in Content that the user chose to upload, submit, post, create, transmit, store or display in an Atlassian Service.</p> <p>As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics as an analytics provider. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/" target="_blank">Google&#39;s Policies and Principles</a>. Use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> to prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information Derived from Content</strong>. Analytics information also consists of data we collect as a result of running queries against Content across our user base for the purposes of generating Usage Data. &quot;Usage Data&quot; is aggregated data about a group or category of services, features or users that does not contain Personal Information. For example, we may query Content to determine the most common types of workflows that users use (e.g. what percentage of all instances use ITIL style workflows?) by searching for the most common workflow names, or we may query Content to determine the most popular job titles for Confluence users in order to better understand the composition of our user base.</p> <p>Though we may happen upon sensitive or Personal Information as we compile Usage Data from Content across user instances, this is a byproduct of our efforts to understand broader patterns and trends. It is not a concerted effort by us to examine the Content of any particular customer.</p> <p><strong>Analytics Information from Downloadable Products</strong>: We collect analytics information when you use our Downloadable Products to help us improve our products and services. Our Downloadable Products contain a feature that sends information about the technical operation of the Downloadable Products on your systems (&quot;System Information&quot;) to us. System Information includes information about (a) the server environment in which the Downloadable Product is operating: OS type and version, JVM version, Java environment properties, CPU type, RAM allocation, language and locale settings, database type and version, and disk utilization, as well as (b) user client information, for example: browser type and version, native client type and version, and client device specifications (e.g. screen resolution, OS version, device type, etc.). In addition, we collect analytics information from Downloadable Products that is a subset of the analytics information described above for Websites and SaaS Products. As with Websites and SaaS Products, the analytics information we collect includes elements of Content related to the function the user is performing, but with an important caveat. With the Downloadable Products, before sending the information to Atlassian&#39;s servers, we filter the analytics information to remove elements that we believe may contain sensitive or Personal Information. For example: (1) we conduct a one-way hash of usernames and hostnames before collecting them and (2) we filter any Content elements we collect to discard all words except those on a list of common business and IT terminology. You can disable our collection of analytics information from Downloadable Products via the Administrator settings or by blocking collection at the local network level.</p> <p><strong>Installer Analytics, Software Updates &amp; License Information from Downloadable Products</strong>: During the installation of our Downloadable Products, the installer sends analytics information to Atlassian to allow us to understand where in the installation process users are experiencing trouble or dropping out. Our Downloadable Products also communicate with Atlassian servers for licensing purposes, as well as to check for updates, patches, and compatibility with Add-Ons. Examples of information we collect for these purposes include the name and version of the Downloadable Product and the server ID, SEN, and IP address of the customer instance.</p> <p><strong>Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies</strong>: Atlassian and our third party partners, such as our advertising and analytics partners, use various technologies to collect information, such as cookies and web beacons. Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory. We use cookies to improve and customize Atlassian Services and your experience; to allow you to access and use the Websites or SaaS Products without re-entering your username or password; and to count visits and understand which areas and features of the Websites and SaaS Products are most popular. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from websites you visit.
