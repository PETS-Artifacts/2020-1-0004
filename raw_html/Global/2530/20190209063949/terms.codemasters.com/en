Such Service Providers are required under their contract with us, to handle your Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws and principles related to privacy and data protection;</li>

    <li>to other persons where we are under a legal obligation to disclose your Personal Information, and only as permitted or required by applicable law or regulation. Such disclosure could be made to courts, to respond to lawful requests by public authorities, regulators and law enforcement agencies in the European Union and around the world or to protect and defend our rights or property.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>International Transfers</b></p>
<p>Codemasters Affiliates and Service Providers are located throughout the world. Accordingly, your Personal Data may be sent to countries which have different levels of data protection laws than your country of residence. For instance, if you inquire about services we provide outside the UK, we will forward your inquiry to the appropriate offices in such countries. We may also make other disclosures of your Personal Information overseas, for example if we receive a legal or regulatory request from a foreign law enforcement body.</p>
<p>We will always take steps to ensure that any international transfer of information is carefully managed to protect your rights and interests</p>
<ul class="indent">
    <li>we will only transfer your Personal Information to countries which are recognised as providing an adequate level of legal protection or where we can be satisfied that alternative arrangements are in place to protect your privacy rights,</li>
    <li>any requests for information we receive from law enforcement or regulators will be carefully checked before Personal Information is disclosed</li>
</ul>
<p>We will, on request, provide you with further details regarding the categories of recipient of your Personal Information and the countries to which your Personal Information may be transferred. You have the right to ask us for more information about the safeguards we have put in place as mentioned above. Contact us as set out in contact us section if you would like further information</p>
<p><b>How we protect and store your information</b></p>
<p>We take the security of the information we collect seriously. We have implemented and we maintain technical and organisational security measures, policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the data concerned. Some of the steps we take are: placing confidentiality requirements on our staff members and Service Providers; destroying or permanently anonymising Personal Information if it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected.</p>
<p><b>Retention of your personal information</b></p>
<p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as is reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, as explained in this Notice. In some circumstances we may retain your Personal Information for longer periods of time, for instance where we are required to do so in accordance with legal, regulatory, tax or accounting requirements.</p>
<p>In specific circumstances we may retain your Personal Information for longer periods of time so that we have an accurate record of your dealings with us in the event of any complaints or challenges, or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of litigation relating to your Personal Information or dealings.</p>
<p>Where we have obtained your Personal Information in order to provide you with marketing information for our services, it will be stored by us only as long as you do not change your mind to receive such materials from Codemasters, in order to avoid future contact with you for marketing purposes. We maintain a data retention notice which we apply to records in our care. Where your Personal Information is no longer required we will ensure that it is securely deleted.</p>

<h3>COOKIE INFORMATION</h3>
<p>We use cookies (information stored by your browser) to track information on the pages read by visitors to our sites to improve the content and offerings on our sites. Cookies are small text files that websites can send to your computer. A cookie can be thought of as an internet user’s identification card, which tells a website when the user has returned. The cookies we use are “analytical” cookies.</p>
<p>They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and see how visitors move around our sites when they are using them. Read more about the individual analytical cookies we use and how to recognise them at <a href="mailto:aboutcookies.codemasters.com">aboutcookies.codemasters.com</a>. Although we cannot identify individuals from this information, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.</p>
<p>The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications 2003, as amended by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendment) Regulations 2016 (the "Directive"), recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of website users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used (which is exactly what we are doing here!), and to provide some information on how cookies are used.</p>
<p>You can find more information on this subject at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>. Lastly, the Directive places an obligation on websites to make users aware that they can set their computers to reject cookies. You can do this by activating a setting in your internet browser to reject all cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. You can find instructions on how to do this at <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/" target="_blank">www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you first access our websites. However, you should be aware that our websites will not work without cookies and therefore we recommend you leave them turned on.</p>

<li>Names causing mockery or imitation of any Codemasters in-game personality or character.</li>

<p>In certain Codemasters online games, it may be possible for you to purchase a rename for one or more of your avatars via the game shop.

<p>If any of your display names, or game avatars are in violation of any of the above naming rules, the Codemasters Accounts Support Team reserves the right to either:</p>
