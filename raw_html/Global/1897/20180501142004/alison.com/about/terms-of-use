<h4 id="alison_cookie_policy" style="padding-top: 100px; margin-top: -100px;">Alison Cookies Policy</h4>
<p><em style="font-style: italic;">Effective Date: January 23, 2018</em></p>
<h5>What are cookies?</h5>
<p>Cookies are small text files placed onto your computer or device as you browse the Internet. Cookies can be used to collect, store and share bits of information about your activities across websites and services, including on Alison. They also allow us to remember things about your visit to Alison, such as your preferred language and other choices/settings and generally make the site easier for you to use.</p>
<p>Alison uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie is used to identify a particular visit to Alison. These cookies expire after a short time, or when you close your web browser after using Alison. We use these cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, such as when you log into Alison. A persistent cookie will remain on your devices for a set period of time specified in the cookie. We use these cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period of time. For example, we would use a persistent cookie if you asked that we keep you signed in.</p>
<h5>Why does Alison use cookies and similar technologies?</h5>
<p>Alison uses cookies and similar technologies, such as web beacons, browser cookies, pixel tags, or local shared objects (&ldquo;flash cookies&rdquo;), to deliver, measure, and improve our services in various ways. We use cookies both when you access our site and services on a browser, as well as through our native mobile app. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.</p>
<p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
<p><strong style="margin-right: 0;">Authentication and security:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To log you into Alison;</li>
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To protect your security;
<p><br />and</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate Alison&rsquo;s agreements and terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, these technologies help authenticate your access to Alison and prevent unauthorized parties from accessing your accounts.</p>
<p><strong style="margin-right: 0;">Preferences:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To remember information about your browser and your preferences;
<p><br />and</p>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To remember your settings and other choices you have made.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, cookies help us remember your preferred language or the country that you are in. We can then provide you with content in your preferred language without having to ask you each time you visit Alison.</p>
<p><strong style="margin-right: 0;">Analytics and research:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To help us improve and understand how people use Alison.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, cookies help us test different versions of Alison to see which particular features or content users prefer. We may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether the message has been opened and for other analytics. We might also optimize and improve your experience on Alison by using cookies to see how you interact with Alison, such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on.</p>
<p>To help us better understand how people use Alison, we work with a number of analytics partners, including Google Analytics. These providers use cookies and similar technologies to help us analyze how users use the Services, including by noting the third-party Services from which you arrive. The information collected will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of Alison. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-Out plugin by <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">clicking here</a>.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t release the information collected from our own cookies to any third parties, other than to our service providers who assist us in these activities.</p>
<p><strong style="margin-right: 0;">Personalized content:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To customize Alison with more relevant content.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong style="margin-right: 0;">Advertising:</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
<li style="list-style-type: initial;">To provide you with more relevant advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p>As explained further in our <a href="#alison_privacy_policy">Privacy Policy</a>, third-parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via Alison may use cookies to collect information about your activities on the Services, other sites, and/or the ads you have clicked on. This information may be used by them to serve ads that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you and measure the effectiveness of their ads. Targeting and advertising cookies we use may include <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics</a> and other advertising networks and services we use from time to time.</p>
<p>For more information about targeting and advertising cookies and how you can opt out, you can visit <a href="http://youronlinechoices.eu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">youronlinechoices.eu</a> or <a href="http://allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html</a>. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into Alison, you may still receive advertising content even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the advertising content will just not be tailored to your interests. Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.</p>
<p>When accessing Alison from a mobile application, you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, such as iOS and Android, provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or operating system or contact the applicable platform operator.</p>

If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in, customize, or use some of the interactive features of Alison.</li>
