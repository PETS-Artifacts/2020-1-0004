  <p>Yola complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the US-Swiss Safe 
Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the 
collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union 
member countries and Switzerland.  Yola has certified that it adheres to the 
Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security,

the policies in this Policy and the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles, the Safe 
Harbor Privacy Principles shall govern.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor 
program, and to view our certification page, please visit <a class="external"

    <h2>Registration</h2>
    <p>Registration forms contain both mandatory fields (as indicated) and 
non-mandatory fields; if you choose not to complete the mandatory fields then 
Yola may not be able to respond to your request or activate your option 
choices. By using the Yola Toolset and/or the Yola webSite, you consent to 
any transfer of personal information, collected by Yola, outside your country 
for the purposes of storing the information where Yola and/or its agents 
maintain their facilities.</p>

    <h2>Service Providers</h2>
    <p>In the event that Yola transfers your personal information to a third party 
that is acting as an agent, Yola will ensure that the third party subscribes 
to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or is subject to the Directive or another 
adequacy finding. As an alternative, Yola can enter into a written agreement 
with such third party requiring that the third party provide at least the same 
level of privacy protection as is required by the relevant principles.</p>

    <h2>Hosted websites</h2>
    <p>Users publishing websites to a free subdomain or a custom domain managed 
by Yola, will be provided with DDoS protection and DNS management capabilities. 
Yola uses Cloudflare to provide DDoS protection and DNS services for the Yola 
Toolset, Yola Website and customer websites. A copy of Cloudflare’s privacy 
policy is available <a class="external" 
href="https://www.cloudflare.com/security-policy">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Yola may amend this Policy from time to time to remain consistent with the 
requirements of the Safe Harbor. We will post any revised policy on this Site, 
and we will provide email and/or other notifications of any substantial changes. 
Your use of the Site after the revised Policy has been posted will constitute 
your consent to such revised Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal 
information is used, you should subscribe to our blog RSS feed at
<a href="https://www.yola.com/blog/">https://www.yola.com/blog/</a> or e-mail us at
<a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>. This will not prevent
Yola from using your personal information for the specific purposes for which it 
was collected.</p>
    <p>Our Postal Address is:</p>
    <p>909 Montgomery St. STE 104, San Francisco, CA 94133</p>
    <p>We can be reached via e-mail at <a 
href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>We collect two basic types of information with our service, namely 
personal information and aggregate information. As used herein, the term 
&ldquo;personal information&rdquo; means information that specifically 
identifies an individual (such as a name and e-mail address), and demographic 
and other information about an individual when directly linked to personally 
identifiable information. A user name may be personal information if it 
includes personally identifying information such as a first and last name. 
Our definition of personal information does not include 
&ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; information (see below).</p>

    <h2>Aggregate Information</h2>
    <p>Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of 
services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In 
other words, information on how you use our service may be collected and 
combined with information about how others use the service, but no personal 
information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us 
understand trends in our users&rsquo; needs so that we can better consider new 
features or otherwise tailor our service. This policy in no way restricts or 
limits our collection and use of aggregate information, and we may share 
aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, 
including to help us better understand and improve our service, and for 
advertising and marketing purposes.</p>

    <h2>Updating/Accessing/Amending Personally Identifiable Information</h2>
    <p>If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no 
longer desire our service, you may update your profile or delete it by 
clicking on the Profile link after you log in and then clicking the Delete 
Account link at the bottom of the page. Alternatively, you can email our 
Customer Support at&nbsp; <a 
href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Google Apps&trade; users:</strong> Deleting the Yola app from 
your Google Apps&trade; Control Panel DOES NOT delete your Yola account. To 
delete your Yola account, please follow the instructions provided above.</p>

    <h2>Active Collection</h2>
    <p>Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you 
visit our Site. We may collect certain information you voluntarily provide 
to us which may contain personal information. For example, we may collect 
your name, address, email address, user name and other contact and demographic 
information when you register and set up an account or contact us by e-mail or 
other means. .We may also collect payment information if applicable. In addition, 
from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal 
information you voluntarily provide to us, such as in connection with your 
participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and 
other activities on the Site.</p>
    <p>For each registered user of the Site (each a &quot;Registered 
User&quot;) to the Yola website, our Web server automatically recognizes any 
header information that is shared with our Web server. Yola collects the IP 
address and header information, and may collect the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The e-mail address of Registered Users of our website and the 
Yola Toolset, so that we and our partners may communicate with Registered Users;</li>
        <li>The e-mail addresses of Registered Users who post messages to our 
bulletin board, communicate with us via e-mail, and/or make postings to our chat 
areas; Aggregate information on what pages Registered Users access or visit; 
Registered User-specific information on what pages Registered Users access or 
visit; and Personal information may also be collected if you leave comments or 
other communications on the Site, such as on the Yola Bulletin Board and/or chat 
areas, and/or send email directly to Yola. By doing so your name and the content 
of your communication may be made public and can be read, collected, or used by 
other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. 
We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to 
submit in these forums.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>As mentioned above, we automatically receive certain types of 
information whenever you interact with us. For example, when you use the website, 
our systems may automatically collect your IP address and the type of operating 
system or browser you use. We may also collect information pertaining to your 
account activity, and standard access information, such as the time and date of 
your accessing the service and your usage of the service. We use such 
information for purposes such as compiling aggregated statistics about service 
usage, developing new features, and improving our services.</p>
    <p>We may also use cookie technology to collect information. Among other 
things, the use of cookies enables us to:</p>

the internet.</li>
        <li>Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads

    <p>A cookie is a small amount of data, often including an anonymous 
unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website&rsquo;s 
computers and stored on your computer&rsquo;s hard drive. Most browsers 
automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify the 
setting to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the 
sites you visit by editing browser options. However, if a browser is set not 
to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site 
and the service may not function properly. For example, you may not be able 
to sign in and may not be able to access certain Site features or 
services.</p>

    <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
    <p>The use of cookies by our partners and affiliates is not covered by 
our Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners 
and affiliates use session ID cookies on their websites once you leave Yola 
to give you access to Yola discounts and promotions.</p>

    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>If you click on a link to a third party site, you will leave the Yola 
site you are visiting and go to the site you selected. Because we cannot 
control the activities of third parties, we cannot accept responsibility for 
any use of your personally identifiable information by such third parties, 
and we cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy practices 
as Yola. If you visit a third party website that is linked to from a Yola 
site, you should read that website&rsquo;s privacy statement before providing 
any personally identifiable information.</p>

    <h2>ShareThis</h2>
    <p>When you use ShareThis to bookmark and share our products and site, 
you will be taken to a third party site and note that their privacy policy 
governs the collection and use of the information collected on those 
sites.</p>

    <h2>Information about Children</h2>
    <p>Our service is not intended to be used by children under the age of 
13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 
the age of 13 except in compliance with applicable law.</p>

    <h2>Use and Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>In general, we use personal information we collect to process your 
requests or transactions, to provide you with information or services you 
request, to inform you about other information, events, promotions, products 
or services we think will be of interest to you, to facilitate your use of, 
and our administration and operation of, the Site, newsletters and for the 
purpose for which the information was provided. We may also use the personal 
information we collect to improve the content of our Web page and to 
customize the advertising and the content and/or layout of our page for our 
visitors and individual Registered Users. We also use this information to 
notify Registered Users about updates to our website, and to contact 
Registered Users for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when 
individuals are first asked to provide Personal Information to Yola, or as 
soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before Yola uses or 
discloses the Information for a purpose other than for which it was originally 
collected.  Yola will offer individuals the opportunity to opt-out whether 
their Personal Information is to be disclosed to a third party for a purpose 
other than for which it was collected. If you wish to opt out in this manner, 
please send an email to <a href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>
    <p>We will not share the personal information we collect from you through 
the Site with any other company except as provided in this Policy, as it may 
be revised form time to time. Yola reserves the right to disclose or transfer 
such information to a third party if we believe in good faith that we are 
lawfully authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably 
necessary or appropriate to comply with the law or with legal process or 
authorities, respond to any claims, or to protect the rights, property or 
safety of Yola, our users, our employees or the public, including without 
limitation to protect Yola or our users or the public from fraudulent, 
abusive, inappropriate or unlawful use of our Site, or if we believe in good 
faith that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious 
physical injury to any person, or other irreparable injury, including 
economic interests of Yola or a third party, requires disclosure of the 
information.</p>

    <h2>Network and Information Security</h2>
    <p>We use reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized release of or access 
to your personal data. However, we cannot guarantee that your information 
will not be disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the 
unauthorized acts of others. If Yola learns of a security systems breach, 
then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take 
appropriate protective steps. Yola may also post a notice on the Site if a 
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal 
right to receive notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free 
written notice of a security breach, you should notify us at <a 
href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a>.</p>
    <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you 
enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social 
security number, national ID, personal health information) on our 
registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket 
layer technology (SSL). Credit card details are stored in our Payment 
Gateway&#x27;s highly secure Payment Vault that is fully compliant with the 
Payment Card Industry&#x27;s Data Security Standards.</p>

    <h2>Electronic Communication</h2>
    <p>We will communicate with you via email. Yola intends to send regular 
email updates and occasional promotional offers that may be of interest to 
you. You may opt-out of these mailings at any time. If you do not want to 
receive marketing and promotional e-mails from us in the future, please let 
us know by sending us an e-mail to <a 
href="mailto:support@yola.com">support@yola.com</a> or follow the unsubscribe 
instructions that are included in each email communication.</p>
    <p>This will not prevent us from sending you operational, account related 
or other non-marketing emails. If you wish to no longer receive these emails 
please deactivate your account by clicking on the Profile link after you log 
in and then clicking the Delete Account link at the bottom of the page. 
Alternatively, you can email our Customer Support at <a
