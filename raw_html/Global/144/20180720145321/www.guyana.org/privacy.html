  Do not post any messages that are obscene, vulgar, sexually-orientated, racist, 
  hateful, threatening, or that otherwise violate any laws. Please use good judgement 
  when choosing user names, avatars, or images to post, inappropriate content 
  will be removed without notice. </font>

  Please make sure that your posts are positive, constructive, and on the topic. 
  We may delete individual posts that could ruin a good topic thread. As much 
  as we allow members to freely express their opinions. </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">There 
  is a limit as to what we will tolerate. If a member starts spreading lies, rumors

  <b>4) We reserve the right to remove any topics deemed inappropriate or disruptive 
  to our community.</b></font> 
<P align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5) 
  Do not make offensive posts, links or images. Do not post NSFW content. NSFW 
  ("Not Safe For Work") is defined as anything that most people would not want 
  seen by their bosses, parents or teachers. Do not use profanity, racial, ethnic, 
  religious, or other slurs and stereotypes, or post sexually-oriented material, 
  masturbatory and excretory references, or any other offensive material. </font>

  7) Do not post any messages that harass, insult (name calling), belittle, threaten 
  or mock other members. Debates are fine, but critique the opinion, not the person. 
  Personal attacks are not permitted. Do not use sweeping generalizations and 
  plural pronouns to cloak personal attacks. For example if a poster(s) states 
  that he thinks 'x' is a good idea, replying that "Anyone who supports 'x' is 
  an idiot" is a personal attack. </font>
