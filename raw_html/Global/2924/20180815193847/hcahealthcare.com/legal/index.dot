          <h2>Accessibility</h2>

Date: August 15, 2018

<h3>What Is Website Accessibility?</h3>
<p>For the web, accessibility means that people with disabilities, including people with age-related impairments, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with websites and tools, and that they can contribute equally without barriers.</p>

<h3>Website Accessibility Statement</h3>
<p>We are committed to improving the accessibility and usability of our websites for the
	greatest number of people possible. We are striving for the highest level of accessibility
	for people with disabilities and making every reasonable effort to ensure that all of our
	websites are accessible by persons who use assistive technologies such as automated
	tools, keyboard-only navigation, and screen readers.</p>

<p>Currently, we are in the process of updating our websites to implement relevant portions
	of the Section 508 Web Accessibility Standards developed by the United States Access
	Board, as well as the World Wide Web Consortium's (W3C) Web Content Accessibility
	Guidelines 2.0, as our web accessibility standard. The accessibility of our websites will be
	programmatically evaluated, as well as tested with assistive technology, including but not
	limited to screen readers and screen magnifiers.  We will also test our sites with users with
	disabilities who use these technologies. These processes will facilitate accessibility for everyone,
	regardless of disability or device used to access information on our websites.</p>

<p>On an ongoing and periodic basis, we will audit our websites to ensure conformance with
	our web accessibility standard and/or to identify where support and guidance is needed to
	facilitate website accessibility efforts.</p>

<h3>Contact Us with Website Accessibility Questions or Comments</h3>
<p>Please be aware that these efforts are active and ongoing. If, at any time, you have specific
	questions or concerns about the accessibility of any particular webpage, please contact us by filling out the <a href="#accessibilityForm">Website Accessibility Contact Form</a> so that we may be of further assistance.
	

<p><strong>Please note that the Website Accessibility Contact Form is for visitors using assistive technology, those with other disabilities or impairments, who may need further assistance or who would like to report an accessibility issue. For all other inquiries, please visit our general <a href="/contact-us">Contact Us</a> page.</strong></p>

          <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>Updated as of May 30, 2018</p>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to the care and improvement of human life, and that includes protecting Personal Information (defined below).  We are dedicated to maintaining information confidentiality and complying with regulatory requirements by – among other things – limiting access to only those users that have a legitimate need to view it, and regularly educating employees on information protection.</p>

<p>This privacy policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) covers our online privacy practices with respect to use and/or disclosure of information we may collect from you when you access or use our this website (&ldquo;Website&rdquo;), Portals (as defined below), and any other websites or applications we may provide that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, our &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). The Services are provided by the Website owner identified on the Website homepage (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;us,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy does not apply to information collected through other means, such as by telephone or in person. Please review our privacy practices and contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@hcahealthcare.com">privacy@hcahealthcare.com</a> if you have questions.</p>

<h2>Information Collected through the Website</h2>
<p>Our Website may include pages that give you the opportunity to provide us with Personal Information about yourself. As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that may be used, either alone or in combination with other information, to personally identify an individual.</p>

<p>We collect certain information, including Personal Information, from and about our Website users in three ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>directly from you</li>
	<li>directly from our web server logs</li>
	<li>with cookies</li>
</ul>

<h3>Information Provided by You</h3>
<p>We and our service providers collect Personal Information through online forms in order to provide certain features of the Services to you.  For example, if applying for a job through the Website, we may request you to fill out a form with information such as your name, e-mail address, phone number, and work experience. If you do not provide the information required to submit the forms, we may not be able to provide you with related features and services.</p>

<p>In some cases, you may have the opportunity to enter into our secure forms any content that you choose.  You are responsible for such content.</p>

<h3>Web Server Logs</h3>
<p>When you access or use our Services, we may track information to administer our Services and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Your Internet protocol address</li>
	<li>The kind of browser or computer you use</li>
	<li>Number of links you click within our Services</li>
	<li>State or country from which you accessed our Services</li>
	<li>Date and time of your visit</li>
	<li>Name of your Internet service provider</li>
	<li>Third party websites you linked to from our Services</li>
	<li>Pages or information you viewed on our Services</li>
</ul>

<p>We use this information to analyze trends, administer and improve our Services, and monitor traffic and usage patterns for information security purposes and to help make our Services more useful.</p>

<h3>Cookies and Web Beacons</h3>
<p>A &ldquo;cookie&rdquo; is a small text file that may be transferred to your computer's hard drive in order to personalize our services for you and to collect aggregate information regarding usage of our Services by all of our users. Each computer is assigned a different cookie that contains a random, unique number. Our Services uses two different types of cookies: a &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookie, which is required to track a user session, for example, and which expires shortly after the session ends), and a &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; cookie, used to track unique visits to the Portal (defined below), as well as how the user arrived at the Portal (for example, through an email link or from a referral link), and the type of user (patient, provider, etc.). So that users are not counted twice, this cookie can &ldquo;persist&rdquo; anywhere from six months to two years.</p>

<p>Your browser software can be set to warn you of cookies or reject all cookies. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the &ldquo;Help&rdquo; section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookie, this may disable some of the functionality of our Services and you may not be able to use certain services.</p>

<p>Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you personalize a web page, or navigate within a website, a cookie helps the website to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of delivering relevant content and eases website navigation by providing and saving your preferences and login information as well as providing personalized functionality.</p>

<p>We use Google Analytics on our Site to help us analyze the traffic on our Site.  For more information on Google Analytics’ processing of Personal Information, please see <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/" target="_blank">http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.&rdquo;  By using a <a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/plugin/" target="_blank">browser plugin</a> provided by Google, you can opt out of Google Analytics.</p>

<p>Some of features on our Services (such as social media widgets that allow you to share content) may use cookies or other methods to gather information regarding your use of the Services, and may combine the information in these cookies with any of Personal Information about you that they may have. The use of such information by a third party depends on the privacy policy of that third party.</p>

<p>A &ldquo;web beacon,&rdquo; &ldquo;clear GIF,&rdquo; &ldquo;web bug,&rdquo; or &ldquo;pixel tag&rdquo; is a tiny graphic file with a unique identifier that is similar in function to a cookie, but would allow us to count the number of users that have visited certain pages or screens of our websites, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, web beacons can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. In contrast to cookies, which may be stored on your computer's hard drive, web beacons are typically embedded invisibly on pages or screens.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to share aggregated site statistics monitored by cookies and web beacons with our affiliates and partner companies. We treat the information of everyone who comes to our Services in accordance with this Privacy Policy, whatever their Do Not Track setting.</p>

<h3>Geolocation Data</h3>
<p>We do not collect precise information (e.g., GPS data; latitude and longitude) concerning the location from which you access the Services, but we collect information on your region or postal code to help us gather information useful for improving the relevance of our content and securing our Services.</p>

<h2>Third Party Advertising</h2>
<p>We may allow third party advertising companies to serve ads when you access or use our Services. These companies use non-personally identifiable information regarding your access and use of our Services and other websites, such as the user IP address, pages viewed, date and time of your visit, and number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), to serve ads to you on our Services and other websites that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to our Services, our third party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. In addition, we may use clear GIFs or pixel tags to help manage our online advertising. These clear GIFs enable our ad serving company to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits our Services. This allows us to learn which banner ads bring users to our Services.</p>

<h2>Information Collected through the Portal</h2>
<p>As a service to its customers, we may also provide Portals to offer some customers secure, private access to their own records at our facilities, as well as certain internet-based services which may include, among other things, assistance in finding a doctor, assistance in scheduling appointments, the ability to register for classes and pre-register for procedures, the ability to make payment for medical services rendered, and access to health and patient education materials and secure messaging (&ldquo;Portal&rdquo;).</p>

<p>The Portal can provide you with access to some of your medical records. When you seek access to those records on the Portal, we need to confirm it is you so we ask you for information such as your name and email or physical address and other information such as your date of birth (which we may also use to make sure you are eligible to use the Portal in accordance with the Terms) and the answers to &ldquo;secret questions&rdquo; to which only you know the answers. This information may be used to help administer your user account and in managing your account. We may need to ask you for the information again when you sign in from a new device.</p>

<p>We may ask for information about your location and medical needs to assist with finding a physician, and may collect and pass on information (which may include, where relevant, health information such as your patient history) to assist you in scheduling appointments, pre-registering for procedures, and registering for classes.</p>

<h2>The Purposes for Which We Use Personal Information</h2>
<p>If you submit or we collect Personal Information through our Services, then such Personal Information may be used in the following ways: (i) to provide, analyze, administer, and improve our Services; (ii) to contact you in connection with our Services and appointments, events or offerings that you may have registered for; (iii) to identify and authenticate your access to the parts of our Portal or other password-protected Services that you are authorized to access; (iv) to send you surveys; (v) for recruiting and human resources administration purposes; (vi) to protect our rights or our property and to ensure the technical functionality and security of our Services; and (vii) as required to meet our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

<p>If you are a visitor from the European Economic Area, our legal basis for collecting and using the information described in this Privacy Policy will depend on the information concerned and the context in which we collect it.  We collect information from you:</p>
<ul>
	<li>where we need it to perform our contract with you (i.e., our Terms);</li>
	<li>where the processing is in our legitimate interests (provided that these aren’t overridden by your interests or rights)(such as securing and improving our Services, for example);</li>
	<li>where the processing is for the provision of healthcare or the management of healthcare services (e.g., health information collected from you or made accessible to you through the Portal in accordance with legal requirements governing the confidentiality of such information); or</li>
	<li>if we otherwise have your consent.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use your information, please contact us using the contact details provided under the &ldquo;Contact Us&rdquo; section below.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Our Third Party Providers</strong>. We transfer Personal Information to third party service providers to perform tasks on our behalf and to assist us in providing our Services.  For example, we may use third party service providers for security, website analytics, and payment processing.  We use commercially reasonable efforts to only engage or interact with third party service providers and partners that post a privacy policy governing their processing of Personal Information, and require our service providers to maintain confidentiality and comply with applicable laws in the processing of Personal Information.  A list of our <a href="/legal/index.dot#appendix-to-hca-privacy-policy-list-of-service-providers" target="_blank">current third party service providers is available here</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Change of Control</strong>. We may transfer or assign Personal Information to a third party entity that acquires or is merged with us as part of a merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</li>
	<li><strong>Other Disclosures</strong>.

</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Authorized Representatives</strong>. If another individual is managing your account on your behalf (for example, a mother managing the account of her son), as authorized by you or as a personal representative under applicable law, that person can view all Personal Information about you in the Portal.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Information Security</h3>
<p>No website can guarantee security, but we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information collected via our Services in compliance with applicable law. Please see the Terms of Use available via the Website homepage (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) for more specific information about information security and your responsibilities.</p>

<h3>What Can I Do to Protect My Privacy?</h3>
<p>Where you use a Portal or other service that is secured with a username and password, you are also responsible for taking steps to protect the privacy of Personal Information about you.  In order to protect your privacy, you should:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Never share your username or password.</li>
	<li>Always sign out when you are finished using the Portal.</li>

We have no responsibility concerning any breach of your confidential medical record information due to your sharing or losing your user name or password.</p>

<h3>Retention of Information</h3>
<p>We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it has been collected as described in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required by law (e.g., laws mandating retention of medical records for a certain period of time).</p>

For example, we dispose of web server logs after 90 days, information submitted through secure forms after 6 months, access and activity logs relating to the Portal after 1 year, and information collected for analytics purposes on the Website (e.g., information on pages visited on the Website) after 2 years.</p>

<h3>Third Party Websites and Payments</h3>
<p>If you use the Portal to link to another third party website, you may decide to disclose personal information at that website. Please be aware that in contacting that third party website, or in providing information on that website, that third party may obtain personal information about you. This Privacy Policy does not apply when you leave the Portal and go to a third party website from the Portal. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Portal and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.</p>

<p>Any payments you may make for services you have found on the Portal (such as enrolling in a class) are made exclusively through an affiliated third party website the separate privacy policy of which applies, and not through the Portal. We are not responsible for any fees, charges, or actions provided by such a third party website.</p>

<h3>User Communications</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Email communications that you send to us via the email links on our Services may be shared with a customer service representative, employee, medical expert or agent that is most able to address your inquiry.

Once we have responded to your communication, it is discarded or archived, depending on the nature of the inquiry.</li>
	<li>The email functionality on our Services does not provide a completely secure and confidential means of communication. It is possible that your email communication may be accessed or viewed by another Internet user while in transit to us. If you wish to keep your communication private, do not use our email.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Social Media Policy</h2>

<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The information and advice published or made available through this web site is not intended to replace the services of a physician, nor does it constitute a doctor-patient relationship. Information on this web site is provided for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice.</p>

<h3>Comment Policy</h3>

<p>We encourage your comments on HCA Healthcare's various blogs, and hope you will join the discussions. We can't respond to every comment, particularly those that deal with individual medical cases and issues. We review comments before they're posted, and those that are off-topic or clearly promoting a commercial product generally won't make the cut. We also expect a basic level of civility; disagreements are fine, but mutual respect is a must, and profanity or abusive language are out-of-bounds.</p>

<p><strong>That's the plain English version. Here it is in legal language:</strong></p>

<p>By posting any comments, posts or other material on HCA Healthcare-sponsored blogs, you give HCA Healthcare ("HCA Healthcare") the irrevocable right to reproduce, distribute, publish, display, edit, modify, create derivative works from, and otherwise use your submission for any purpose in any form and on any media. You also agree that you will not:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Post material that infringes on the rights of any third party, including intellectual property, privacy or publicity rights.</li>
	<li>Post material that is unlawful, obscene, defamatory, threatening, harassing, abusive, slanderous, hateful, or embarrassing to any other person or entity as determined by HCA Healthcare in its sole discretion.</li>
	<li>Post advertisements or solicitations of business.</li>
	<li>Post chain letters or pyramid schemes.</li>
	<li>Impersonate another person.</li>
	<li>Allow any other person or entity to use your identification for posting or viewing comments.</li>
	<li>Post the same note more than once or "spam."</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>HCA Healthcare reserves the right (but is not obligated) to do any or all of the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Remove communications that are abusive, illegal or disruptive, or that otherwise fail to conform with these Terms and Conditions.</li>
	<li>Terminate a user's access to the blog feature upon any breach of these Terms and Conditions.</li>
	<li>Edit or delete any communications posted on the blog feature, regardless of whether such communications violate these standards.</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, you agree that you will indemnify HCA Healthcare against any damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs) arising out of a claim by a third party relating to any material you have posted.</p>
