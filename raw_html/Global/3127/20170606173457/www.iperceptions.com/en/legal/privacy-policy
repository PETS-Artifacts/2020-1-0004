The survey responses are owned and managed by the Customer. The Customer is responsible for the survey data. If you have any question, you may contact the Customer directly as iPerceptions is not responsible for the content of the survey you have responded to or your responses to it. Customers may have their own privacy policies that detail how said Customers handle your personal information or other information. iPerceptions encourages you to read carefully any such policy and learn about the privacy practices of those third parties. As between you and iPerceptions, your submission of personal information is voluntary and optional. You may opt out of responding at any time. However, if you do respond, you consent to its provision to iPerceptions for the purpose of delivering the Services to our Customer.</span></p>
<p><strong>3.3. Automatically Collected Information</strong><br><span>iPerceptions gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, the IP addresses of Respondents, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), mobile carrier, mobile device, operating system, referring/exit pages, the URLs of sites from which a User arrives or leaves a website, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. iPerceptions uses this information to analyze trends, to monitor the effectiveness of marketing efforts, including which websites refer the most people to iPerceptions, to deliver iPerceptions or third party advertising to Users, to administer the Website, to understand users’ movements around the Website, and to improve the quality of the Services and Website performance, to aid solving technical problems, and to gather demographic information about iPerceptions’ User base as a whole (The IP addresses are analyzed in the aggregate). We do not link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you, except where you have chosen to provide it. iPerceptions uses Cookies and other technologies to help personalize and improve the User’s online experience and the overall quality of the Services. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer or device. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. iPerceptions may use a third-party tracking service that uses images, scripts, page tags (also known as web beacons) and other tracking technologies to track non-personal information about visitors to our Website in the aggregate. This data includes user statistics. iPerceptions will not request, access or otherwise track any location based information from your mobile device.

If you are a customer of one of our Customers and would no longer like to be contacted by one of our Customers that use the Services, please contact the Customer that you interact with directly. Because iPerceptions is acting as the Customer’s agent, if you choose to opt-out of future emails, the opt-out will be Customer-specific, and does not apply to other emails sent by iPerceptions. Information collected in response to an email is handled in the same manner as other website visitor data, as described in this Privacy Statement. iPerceptions may transfer personal information to companies that help iPerceptions provide the Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by this Privacy Policy and the service agreements with our Customers. In certain instances, iPerceptions’ surveys include sweepstakes incentives.
