<div class="articleparagraph section">





<p><h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Protecting privacy and maintaining the trust of our customers, their students, and parents has always been a key priority for us. To enhance learning, we need access to data, measurement, insight and other feedback that inform us 

about students' knowledge and skill levels and learning development.

</p><ul style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>Our goal is to use data in the course of current learning activities to provide adaptive pathways of learning; not drive commerce.</li>
<li>We want to communicate with parents and schools about the educational benefit of using technology to create a personalized learning path based on past performance, and the need to use student information for educational 

purposes.</li>
<li>We want to build trust about the way we use personally identifiable student data for educational purposes.</li>
</ul>

<p>And our commitment to privacy and innovation goes beyond compliance, it's part of our culture:

</p><ul style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>We have implemented policies and procedures around these issues to support schools and institutions in their COPPA and FERPA compliance efforts.</li>

<p></p><li>In 2013, we appointed one of the education industry's first Chief Privacy Officers.</li>

<p></p><li>We've taken a leadership role with Future of Privacy Forum (FPF) and the Software and Information Industry Association (SIIA) in setting the agenda for self-regulatory goals for student privacy in the industry.</li>

<p></p><li>We have an internal Privacy Council comprised of senior leaders throughout our company insuring best practices across our business.</li>

<p></p><li>We do not support business models that create tolls and taxes on interoperability.</li>

<p></p><li>We conduct regular scans of all of our applications to prevent and detect any possible security breaches. We recognize that no system is 100% secure, but do everything we can to prevent and mitigate any impact of adverse 

events.</li>
</ul>

<p>By increasing awareness and transparency, we hope to better understand the concerns and learn how to talk with each other about privacy, security, and confidentiality.

</p><p>Educational institutions are ultimately responsible for providing a full understanding of the privacy practices around how their students' personally identifiable information is collected, shared, and used. To obtain more detailed 

information about how data is collected, used, and shared by an educational institution, please contact the appropriate individual at that institution.

<p><b><i>What is personally identifiable information (PII)?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>Personally Identifiable Information, or PII, is information that can identify you, or when combined with other information can be used to identify you.</i></b>

</p><p>Personally identifiable information, or PII, is information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, address, or ID numbers. PII also includes information that can be combined to identify you, such as you date of birth and 

birthplace. Any information that is combined with PII, is also considered PII as long as it is linked to PII. For example, we couldn't identify you based on your grade level, however grade level is PII as long as it is connected to you.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">





<p><b><i>What PII do we collect and how do we use it?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>We collect PII, such as contact information and education details, in order to provide, maintain and improve our products and services.</i></b>

</p><p>We only collect the information we require to provide, maintain and improve the digital learning solution you and your child use. When you and/or your child register, or are registered within one of our digital learning solutions, we 

typically only collect your name, school, instructor, class, and login information. However, once you begin using one of our solutions, we collect your input to questions, technical specifications, and other information about how you use 

the solution. As mentioned above, we use this information to provide you and your child with the solution, as well as maintain and improve the solution.

</p><p>We will not sell your PII to other organizations, nor will we send you advertisements using the information we collect while you use the solution. In addition, we will not share this information with any third party unless they are 

assisting us with providing, maintaining or improving the solution. If we do share your information, we only share it with those organizations that can commit to the same levels of privacy and security that we do.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">






<p><b><i>When do we share your PII with third parties?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>In general, we only share your PII in order to provide, maintain, or improve our products or services, or respond to legal requests.</i></b>

</p><p></p><ol style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>o-branded/Other Web Sites and Features â€“ We may share your PII with third-party business partners for the purpose of providing the Service to you. Those business partners will be given limited access to the PII that is reasonably 

necessary to deliver the Service, and we will require that such third parties follow the same privacy and security practices as McGraw-Hill Education.</li>

<p></p><li>Business Transfer â€“ In the event of a sale, merger or acquisition, we may transfer your PII to a separate entity. This entity will be responsible for ensuring that your PII is used only for authorized purposes and by authorized 

persons in a manner consistent with the choices customers and prospects have made under this Policy, and that security, integrity and privacy of the information is maintained.</li>

<p></p><li>Agents/Service providers â€“ Sometimes we hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions for us. In certain instances, we provide these companies with access to your PII in order for them to perform their 

functions. However, we limit that access to only information required to perform their specific function, and we contractually require that these organizations follow the same privacy and security requirements.</li>

<p></p><li>Affiliates â€“ McGraw-Hill Education is a global corporation that consists of multiple organizations. In some instances, we may share your PII between organizations within McGraw-Hill Education to provide, maintain, and improve our 

products and services.</li>

<p></p><li>Customers â€“ As we are a service provider to your school, we may share your date with approved individuals at your school, such as administrators or educators</li>

<p></p><li>Law Enforcement â€“ In the event that McGraw-Hill Education receives a legal demand for customer data from a law enforcement agency that requests will only be honored if:</li>

<p></p><ol type="a">
<li>The request complies with all laws and clearly establishes the legal need for disclosure.</li>
<li>The request is related to a specific investigation and specific user accounts are implicated in that investigation.</li>
<li>Whenever legally permissible, users shall receive notice that their information is being requested.</li>
</ol>
</ol>




<hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">





<p><b><i>What privacy controls and choices do we offer you?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>You may contact customer service to review or correct your PII.</i></b>

</p><p></p><ol style="font-size: 1.8rem;">
<li>Reviewing &amp; correcting your information â€“ We strive to ensure that the PII we have about you is accurate and current. However, since McGraw-Hill Education is a service provider to your school, please contact the appropriate contact 

at your school if you want to review your account information, or believe that the PII we have about you is inaccurate.</li>

<p></p><li>Consent â€“ As noted above, your educational institution is ultimately responsible for the privacy of your PII. MHE obtains consent from your institution to collect, process, and store your PII. If you have any questions regarding 

the collection and use of your PII, please contact the appropriate individual at your educational institution.</li>
</ol>

</i></b></p><p><b><i>Our IT security team has established reasonable security measures to protect your PII.</i></b>

</p><p>We use reasonable security measures to protect your PII from unauthorized access and use.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">





<p><b><i>Can you delete your PII?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>You may request that we delete your PII through your school, however you should be aware this may limit your ability to use our products or services.</i></b>

</p><p>We can delete your information at the request of your school. Since your school has hired us to manage this information for them, we ask that you or your parent make any request directly to your school. Please know that if we do 

receive a request to delete your information, you may no longer be able to access or use the digital learning solution.




</p><hr style="border-top:1px solid #636363;">






<p><b><i>When do we store, transfer or process PII internationally?

</i></b></p><p><b><i>McGraw-Hill Education is a global organization based in the U.S. Depending on your location, we may transfer and store your PII for processing in the U.S.</i></b>
