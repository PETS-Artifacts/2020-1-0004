        <h2>4. ACCURACY & SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
            Any personal Information you provide to Company is kept on secure servers with limited access. The Company uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures (a) to safeguard personal Information against loss, theft, unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification; and (b) to ensure the integrity of the personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, as effective as our security measures are, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any Information you include in a posting to the discussion areas is available to anyone with Internet access.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit or use our website, mobile application or services. These companies may use Information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits or use to particular website, mobile application or services, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

        <p>
            Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some Information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services and such Information is outside the Company’s control.

        <h2>5. TRANSFER OF PERSONAL INFORMATION TO OTHER COUNTRIES</h2>
        <p>
            Some of the uses and disclosures mentioned in this Privacy Policy may involve the transfer and processing of your personal Information to and in various countries around the world that may have different levels of privacy protection than your country. By submitting your personal Information, you consent to such transfers and processing, including to and in the United States.

        <h2>6. ACCESS AND UPDATING PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
        <p>
            When you use the Services, website (or any of its sub sites) or any app, we make good faith efforts to provide you, as and when requested by you, with access to your personal Information and shall further ensure that any personal Information or sensitive personal data or information found to be inaccurate or deficient shall be corrected or amended as feasible, subject to any requirement for such personal Information or sensitive personal data or Information to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the Information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case, where we provide Information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete your Information, residual copies may take a period of time before they are deleted from our active servers and may remain in our backup systems.

        <h3>1. What is a Cookie?</h3>
        <p>
            A cookie is a piece of software code that an internet website sends to your browser when you access information at that site. A cookie is stored as a simple text file on your computer or mobile device by a website’s server and only that server will be able to retrieve or read the contents of that cookie. Cookies let you navigate between pages efficiently as they store your preferences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, cookies do not contain personal information from which you can be identified, unless you have furnished such information to the website.   This Website uses cookies to track usage and help improve features and Services. This information helps us monitor traffic on our website so that we can manage the Website’s capacity and efficiency. It also helps us to understand which parts of this Website are most popular, and generally to assess user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the Website.
        </p>

        <h3>2. About this Cookie Policy</h3>
        <p>
            This Cookie Policy forms part of and is incorporated into our Website Terms and Conditions.  
        </p>
        <p>

        <h3>3. How we use Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            We collect information on our users through registration and the use of the Website, through cookies, where you choose to disclose data in postings, and when you enter sales promotion and competitions.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use cookies for a number of reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
            (i) To gather statistics. We track how many ‘unique users’ we have and how often they visit our websites. We track how often different pages of our Website are visited and which countries our visitors come from. Accurate statistics enable us to sell advertising and continue to provide a top quality service to you.  The information collected by cookies does not personally identify you; it includes general information about your computer settings, your connection to the Internet e.g. operating system and platform, IP address, your browsing patterns and timings of browsing on the Website and your location.
        </p>
        <p>
            (ii) To track advertising response.  Third parties through generate statistical cookies to track ad impressions and click-through rates.  Some cookies enable us to show the adverts that might be more relevant to you, to control the number of times you see them, and measure how effective the ad campaign has been.
        </p>
        <p>
            (iii) We also utilise cookies to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our advertisements on sites across the Internet. In addition, third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies together to inform, optimise, and serve advertisements based on someone’s past visits to our website.
        </p>
        <p>
            (iv) Flash cookies may be used to store user preferences for media player functionality and without them some video content may not render correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            By using the sites you are agreeing to the use of cookies as described.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="story__element__text">
        <h3>4. Types of cookie that may be used</h3>
        <p>
            The following types of cookie are used on this site. We don't list every single cookie used by name - but for each type of cookie we tell you how you can control its use.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="story__element__text">
        <h3><u>A. First Party Cookies</u></h3>
        <p>
            These are our own cookies, controlled by us and used to provide information about usage of our site.
        </p>
        <p>
            (i) Personalisation cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            These cookies are used to recognise repeat visitors to the Website and in conjunction with other information we hold to attempt to record specific browsing information (that is, about the way you arrive at the Website, pages you view, options you select, information you enter and the path you take through the Website). These are used to recommend content we think you'll be interested in based on what you're looked at before.
        </p>
        <p>
            (ii) Analytics cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            These monitor how visitors move around the Website and how they reached it. This is used so that we can see total (not individual) figures on which types of content users enjoy most, for instance.
        </p>
        <p>
            (iii) Our own ad serving and management cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            We sell space on some of our websites to advertisers.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of this, we use several services to help us and advertisers understand what adverts you might be interested in. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (i.e.  it is not linked to you as an individual). But they might hold a record of what other websites you've looked at - so we could show you an advert if you've previously visited a motoring website.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are the services we use and how you can control those cookies. Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            (iv) Site management cookies
        </p>
        <p>
            These are used to maintain your identity or session on the Website. For instance, where our websites run on more than one server, we use a cookie to ensure that you are sent information by one specific server (otherwise you may log in or out unexpectedly). We may use similar cookies when you vote in opinion polls to ensure that you can only vote once, and to ensure that you can use our commenting functionality when not logged in (to ensure you don't see comments you've reported as abusive, for instance, or don't vote comments up/down more than once).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="story__element__text">
        <h3><u>B. Third Party Cookies</u></h3>
        <p>
            These are cookies found in other companies’ internet tools which we are using to enhance our Website, for example Facebook or Twitter, have their own cookies, which are controlled by them.  The companies that generate these cookies have their own privacy policies and the Company has no access to read or write these cookies, other than allowing them to be served, we have no role to play in these cookies at all
        </p>
        <p> (i) Third-party service cookies</p>
        <p>
            Social sharing, video and other services we offer are run by other companies. These companies may drop cookies on your computer when you use them on our Website or if you are already logged in to them.
        </p>
        <p> (ii) Other ad management cookies</p>
        <p>
            Advertisements on the Website are provided by other organisations. Our advertising partners will serve advertisements that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you, based on information about your visit to the Website and other websites. In order to do this, our advertising partner may need to place a cookie on your computer. These cookies hold information about the computer - they don't hold personal information about you (ie it's not linked to you as an individual).
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that turning off advertising cookies won't mean that you are not served any advertising merely that it will not be tailored to your interests.
        </p>
        <p>
            These cookies cannot be turned off individually but you could change your browser setting to refuse all cookies (see above) if you do not wish to accept them.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="story__element__text">
        <h3>5. Turning off Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            Most browsers allow you to turn off cookies. If you want to know how to do this please look up the help menu on your browser. However, switching off cookies may restrict your use of the Website and/or affect the way in which the Website operates. Also, if you do this you may not be able to use all Services on our Website and you might see more pop-ups and other intrusive advertising, as we won’t be able to limit what you see using cookies. You will, however, still be able to view editorial content.
        </p>
        <p>
            All modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details.
