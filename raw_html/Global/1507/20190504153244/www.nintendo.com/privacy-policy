We also use this information to provide you with services that you request, develop new services, suggest personally relevant features, offer you customized content, provide you with tailored advertising, protect Nintendo and our users, and investigate and prevent activities that are potentially illegal or that violate our user agreements or terms of use.</p>

				<p id="cookies">We may use cookies, or other similar technologies, on some of the features of our services. Cookies are small files that are typically downloaded to the browser application on your device. Cookies help us to ensure the safety and smooth functioning of certain features of our services and they also help us to collect information about your user preferences.

You may be able to disable cookies in your browser settings or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being used. If you disable cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of our services. Some web browsers may transmit "do not track" signals. We currently do not take action in response to these signals.</p>
				<p>Analytics providers are third-party companies that collect information when you use some of our services.

				<p><a data-href="//www.nintendo.com/analytics-providers" href="/analytics-providers" rel="nofollow">https://www.nintendo.com/analytics-providers</a></p>
				<p>We also may permit our third-party partners to set cookies and use web beacons, SDKs, and similar technologies within our services to help us perform various internal functions necessary to operate our business and to collect information about your use of our and others’ services across your devices.  These third parties may use that information to provide you advertisements, across the Internet and mobile applications and devices, about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of these third parties may offer you a way to opt-out of this type of targeted advertising through industry choice mechanisms. To learn more about third parties that participate in these choice offerings and to exercise choices that may be available to you, you can visit <a data-href="//www.networkadvertising.org/" href="//www.networkadvertising.org/" rel="nofollow">www.networkadvertising.org</a> and <a data-href="//www.aboutads.info/" href="//www.aboutads.info/" rel="nofollow">www.aboutads.info</a>.

			</li>
			<li>
				<h3>How your information is shared</h3>

We may also share your information for other legal and business purposes, such as complying with legal process, responding to claims or inquiries, enforcing our terms, or protecting the rights, property or personal safety of our operations, our users, or the public. Your information may also be shared as part of any sale or transfer of company assets, if legally permitted.</p>
				<p>If you choose to connect with a third-party service through our services, we may share your information with that service and that service may share your information with us.

				<h3>Information security</h3>
