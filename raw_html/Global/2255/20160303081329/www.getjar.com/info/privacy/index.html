	<p><strong>Updated: May 9, 2014</strong></p>
	<p>
		This GetJar privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") is intended to inform you of GetJar Baltic JSC's ("we," "us," or "our") policies 
		and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your Personal Information through the GetJar Site and 
		GetJar Services. We define Personal Information as information that allows someone to identify or contact you, 
		including for example your name, address, telephone number, and email address.
	</p>
	<p>
		By registering with us or using our website, you expressly consent to the information handling practices in this privacy 
		policy. If you reside outside the United States, you understand that your personal information may be processed in 
		countries (including the United States) where laws regarding processing personal information may be less stringent 
		than in your country.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Privacy Policy is a part of our <a href="/info/terms/" class="link dInline">Terms of Use</a>. 
		If any term of this Privacy Policy is inconsistent or conflicts with any term of 
		the Terms of Use, this Privacy Policy will control. Capitalized terms used in this Privacy Policy but not defined in this 
		Privacy Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.
	</p>

	<h2>Personal Information You Provide to us</h2>
	<p>
		When you register to use GetJar Services, we may collect your name, e-mail address and e-mail preferences, and password for 
		your account. We may also ask you to provide additional information on an optional basis in connection with setting up your account. 
		You may also register by using your log-in credentials from social networking websites, including Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.  
		When you register in this way, we may collect Personal Information from the social networking websites that you have given us 
		permission to collect or made publicly available. The information GetJar obtains may depend on your privacy settings with the 
		social networking website. When you purchase any Materials or services from the GetJar Site, we may collect your name, phone number, 
		e-mail address, mailing address, billing address, complete credit card information that enables us to receive your payment (however 
		we do not retain your credit card number unless requested) and federal tax identification number or European Union VAT number as 
		applicable. When you give us feedback, we may collect any information that is contained in your feedback. When you contact us by 
		sending us an e-mail, fax, or letter, we collect your e-mail address, fax number, or mailing address, and any information contained 
		in the e-mail, fax, or letter you send us.
	</p>

	<h2>Personal Information Collected via Technology</h2>
	<p>
		As you use the GetJar Site or any GetJar Service, some information may also be collected passively, including your Internet protocol 
		address, browser type, access time, mobile phone model, and telecom carrier. We may also store a small text file called a "Cookie" 
		on your computer or phone to store certain information about your use of the GetJar Site or GetJar Services. We may use both session 
		Cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer or phone until you delete them). 
		We may collect and store information locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage and application data caches.
	</p>
	<p>
		So that GetJar can provide services, such as version upgrades and app recommendations, we may passively collect information that 
		identifies your mobile device, such as the International Mobile Equipment Identity, IP address, and Android ID. 
		GetJar may also automatically collect data about apps you have installed and the frequency of their use. We may collect details 
		of how you used the GetJar Services, such as your browsing behaviors and search queries.
	</p>

	<h2>Use of Information</h2>
	<p>
		We use your Personal Information to provide the GetJar Services to you, to respond to requests that you make, to 
		personalize your online experience on the GetJar Site, to improve the GetJar Site and GetJar Services, and to better 
		tailor the features, performance, and support of the GetJar Services.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may use your Personal Information to send you electronic newsletters or promotional e-mails, unless you have requested not to 
		receive such promotional communications from us. We may also use your Personal Information to send you GetJar Services-related 
		communications, and you may opt out of these communications if you terminate your account.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information. We reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information 
		at our discretion. "Anonymous Information" means information that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Information.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any feedback you provide will be governed by the Terms of Use.
	</p>

	<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information</h2>

		We may provide your Personal Information to specified third parties for sending you promotional e-mails relating to such third 
		parties' products, unless you have requested us not to receive promotional communications from such third parties.
	</p>
	<p>
		We may provide your Personal Information to third party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide the GetJar 
		Site and GetJar Services. However, these service providers do not have any independent right to share this information 
		(except pursuant to a legal requirement such as a subpoena or warrant).
	</p>
	<p>
		We may provide your credit card and related billing and payment information to third party service providers engaged on GetJar's 
		behalf, including payment processors and/or credit agencies, for the purposes of checking credit, effecting payment, and servicing

		collected by us and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information, as described in this Privacy Policy.
	</p>

	<h2>Law Enforcement Compliance</h2>
	<p>
		We may be required by law, or by law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, to record some or all of your communications 
		on or through the GetJar Site or GetJar Services. We may, and you hereby authorize us to, disclose your Personal Information 
		(including your account information) and your communications through the GetJar Site and GetJar Services, if required by law or by 
		law enforcement officers acting under the color of law, or if we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to: 
		(1) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or 
		(2) to protect and defend ours, our Affiliates,' other users,' or your, rights, property or safety.
	</p>

		You may change your email address and password for the Service by editing it in your account page. You may request deletion of your 
		Personal Information by us, but please note that we may be required (by law or otherwise) to keep this information and not delete it
