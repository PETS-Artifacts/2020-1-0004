<h1 class="underline"><strong>PRIVACY</strong> STATEMENT</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Welcome to the National Association of Insurance   Commissioners ("NAIC") Web Site. Because your privacy on-line is very   important to us, we want you to understand the NAIC&rsquo;s practices with   regard to collecting and using your information. This privacy statement   explains the privacy practices for the following NAIC Web Sites: <a href="http://www.naic.org" target="_blank">www.naic.org,</a> <a href="http://www.insureuonline.org">www.insureuonline.org,</a> <a href="http://www.statebasedsystems.com" target="_blank">www.statebasedsystems.com,</a> <a href="http://www.optins.org" target="_blank">www.optins.org</a> and <a href="http://www.serff.com" target="_blank">www.serff.com</a>.   The NAIC&rsquo;s Privacy Statement is not intended to supercede or modify the   terms of any license agreement between NAIC and a third party and where   inconsistent, the terms of the license agreement control.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information<br>
</em></strong>You do not need to reveal any personally identifiable information to browse the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Customer Information<br>
</em></strong>If you order an NAIC product or register for an   education or training course or a meeting online, the NAIC collects your   name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, company name, and   company size. The NAIC collects this information for purposes of   fulfilling orders for products, registering for courses and NAIC   meetings, and billing. The NAIC may also use this information to create   general mailing lists to send customers marketing and other promotional   material. The NAIC also collects credit card information if you are   making an online purchase. The NAIC uses this information for billing   purposes only.</p>
<p align="left">If you subscribe or utilize an NAIC online service   including the I-SITE System (accessible only by State Insurance   Departments); the Automated Valuation System; the ATF and the System for   Electronic Rate and Form Filing, the NAIC collects your name, address,   telephone number, facsimile number, and e-mail address. The NAIC   collects this information for the following purposes: problem   resolution, security/authentication, aggregate usage reports. The NAIC   may also use this information to create general mailing lists to send   user notices as well as marketing and other relevant information to   customers.</p>
<p align="left">The NAIC collects and stores the Internet protocol   (the IP address) of the computer you are using, and the date and time   you accessed the NAIC site. The NAIC also tracks the pages or documents   accessed within its site. This information is collected for systems   administration and for analyzing and improving the value of the material   available on the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
<p align="left">The main NAIC Web Site is portal based and relies   upon "cookies" to tailor the information delivered to the user. Cookies   are small web-generated files that are stored on your computer hard   drive in order to collect information about your activities on a   particular web site. The NAIC utilizes cookies to monitor security,   navigation and usage of the NAIC Web Sites.</p>
<p align="left">The NAIC uses information collected over the   Internet to process your requests, communicate back to you and improve   our web sites. The NAIC may share the information mentioned above with   its non-profit affiliate the National Insurance Producer Registry   ("NIPR") for these purposes. The NAIC does not provide customer   information collected over the Internet to third parties other than in   aggregated form.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Google Analytics</em></strong><br>
  The NAIC uses a tool called &ldquo;Google Analytics&rdquo; to collect   information about use of this site. Google Analytics collects   information such as how often users visit this site, what pages they   visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to   this site. The NAIC uses the information  from Google Analytics only to   improve this site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address   assigned to you on the date you visit this site, rather than your name   or other identifying information. The NAIC does not combine the   information collected through the use of Google Analytics with   personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a   permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user   the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone   but Google. Google&rsquo;s ability to use and share information collected by   Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html" target="_blank">Google Analytics Terms of Use</a> and the <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy.</a> You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by <a href="http://www.usa.gov/optout-instructions.shtml" target="_blank">disabling cookies</a> on your browser.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Information Submitted in an Online Application<br>
</em></strong>Certain NAIC online applications collect information for   purposes of transmitting the information to state insurance departments   (e.g., SERFF) and/or processing the information for the user (e.g.   AVS). These online applications require the user to enter into a license   agreement with the NAIC. The license agreement governs the collection,   use and disclosure of information while in these applications and where   the terms of this Privacy Statement are inconsistent, the license   agreement supercedes.</p>
<p align="left">Insurance companies electronically file annual and   quarterly statements as well as other filing information with the NAIC.   The NAIC compiles this information into a proprietary database for   purposes of assisting its members, state insurance regulators, in   carrying out their respective regulatory functions. The NAIC also sells   non-confidential information from this proprietary database to customers   subject to a license agreement.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Security of Information<br>
</em></strong>The NAIC views security of confidential and private   information as a top priority. The NAIC provides secure transmission of   sensitive and personal information from your computers to the NAIC&rsquo;s Web   Servers. For instance, when credit card information is transmitted, the   NAIC uses the industry standard SSL (security socket layer) encryption.   SSL encryption is a state-of-the-art technology by which information is   encrypted while being transmitted over the Internet. Unfortunately, no   data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely   secure and the NAIC does not ensure or warrant the security of the   transmission of information. Once the information is received by the   NAIC via the web site, it is stored behind a firewall. The NAIC also   maintains access control procedures. All NAIC and NIPR employees are   aware of the privacy and security policies. Your information is only   accessible to those employees who have a legitimate need for the   information in order to perform their jobs.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Correction and Opt-Out Procedures<br>
</em></strong>If your personally identifiable customer information   changes, we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data   provided to us. Please visit the <a href="http://www.naic.org/index_contact.htm">NAIC Contacts Web page</a> to find the contact information or send your request for change to the Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@naic.org">help@naic.org</a>.   If you no longer wish to receive NAIC newsletters, promotional   materials or other electronic communications, you may opt-out by   replying to the NAIC e-mail and inserting the term "unsubscribe" in the   subject line or by sending an e-mail to the Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@naic.org">help@naic.org</a></p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Links to Other Web Sites<br>
</em></strong>The NAIC provides links to third-party web sites as a   convenience to its users. The inclusion of any link does not imply an   endorsement or recommendation of the third-party organization, its web   site, or its products and services. The NAIC has not reviewed and is not   responsible for the privacy practices or content of such web sites.</p>
<p align="left"><strong><em>Notification of Change<br>
</em></strong>The NAIC reserves the right to change its privacy policy.   The most current privacy policy will be posted on the NAIC Web Sites so   you are always aware of what information the NAIC collects, how it is   used, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed. If at any   point the NAIC decides to use personally identifiable information in a   manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, the NAIC   will notify users by way of an e-mail. The NAIC will provide a method   for a user to opt-out of using their information in this different   manner.</p>
