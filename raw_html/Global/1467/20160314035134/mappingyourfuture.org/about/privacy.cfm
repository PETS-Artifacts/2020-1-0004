 <li><strong>What information does Mapping Your Future collect about you?</strong>
  <p>Mapping Your Future gathers information from you in order to help us design our website to better meet your needs and to make the financial aid process easier for you. Mapping Your Future does not share your personally identifying information with third-party marketers. We gather and retain information in the following ways:<br />

    <br />
    When you view the Mapping Your Future site, we identify which browser you're using, where you linked from and to, and which part of the site you viewed.

   <p>We use cookies to keep track of sessions in specific secured areas of the site. Mapping Your Future does not store any personally identifying information in cookies. Recording a cookie makes your online experience easier and more personalized. Mapping Your Future only creates cookies for each session, and those cookies are cleared when your Mapping Your Future session terminates. If you set your browser to reject or prevent cookies, you may limit the functionality we can provide when you visit our site.</p>
   <p> <strong>When you're submitting a question or comment to Mapping Your Future:</strong><br />
    <br />
    When you submit a question or comment to Mapping Your Future, the information is available to Mapping Your Future professional staff and sponsors.

This information may be shared with your school, lender, and/or guarantor to verify that you have completed counseling, though for a limited period of time. Those entities may share your information with other organizations as authorized under routine uses in the appropriate system of records and as may be authorized or required by federal regulations. </p>
   <p>If you do not wish to provide this information online, you must contact your school to request an alternative method of fulfilling your counseling obligation.</p>
