<p>The purpose of data protection is to protect personal data. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (&quot;data subject&quot;). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular, by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p>
<p>This information includes, for example, details such as name and email address, but also nicknames and information in your forum posts.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-purpose">What is the purpose of data processing and what is the legal basis?</h3>
<h4 id="purpose">Purpose of data collection and processing</h4>
<p>In compliance with Art. 5 (b) <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, we collect and process your personal data for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and do not further process your data in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.</p>
<p>We collect and process your personal data solely for the following purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li>We collect and process your personal data, such as website logs and data relating to subscription downloads, extension update checks (such data is collected and processed by Google, see <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>), emergency notifications and Issue Reporter data sent by you, for technical purposes. We mainly collect and process such data to prevent security attacks and are thus able to provide our services to you in a secure and data-efficient manner.</li>
<li>We collect and process your personal data relating to subscription downloads, extension updates, emergency downloads, and Issue Reporter data sent to us by you to improve and evaluate our products.</li>
<li>We send emergency notifications in order to inform you about urgent issues in connection with our products.</li>
<li>We collect and process the data you have provided us with in our blog and forum in order to communicate with you and / or to assist you.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="legal-basis">Legal basis of data collection and processing</h4>
<p>We collect and process your personal data in compliance with the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and the applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws and German national data protection laws.</p>
<h4 id="consent-permission">Collection and processing is based on your consent - Art. 6 (1) a <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>, Art. 4 (11) <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>We will always ask for your consent to collect and process your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, unless the collection and processing of your personal data is permitted by statutory laws. Where you have provided us with your consent to the collection and processing of your personal data for the aforementioned specific purposes, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
<h4 id="contract-permission">Collection and processing is necessary for taking steps prior to enter into a contract - Art. 6 (1) b <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>
<p>The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the performance of a contract to which you may be a party. Prior to entering into such a contract, the collection and processing of your personal data may also be necessary in order to take steps at your request. This applies for installation (data gathered by the browser and / or app store) and the use of our products.</p>
<h4 id="compliance-permission">Collection and processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Controller is subject – Art. 6 (1) c <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr></h4>

<p>The collection and processing of your personal data may be necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests. We collect and process website logs for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, preventing denial of service attacks. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. Preventing such overloads of our systems and any security issues by denial of service attacks is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use the website logs. We use information collected and processed via subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications and feedback data sent by you, for technical reasons, such as, but not limited to, ensuring the security of the extension version used by you. Ensuring the security of our extension is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data. Furthermore, we collect and process such data to ensure that our website and extension are constantly improved and adjusted to the changing requirements for an efficient usability and the technical environment. Ensuring the usability of our websites and of our products is in your and our vital interest and therefore we use such data.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure">Do we disclose any personal data?</h3>
<p>We may only transfer your personal data to third parties without informing you separately beforehand in the following exceptional cases as explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>If required for legal proceedings / investigations, personal data will be transferred to the criminal investigation authorities and, if appropriate, to injured third parties. We will only do this if there are concrete indications of illegal and / or abusive behavior. We are also legally obliged to give certain public authorities information. These are criminal investigation authorities, public authorities which prosecute administrative offences entailing fines and the German finance authorities.</li>
<li>As part of the further development of our business, it may happen that the structure of eyeo GmbH changes. The legal structure may be adapted, subsidiaries, business units or components may be created, bought or sold. In such transactions user information may be shared with the transmitted part of the company. In the event of a transfer of personal information eyeo GmbH will ensure that it is done in accordance to this privacy policy and the <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> and applicable <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr> laws and German data protection laws.</li>

<h5 id="subscription-downloads">Subscription downloads</h5>
<p>If you add filter subscriptions to your Adblock Plus installation, the subscription will be requested to regularly retrieve updates. Every update results in the hosting website receiving your IP address as well as some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser and browser version.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a subscription download fails on several consecutive occasions, the updated address of the filter list is requested from the AdblockPlus.org domain. The data transmitted includes the Adblock Plus version, subscription address and any information about the error encountered. This data is used to identify issues that have not been reported by subscription maintainers and is subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="issue-reporter">Issue Reporter</h5>
<p>Adblock Plus allows you to send issue reports that will be temporarily stored on the AdblockPlus.org website. These reports contain information required to investigate the issue including the Adblock Plus version, browser version, address of the web page where the problem is visible, blockable items on the web page, matching filters, active subscriptions, type of issue report (i.e. false positive or false negative), and a screenshot of the issue (it is possible to remove particularly sensitive sections of the page before the report is sent). Parameter values are removed from all transmitted addresses to avoid unintentionally leaking private information.</p>
<p>You can  voluntarily:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your email address in order for us to request more information from you or to update you on the issue.</li>
<li>Include an optional comment about the issue.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="access-reports">Access to the reports</h5>
<p>The processed reports can only be accessed by an individual who knows their unique ID. These IDs are only shared with:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintainers of the filter subscriptions mentioned in the report, as EasyList authors, who are not employed at eyeo.</li>
<li>Certain members of eyeo’s filter list team. eyeo will use the reports for troubleshooting and support monitoring purposes only.</li>
</ol>
<h5 id="emergency-notification">Emergency notification</h5>
<p>Adblock Plus contains an emergency notification mechanism that allows it to notify users about important issues affecting their Adblock Plus installation. This feature requires all Adblock Plus installations to query an address in the AdblockPlus.org domain regularly to retrieve the list of active notifications. This request makes your IP address visible to the website and also sends some general information like your Adblock Plus version, browser, browser version and the number of previous Adblock Plus downloads (the download number is limited to four, and will be displayed as 4+ after reaching this number). This data allows serving different notifications to different clients and is subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="further-requests">Further requests</h5>
<p>Adblock Plus may make further requests to AdblockPlus.org as required. For example, a documentation link is clicked or the full list of filter subscriptions needs to be downloaded. These requests are subject to this <a href="https://adblockplus.org/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<h5 id="data-retention">Data retention</h5>
<p>Data related to subscription downloads, extension update checks, emergency notifications, Issue Reporter data (as well as the full reports and their associated data) are automatically removed after 30 days. Only a subset of the data will be kept longer. This includes only the country code of users filing an issue (extracted from the IP address) for analytic purposes, which is stored separately from the full reports and cannot be connected to an individual after deletion of the full reports.</p>
<p>Adblock Plus stores some data in <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Profiles">the Firefox profile</a> on your computer. Adblock Plus never transmits this data to any servers, but other extensions and services, such as <a href="https://mozilla.com/privacy-policy/">Firefox Sync</a>, may do so. Most of the data (your preferences, filter subscriptions and custom filters) is unobjectionable privacy-wise. However, filter hit statistics and recent issue reports could be used to reconstruct your browsing history. Adblock Plus treats this information identically to how history data is treated by the browser; this data isn&#39;t stored if you are using <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Private+Browsing">private browsing mode</a> and is removed if you choose to clear your browsing history.</p>

<h6 id="google-tag-manager">Google Tag Manager</h6>
<p>Our Website uses Google Tag Manager for the implementation of <a href="#google-analytics">Google Analytics</a>. Google Tag Manager, provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&quot;Google”), is a solution that allows marketed website tags to be managed using an interface. The Tag Manager tool itself (which implements the tags) is a cookie-less domain and does not register personal data. The tool causes other tags to be activated. These tags then may register data under certain deactivated domains or on a cookie level. This setting will remain in place for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager.</p>
<h6 id="google-optimize">Google Optimize</h6>
<p>Our Website uses the web analysis and optimization service Google Optimize provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&quot;Google”). We use the Google Optimize service to increase the attractiveness, content and functionality of our Website by playing new features and content to a percentage of our users and statistically evaluating the usage change (A/B testing). Google Optimize is a sub-service of <a href="#google-analytics">Google Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Google Optimize uses cookies, which enable us to optimize and analyze your use of our Website. The information generated by these cookies about your use of our Website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. We use Google Optimize with activated IP anonymization so that your IP address is shortened by Google within member states of the European Union, or within the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of our Website, compiling reports on optimization tests and related website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage.</p>
<p><strong>You can deactivate Google Optimize if you do not want to help us improve our products.</strong> But please note that in this case, a cookie will be set that stores your deactivation choice. This cookie is considered a “necessary cookie” and can’t be deactivated.</p>

<h6 id="adblock-ai">At adblock.ai</h6>
<p>On our website, adblock.ai, we automatically collect the following information:</p>
<p id="facebook-messenger-integration"><strong>Facebook Messenger integration</strong></p>
<p>We have embedded the Facebook Messenger functionality, owned by Facebook, Inc., into the adblock.ai website to enable you to submit screenshots to our bot (“Adblock AI”) via Messenger, without having to access the Facebook website. Please note that Messenger is hosted by Facebook. We have disabled the function that would otherwise send personal data to Facebook when you access our website; however, when you click on the button to help train Adblock AI with your screenshots (“START NOW”) you will activate Messenger. Only then will some personal data, including IP address, be transferred to Facebook. For more information, please review Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://facebook.com/privacy/explanation">Privacy Policy</a>. <strong>If you do not want to transfer data to Facebook, please do not click on the button to send information to Adblock AI through Facebook Messenger.</strong></p>
<h5 id="voluntary-info">Information you give to us on a voluntary basis</h5>
<p>The Adblock Plus <a href="https://adblockplus.org/forum/">forum</a> and <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/">blog</a> are both publicly available to all visitors. If you write a post or comment, we collect and process personal data as follows:</p>
<h6 id="forum-registration">Forum registration</h6>
<p>We use personal data you entered during forum registration to form the user&#39;s public profile, which is visible to other forum visitors for the purpose that users can associate forum posts with a particular person.</p>
<p>Passwords and email addresses will not be visible to other forum visitors.</p>
<ul>
<li>Passwords go through one-way encryption before they are stored on the server.</li>
<li>Email addresses are only displayed in the public profile if explicitly agreed to. By default, they are only used for the sending of notifications to which you subscribed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Registration is not required to read articles in the forum and you can delete your account at any time.</p>
<h6 id="blog-comments">Blog comments</h6>
<p>When you add a comment on the Adblock Plus <a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/">blog</a>, you can optionally specify an email address. Unlike the other fields, the email address is never displayed to other visitors and is only used to notify the comment author about replies to their comments, if any.</p>
<h6 id="email-collection">Email collection</h6>
<p>Some of eyeo&#39;s Websites host product campaigns that rely on email collection. For example, you can request a link by email to install Adblock Browser on your mobile device. We do not use third parties to manage these campaigns. Instead, data that you submit is handled in-house (i.e. turned into an email or used to send the email). We will never share or sell your email address, or any other information collected, to any third parties.</p>
<h6 id="retention-communications">Email collection</h6>
<p>Data provided by you in connection with our blog and our forum will be retained for the same time as the comment and / or your account exists.</p>
<p>In general, we do not store your email address unless it’s specifically required to execute the related campaign (i.e. email signups for a newsletter or signing up to get notified about a product launch). In cases where we do store your email address, we only store it for the length of time that is needed to execute the campaign (i.e. once you’ve been notified of the launch).</p>
