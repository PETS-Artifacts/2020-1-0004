                <h3>Overleaf Privacy &amp; Terms Overview</h3>
                <p>Last Modified: 6th September 2016</p>
            </div>
    <p>
    Thank you for using Overleaf! Here are our full Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Security Overview and Acceptable Use Policy for use of the Overleaf service.

    </p>
    <h3>Privacy as Standard</h3>
    <p>
    Every project you create is automatically private. Other Overleaf users can't see your files in Overleaf unless you deliberately share the links to your projects.
    </p>
    <p>
    For each project, Overleaf creates a unique token used only for the link to that project. It is almost impossible to guess the token, and hence the link to your project is known only to you.
    </p>
    <p>
    Please note however that if you publish the link to your project on a website or somewhere public, anybody can use the link and the website where your link is posted might even be included in search engines.
    </p>

    <h3>General Disclaimer</h3>
    <p>
    This software is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranty of any kind,
    express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of
    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no
    event shall John Lees-Miller, John Hammersley or any other contributor be liable
    for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in an action of contract,
    tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the software or
    the use or other dealings in the software.
    </p>

  <div id="Terms">
    <div class="section-title">
        <h3>Overleaf Terms of Service</h3>
        <p>Last Modified: 20th December 2014</p>
    </div>
<p>
These terms of service (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”) govern your access to and use of Overleaf websites and services (the “<strong>Services</strong>”) provided by Writelatex Limited (“<strong>we</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>” or “<strong>Writelatex</strong>”), so please carefully read them before using the Services.
</p>
<p>
By using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and promising that you have the authority to bind that organization to these terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization.
</p>
<p>
You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms. You may use the Services only if you have the power to form a contract with Writelatex and are not barred under any applicable laws from doing so. The Services may continue to change over time as we refine and add more features. We may stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you (but recognising your work is important to you, please read the note below on access to your files in these circumstances). We may also remove any content from our Services at our discretion.
</p>
<h3>Your Stuff &amp; Your Privacy</h3>
<p>
By using our Services you provide us with information, files, and folders that you submit to Overleaf and Writelatex (together, “your stuff”). You retain full ownership to your stuff. We don’t claim any ownership to any of it. These Terms do not grant us any rights to your stuff or intellectual property except for the limited rights that are needed to run the Services, as explained below.
</p>
<p>
We may need your permission to do things you ask us to do with your stuff, for example, hosting your files, or sharing them at your direction. This includes product features visible to you, for example, image thumbnails or project previews. It also includes design choices we make to technically administer our Services, for example, how we redundantly backup data to keep it safe. You give us the permissions we need to do those things solely to provide the Services. This permission also extends to trusted third parties we work with to provide the Services, for example Amazon, which provides our main storage space (again, only to provide the Services).
</p>
<p>
To be clear, aside from the rare exceptions we identify in our Privacy Policy, no matter how the Services change, we won’t share your content with others, including law enforcement, for any purpose unless you direct us to. How we collect and use your information generally is also explained in our Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
You are solely responsible for your conduct, the content of your files and folders, and your communications with others while using the Services. For example, it’s your responsibility to ensure that you have the rights or permission needed to comply with these Terms.
</p>
<p>
We may choose to review public content for compliance with our community guidelines, but you acknowledge that Writelatex has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. We are not responsible for the accuracy, completeness, appropriateness, or legality of files, user posts, or any other information you may be able to access using the Services.
</p>
<p>
Although we reserve the right to stop, suspend, or modify the Services at any time without prior notice to you, we recognise that your stuff is important to you, and that you may wish to retrieve your stuff from Overleaf in this event. We will make reasonable effort to contact you if you have registered for an account, and aim to keep your stuff available for retrieval from Overleaf in read-only form for up to 3 months beyond the time of suspension (or otherwise) of the Services.
</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Stuff</h3>
<p>
The Services provide features that allow you to share your stuff with others or to make it public. There are many things that users may do with that stuff (for example, copy it, modify it, re-share it). Please consider carefully what you choose to share or make public. Writelatex has no responsibility for that activity.
</p>
<h3>Your Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
Files and other content in the Services may be protected by intellectual property rights of others. Please do not copy, upload, download, or share files unless you have the right to do so. You, not Writelatex, will be fully responsible and liable for what you copy, share, upload, download or otherwise use while using the Services. You must not upload spyware or any other malicious software to the Service.
</p>
<p>
You, and not Writelatex, are responsible for maintaining and protecting all of your stuff. Writelatex will not be liable for any loss or corruption of your stuff, or for any costs or expenses associated with backing up or restoring any of your stuff.
</p>
<p>
If your contact information, or other information related to your account, changes, you must notify us promptly and keep your information current. The Services are not intended for use by you if you are under 13 years of age. By agreeing to these Terms, you are representing to us that you are over 13.
</p>
<h3>Account Security</h3>
<p>
You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Services and you agree not to disclose your password to any third party. You are responsible for any activity using your account, whether or not you authorized that activity. You should immediately notify Writelatex of any unauthorized use of your account. You acknowledge that if you wish to protect your transmission of data or files to Overleaf, it is your responsibility to use a secure encrypted connection to communicate with the Services.
</p>
<h3>Overleaf Property and Feedback</h3>
<p>
These terms do not grant you any right, title, or interest in the Services, or the content in the Services. While we appreciate it when users send us feedback, please be aware that we may use any feedback, comments, or suggestions you send us or post in our forums without any obligation to you. The technology we use to provide the Services are protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of England and Wales. These Terms do not grant you any rights to use the Overleaf / Writelatex trademarks, logos, domain names, or other brand features.
</p>
<h3>Acceptable Use Policy</h3>
<p>
You will not, and will not attempt to, misuse the Services, and will use the Services only in a manner consistent with the Overleaf Acceptable Use Policy.
</p>
<h3>Other Content</h3>
<p>
The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources. Writelatex does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for their availability, accuracy, the related content, products, or services. You are solely responsible for your use of any such websites or resources. Also, if we provide you with any software under an open source license, there may be provisions in those licenses that expressly conflict with these Terms, in which case the open source provisions will apply.
</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>
Though we’d much rather you stay, you can stop using our Services any time. We reserve the right to suspend or end the Services at any time, with or without cause, and with or without notice. For example, we may suspend or terminate your use if you are not complying with these Terms, or use the Services in any way that would cause us legal liability or disrupt others’ use of the Services. If we suspend or terminate your use, we will try to let you know in advance and help you retrieve data, though there may be some cases (for example, repeatedly or flagrantly violating these Terms, a court order, or danger to other users) where we may suspend immediately.
</p>
<h3>Overleaf is Available “AS-IS”</h3>
<p>
Though we want to provide a great service, there are certain things about the service we can’t promise. For example, THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, AT YOUR OWN RISK, WITHOUT EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. WE ALSO DISCLAIM ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. (We are not shouting- it’s just that these disclaimers are really important, so we want to highlight them). Writelatex will have no responsibility for any harm to your computer system, loss or corruption of data, or other harm that results from your access to or use of the Services. Some US states do not allow the types of disclaimers in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>
<h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL WRITELATEX, ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUPPLIERS OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR (A) Any indirect, special, incidental, punitive, exemplary or consequential (including loss of use, data, business, or profits) damages, regardless of legal theory, whether or not Writelatex has been warned of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy fails of its essential purpose; (B) Aggregate liability for all claims relating to the Services more than the greater of £0.01 or the amounts paid by you to Writelatex for the past three months of the services in question. Some US states do not allow the types of limitations in this paragraph, so they may not apply to you.
</p>
<h3>Modifications</h3>
<p>
We may revise these Terms from time to time and the most current version will always be posted on our website. If a revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you (for example via email to the email address associated with your account). Other changes may be posted to our news or terms page, so please check those pages regularly. By continuing to access or use the Services after revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Services.
</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Legal Terms</h3>
<p>
THESE TERMS AND THE USE OF THE SERVICES AND SOFTWARE WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF ENGLAND AND WALES EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR THE SERVICES OR SOFTWARE MUST BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN ENGLAND AND WALES, AND BOTH PARTIES CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION THERE. These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive agreement between you and Writelatex with respect to the Services, and supersede and replace any other agreements, terms and conditions applicable to the Services. These Terms create no third party beneficiary rights. Writelatex's failure to enforce a provision is not a waiver of its right to do so later. If a provision is found unenforceable the remaining provisions of the Agreement will remain in full effect and an enforceable term will be substituted reflecting our intent as closely as possible. You may not assign any of your rights in these Terms, and any such attempt is void, but Writelatex may assign its rights to
any of
its affiliates or subsidiaries, or to any successor in interest of any business associated with the Services. Writelatex and you are not legal partners or agents; instead, our relationship is that of independent contractors.

This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Overleaf Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information.”
</p>
<h3>1. The Information We Collect And Store</h3>
<p>
We may collect and store the following information when running the Overleaf Service:
</p>
<p>
<em>Information You Provide.</em>   When you register an account, we collect some personal information, such as your name and email address. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer Overleaf to you.
</p>
<p>
<em>Files.</em>   We collect and store the files you upload, download, or access with the Overleaf Service (“Files”). If you add a file to your Overleaf that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.
</p>
<p>
<em>Log Data.</em>   When you use the Service, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.
</p>
<p>
<em>Cookies.</em>   We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Service.
</p>
<h3>2. How We Use Personal Information</h3>
<p>
<em>Personal Information.</em>   In the course of using the Service, we may collect personal information that can be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information is or may be used: (i) to provide and improve our Service, (ii) to administer your use of the Service, (iii) to better understand your needs and interests, (iv) to personalize and improve your experience, and (v) to provide or offer software updates and product announcements. If you no longer wish to receive communications from us, please follow the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of those communications, or update your account settings information.
</p>
<p>
<em>Geo-Location Information.</em>   Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). Our mobile apps do not collect such information from your mobile device at any time while you download or use our mobile apps as of the date this policy went into effect, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. Some photos you place in Overleaf may contain recorded location information. We do not use this information, but may do so in the future with your consent to improve our Services. If you do not wish to share files embedded with your geo-location information with us, please do not upload them. If you don’t want to store location data in your photos or videos, please consult the documentation for your camera to turn off that feature. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can sometimes be used to approximate a Device’s location.
</p>
<p>
<em>Analytics.</em>   We also collect some information (ourselves or using third party services) using logging and cookies, such as IP address, which can sometimes be correlated with Personal Information. We use this information for the above purposes and to monitor and analyze use of the Service, for the Service’s technical administration, to increase our Service’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to verify users have the authorization needed for the Service to process their requests. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Google Analytics. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, and to learn how to opt out of that service, please visit the Google Analytics website.
</p>
<h3>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
<p>
<em>Your Use.</em>   We will display your Personal Information in your profile page and elsewhere on the Service according to the preferences you set in your account. Any information you choose to provide should reflect how much you want others to know about you. Please consider carefully what information you disclose in your profile page and your desired level of anonymity. You can review and revise your profile information at any time. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below). Through certain features of the Service, you may also have the ability to make some of your information public. Public information may be broadly and quickly disseminated.
</p>
<p>
<em>Your affiliations.</em> When you join a group/team on the Service, either by accepting an invitation to that group or by confirming your affiliation to that group (e.g. by confirming your university email address), you are added to the list of members for that group on the Service. This list may be managed by administrators of the Service and/or external administrators for that group (e.g. university staff), and these administrators have access to information such as: your email address, profile information, and aggregate statistics on usage.
</p>
<p>
<em>Service Providers, Business Partners and Others.</em>   We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon’s S3 storage service to store some of your information (for example, your Files). You can find more information on Amazon's data security from the S3 website.
</p>
<p>
<em>Third-Party Applications.</em>   We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access our Services through such an application. We are not responsible for what those parties do with your information, so you should make sure you trust the application and that it has a privacy policy acceptable to you.
</p>
<p>
<em>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Writelatex's Rights.</em>   We may disclose to parties outside Overleaf files stored in your Overleaf and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; (b) protect the safety of any person from death or serious bodily injury; (c) prevent fraud or abuse of Overleaf or its users; or (d) to protect Writelatex’s property rights. If we provide your Overleaf files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Overleaf's encryption (if any has been added) from the files before providing them to law enforcement. However, Overleaf will not be able to decrypt any files that you encrypted prior to storing them on Overleaf.
</p>
<p>
<em>Business Transfers.</em>   If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy. We will also notify you of choices you may have regarding the information.
</p>
<p>
<em>Non-private or Non-Personal Information.</em>   We may disclose your non-private, aggregated, or otherwise non-personal information, such as usage statistics of our Service.
</p>
<h3>4. Changing or Deleting Your Information</h3>
<p>If you are a registered user, you may review, update, correct or delete the Personal Information provided in your registration or account profile by changing your “account settings.” If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may update or delete it by making the change on your account settings. In some cases we may retain copies of your information if required by law.

<h3>5. Data Retention</h3>

We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request. Please note, however, that there might be latency in deleting information from our servers and backed-up versions might exist after deletion. In addition, we do not delete from our servers files that you have in common with other users.
</p>
<h3>6. Overleaf Community</h3>
<p>
Our Service offers publicly accessible community services such as blogs, forums, and wikis. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. Your posts may remain even after you cancel your account.

<h3>7. Security</h3>
<p>
The security of your information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).
</p>
<p>
We follow generally accepted standards to protect the information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100&#37; secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

            <h3>Overleaf Security Overview</h3>
            <p>Last Modified: 20th December 2014</p>
        </div>
<p>
We provide this overview so that you can better understand the security measures we’ve put in place to protect the information that you store using Overleaf.
</p>
<h3>Secure Storage</h3>
<p>
Overleaf uses Amazon S3 for data storage. Amazon stores data over several large-scale data centers. According to Amazon, they use military grade perimeter control beams, video surveillance, and professional security staff to keep their data centers physically secure.
</p>
<p>
You can find more information about Amazon's security at the Amazon Web Services' website.
</p>
<p>
Amazon also employ significant protection against network security issues such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks, and packet sniffing.
</p>
<h3>Secure Transfers</h3>
<p>
Your files are sent to our servers over a secure channel using 256-bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption where supported, the standard for secure Internet network connections.
</p>
<h3>Your Data is Backed Up</h3>
<p>
Through Amazon, Overleaf keeps redundant backups of all data over multiple locations to prevent the remote possibility of data loss. To cover the unlikely event that this redundancy were to fail, we recommend you keep local copies of your important files on your personal computer.
</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>
A copy of our full privacy policy can be read by selecting the Privacy Policy tab above.
</p>
<p>
We guard your privacy to the best of our ability and work hard to protect your information from unauthorized access.
</p>
<h3>Third-party Apps</h3>
<p>
If you choose to access Overleaf using third-party applications (“apps”), be aware that those apps utilize their own security protocols and have their own privacy policies. If you’re not comfortable with the privacy and security features of those apps, you shouldn’t use them to access Overleaf. For example, third-party apps might not employ encryption when transmitting data, might collect information that Overleaf does not, and might use information differently than Overleaf does.
</p>
<h3>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h3>
<p>As set forth in our privacy policy, and in compliance with the laws of England and Wales, Writelatex cooperates with law enforcement when it receives valid legal process, which may require Writelatex to provide the contents of your private Overleaf account. In these cases, Writelatex will remove Overleaf’s encryption (if any has been added) from the files before providing them to law enforcement.
</p>
<h3>I think I've found a security exploit. Where do I report security concerns?</h3>
<p>
We take a number of measures to ensure that the data you store on Overleaf is safe and secure. While we're very confident in our technology, we recognize that no system can guarantee data security with 100&#37; certainty. For that reason, we will continue to innovate to make sure that our security measures are state of the art, and we will investigate any and all reported security issues concerning Overleaf's services or software. For a direct line to our security experts, report security issues to <script id="mail_to-mm2pb6tk">eval(decodeURIComponent('%76%61%72%20%73%63%72%69%70%74%20%3d%20%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%67%65%74%45%6c%65%6d%65%6e%74%42%79%49%64%28%27%6d%61%69%6c%5f%74%6f%2d%6d%6d%32%70%62%36%74%6b%27%29%3b%76%61%72%20%61%20%3d%20%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%63%72%65%61%74%65%45%6c%65%6d%65%6e%74%28%27%61%27%29%3b%61%2e%73%65%74%41%74%74%72%69%62%75%74%65%28%27%68%72%65%66%27%2c%20%27%6d%61%69%6c%74%6f%3a%73%65%63%75%72%69%74%79%40%6f%76%65%72%6c%65%61%66%2e%63%6f%6d%27%29%3b%61%2e%61%70%70%65%6e%64%43%68%69%6c%64%28%64%6f%63%75%6d%65%6e%74%2e%63%72%65%61%74%65%54%65%78%74%4e%6f%64%65%28%27%73%65%63%75%72%69%74%79%40%6f%76%65%72%6c%65%61%66%2e%63%6f%6d%27%29%29%3b%73%63%72%69%70%74%2e%70%61%72%65%6e%74%4e%6f%64%65%2e%69%6e%73%65%72%74%42%65%66%6f%72%65%28%61%2c%73%63%72%69%70%74%29%3b'))</script><noscript>security at (our domain)</noscript>.
